 Bill Cosby spent half the movie reassuring us that he's not racist. He's not, he said, he doesn't hold those kinds of views! He's a nice guy, he's a good guy, he's a good man! So was I he said. I was half convinced by that. In the second half, he had to "shock" us with the fact that he was a racist. It was obvious that he had to do it, because it was a requirement for the movie to make any sense at all. He played the role of a racist well, as if he was doing a part in some racist play. The problem was that he was doing a part in a movie, not a play. During the first half, I was sitting there trying to figure out what this movie was about. It was about a guy who was a racist. I kept waiting for the movie to explain that the guy was a racist because of his childhood. That never happened. The movie just kept throwing out the fact that the guy was a racist and I kept waiting for it to explain it. It never happened. And then, during the last half of the movie, I couldn't believe that Cosby was a racist. I couldn't believe
 This movie has not aged well at all. The script is rather silly, the pacing is flat and the acting is atrocious. In fact, I'm surprised that this movie has any cult following at all. Essentially, the plot is that some people get transported to hell when they die and they have to fight their way back.<br /><br />The characters are not very well developed and most of them are simply there to provide a plot device. The movie is actually not all that bad in that regard, as it is not any worse than most horror movies of the time. However, the movie is not for everyone. The acting is atrocious and the dialogue is not very good at all. The pacing is bad and the camera work is also not very good. The movie also has a lot of annoying CG effects which detract from the film.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for hardcore horror fans only. Not for anyone else.

 I have to say that I'm really surprised that so many people have rated this movie so highly. First of all, the movie was bad enough when I watched it on TV, but now that it's on DVD, it's even worse.<br /><br />The true story of the Amish, who like the Moravians, are an immigrant group who banded together as a religious community, is fascinating. I like the idea of a group of people who are so different from the rest of the world. What they believe in, how they live is so different, it makes you think. I love the Amish, but I don't want to see a group of people who are so different from the rest of us becoming American made-for-TV movie heroes. The Amish are simple people who have a very hard life. They're farmers, which is a very tough job. They have to work in the fields, tend to their livestock and have to deal with the weather, to name a few of the things they have to do.<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is that the Amish have a school, but the school is being picked on by the local townspeople. They are
 The funniest character is the film's narrator, a pompous, self-important fellow with a Yorkshire accent, a self-imposed title (Master of Ceremonies) and a penchant for quoting Montaigne. In fact, the movie is so self-consciously funny that I'm surprised it made any money.<br /><br />The movie purports to be about a group of people on a trip to Italy. The group includes a stuffy academic, a beautiful woman, a shy man, a nerd, two sisters, and an Italian guy. It's a very long film, and it takes forever to get to the point. In the meantime, the members of the group make a huge amount of small talk, and Mr. Montaigne (sorry, Master of Ceremonies) makes a lot of small-minded remarks.<br /><br />In the end, the movie is a thoroughly enjoyable waste of time. A lot of people will like it, though, and that's why I can't give it a thumbs down.

INCREDIBLY FUNNY!


 I saw this movie on television the other night and I was ready to quit. I had not seen it before and I thought that it was absolutely the worst movie I had ever seen. I have since read the other reviews and found out that I had seen the worst movie of all time. Apparently, this is the most hated movie of all time. The movie is absolutely awful. I laughed so hard that I couldn't catch my breath. I became a born again Christian and now I can't wait to get my life back. This is god's way of punishing me for having seen that movie. I am sure that this is the same movie that has made me so happy that I don't want to leave my house. I am going to burn this DVD and hope to god that this movie never makes it to DVD. I know that it is going to be a huge hit and that more people are going to see this movie than I will. It is going to be a huge hit because people are just looking for a good laugh and they will see this movie and think that it is the worst thing that they have ever seen. I am going to buy a gun and commit suicide.

 I was so excited to see this film at the cinema but it was a complete let down. The acting was poor and the story was not convincing. It had some good elements in it but they were not enough to compensate for the lack of story and the poor acting.

The film is quite rubbish. The only good thing I can say about it is that there were two scenes where the actors actually kept the audience spellbound, but they were too few to make it worthwhile.

I was not impressed and I do not recommend this film to anyone.

I saw this film in the cinema.

I found the story to be quite interesting and I liked the idea of being able to see the action from the point of view of the killer. The idea that the killer's personality changes through the film and is shown completely different from the killer in the beginning of the film was very clever. However, the film was very slow in parts and the script did not give the audience much to think about. A lot of the dialogue was quite boring and it was hard to believe that it was from the killer's point of view.

The acting was horrible and did not
 A young man is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend. She was killed when she discovered his secret life as a male prostitute. The movie focuses on the relationship between the two and the guilt and stress of the young man. It is interesting to watch the story unfold and follow along. But, the movie is not particularly well written or directed. There is a lot of back and forth and not much explanation. The film is filled with some very gory scenes. I would suggest that people that are squeamish should avoid this film. The gore is pretty realistic and it is said to be a documentary.

 I went to see this movie with my friends and we were very disappointed. I think that we were not the only ones. We were expecting some kind of a comedy, but the only thing that we got were two characters that were extremely irritating and annoying. The first one was the girl, who was very annoying and tried to be smart all the time. The second one was the guy, who was not funny at all. He made fun of everything and everyone, including the man that they were supposed to save. The story was very boring and it's not something that you go and see just because it's a movie that you have to see. I don't know if I will ever see a movie of this kind again, because it was really a waste of time and money.

The worst part about this movie was that it was in Spanish. I don't know if it was just me, but I really wanted to understand the movie, but I couldn't. The words were all mixed up. So, if you don't speak Spanish and you want to see it, don't let yourself be fooled by the fact that it's in Spanish, because it's not worth it.

 I watched this movie because I am a huge fan of the original (it is in fact the best movie of all time). It is just plain awful. This movie has the same plot as the original, but it is so boring and the acting is so bad that I couldn't make it through the whole movie. I'm not a big fan of the original at all, but I would say that I like the original better than this. The acting is so bad in this movie that it is almost laughable, and the plot is just plain boring. If you want to see an action movie, watch the original instead. It is way better than this. The original has a really good plot and some really interesting and funny parts. I really liked the original and it is, in my opinion, the best movie of all time. So, if you want to see a really funny and good action movie, watch the original instead. I really recommend this movie to only people who are huge fans of the original and who have nothing else to do. If you have actually seen the original, you probably won't like this movie very much.

 One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Oh, sure, it has a few redeeming qualities--for example, it's pretty cool to see a guy in a wheelchair surfing--but those are pretty much outweighed by the fact that this movie is so unfunny that it makes the good parts in Airplane! look like the funniest movie ever. Not that I've ever seen it, but I've heard a lot of people saying that, and I can see why. Airplane! is that good. If you want to laugh, watch Airplane! If you want to see a bad movie, watch this. And then, no doubt, you'll wake up feeling bad about watching it.<br /><br />Oh, and just to be clear, the guy sitting next to me was laughing the whole time. Not that I'm complaining, or anything.

 I was quite disappointed with this movie. It really has no plot, or anything really, to speak of. It tries to be a comedy and it fails miserably. The problem isn't the actors, it's the movie itself. I would recommend renting it for the actors, but don't waste your time or money on this one.

**Spoiler alert** I don't know what the hell happened at the end. All I could think of was, "What the hell is that?" The movie just ended like it was suppose to. It felt like the movie had no point, and it didn't.

If you're thinking about seeing this movie, don't. You will be disappointed.

 I have to say that this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. I have seen all of the episodes, I have played the game, and I have read the book. However, I was still bored by this movie. The only part that I enjoyed was when the characters and the actors were singing. I could not stand the rest of the movie. I would have been just as bored if I had watched the movie alone. It was so boring that at one point I drifted off to sleep. The only good thing about this movie is that it does not draw out the ending. The ending is not as good as the book, but it is still good.

Boring, boring, boring.

My favorite character is Lea, but she does not have much to do in this movie.

Rating: 2/5

I recommend this movie to someone who likes reading and playing the game, but not to someone who likes to watch movies.

I would say to see this movie if you have already seen it, or if you have an interest in it.

This is the first time I have written a review for a movie, so I apologize if it is not good.


 I don't know what it is about this movie that is so bad, but whatever it is, it's here in spades. I love a good martial arts movie, but this one is just not worth seeing. I've never seen such a poor plot, characters, or acting. The only good thing I can say about this is that it is a quick and enjoyable movie. It's not worth buying, but renting it is okay, just to see how bad it really is.

 I loved the first movie and the original anime series. This movie is just a lame, shallow rehash. It has all of the characters, the same plot, and the same dialogue. It's a shame. I really thought this would be an improvement on the original. I didn't like the director's cut of the first story and I didn't think this movie did anything to improve on it. It was a waste of my time. If you are a fan of the first movie and the series, then you'll probably like this. I don't recommend that you buy a ticket to see it.

I have to say, I liked the first anime. It was humorous, dramatic, and fast paced. This movie, on the other hand, is very boring. It's really nothing more than a rehash of the original story. There is nothing new here except maybe a few more characters. I think the first series was much better. The characters were much more interesting and the action was much better. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

 I thought it was an alright movie for the most part. It was a little over the top with the way it was written and the way it was shot, but it was good enough to keep me interested.<br /><br />I liked the movie because it was entertaining and I liked the way it was shot. But there were a few things that bothered me. For one, they were telling a story of a girl that was being abused, but she wasn't really abused. She just got too overprotective of her brother, who was getting abused. And, she didn't really talk to her father about it, which was a little irritating for me.<br /><br />Overall, it was an alright movie.<br /><br />Grade: 3/10

**SPOILER**It wasn't good because at the end when she's getting killed, and her father is trying to take a picture of her and her killer is trying to run away, he says 'I'm sorry' to the killer, and the killer looks at him and replies 'It's not your fault.' I thought that was pretty bad because it was supposed to be a tragic moment, but they ruined it completely by making it look like
 This is a film I stumbled upon by chance. I thought it was going to be a bit of fun but was a bit disappointed when it turned into a complete and utter mess.<br /><br />There are twenty odd minutes of almost non-stop bad acting in this film. It has all the hallmarks of bad acting. The characters are completely unrecognisable from their real life counterparts.<br /><br />The film is entirely filled with bad acting and a never ending, nonsensical plot. The film is basically one long, endless scene with endless bad acting. There is no real story, no real plot and no real acting to actually make it work. The acting is simply bad and the writing is just as bad.<br /><br />It's a long and drawn out bad film. It's not worth the time of day and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

The Devil's Carnival (2011)

* * * *

The Devil's Carnival was released two years ago and already it has a notorious reputation as one of the worst horror films ever made. The most infamous quote from the film is when the director shouts "F**k you!" at the camera
 The movie is not even on netflix, and i rented it at Blockbuster. The movie is awful. It was hard to watch because it's so bad. I don't even know how they made it through the editing process. There were so many mistakes, and the U.S. actors were just terrible. I have never been so embarrassed for someone that I watched in a movie. I don't know why I rented it and I am so disgusted with myself for having done so. I was really hoping for a good movie to rent, but instead I got a bunch of people who didn't know how to act, and I can't believe I rented it. I would recommend it to people who like bad movies, then they can laugh at themselves when they watch this. I am so embarrassed to have watched something so bad.

 I have to say that anyone who has seen the original version of this movie will find the remake lacking. Not only is it not nearly as good, but it misses out on a lot of the subtle humor and nuance of the original. I don't want to be too harsh, as I think most people will enjoy this film, but it just doesn't have the same impact as the original. That being said, the story is still very good and the special effects are terrific. I was impressed with the way the two were interwoven. And the ending, while not the same, is still very satisfying. It's just a shame that the new version is not even in the same league as the original.

If you want to see the original, rent this one or buy the VHS. If you want to see the remake, rent the VHS or buy the DVD.

 The story is not half bad. The problem is that this movie was made in 1997, but it looks like something from the 80's. It's a shame, as the script is about a young girl who gets mixed up with some bad people, who then become mixed up with her. Normally I wouldn't mind, but from what I've seen from this movie, it is just not on par with the rest of the genre. It doesn't have any of the style or the charm that most others do. The acting is not only bad, but the two main characters were just not the kind of people that I would want to be around. I would have felt more comfortable if they had just been normal people in the first place, then they would have been able to seem more realistic. But it's not to say that the movie is bad, it just doesn't have the style I would have liked to see in a movie like this. I would have liked to see a little more action, but it's not to say that it's bad. There's a few suspenseful moments in the film, which helps it be better than it is.

The film looks a lot better than it actually is, but I have to say
 The film is basically a good idea with a terrible execution. This movie basically is a really fast paced sequence of a bunch of characters who are trying to escape a death sentence that they are given. The movie is so fast paced that you have a hard time understanding what is going on. They try to explain some stuff but it is not enough. The movie is very predictable and it kind of makes you feel like you already know what is going to happen. I also felt like I saw it before, just a different name. The cast is good but the movie is not. I think it was worth watching just for the cast, but it is not worth buying.

*Note: I have seen this movie so many times that I am pretty sure I know what is going to happen before it does. I can tell the difference between a remake and a sequel though. This movie is a remake of the original called "Cocaine Cowboys."

 The plot and characters are so full of holes it makes my head spin. The plot is so absurd that it's hard to believe anyone would buy it, but the worst part is the characters. They are so blatantly unrealistic that any suspension of disbelief is completely gone.

The film is about a boy named David (played by Ben Stiller), who is a slacker. He has a hard time concentrating and is taking things in a very light-hearted and detached way. His family is on a very tight budget, and he is constantly getting into trouble. He is suspended for three days, but his family's financial situation is so dire that his mother, who is an uncaring robot, must make a deal with a local loan shark in order to keep the family afloat. In order to make the deal, she must have sex with the loan shark. So David has to go to his grandmother's house to get his money, and she is dead.
 This is a very depressing film. It is about a man who is losing his memory and is trying to find out what he has done in his past. It is a very depressing film and it is hard to watch as it made me feel very sorry for the main character. The film is about a man who is looking for his past. He has no memory of who he is and is trying to find out what happened in his past. The plot is very slow and the TV series "Trauma" is better in my opinion. The plot is very slow and nothing happens. This is a very hard film to watch because it has you feeling very sorry for the main character and you do not know what is going to happen to him. I don't recommend this film to anyone as it's a very hard film to watch.<br /><br />I give this film 2/10.

There are better movies out there about faith, love, and trying to find a spouse. The movie did have some beautiful scenes and I applaud the director for that. You can watch this movie and say you have watched a true story, but you wouldn't know it by the movie itself. Don't waste your time.

 It has the right name, but you don't get the right movie. The movie is bad, the title is good. The movie is about a bunch of people who are trying to find their way back home to the U.S. after the war. One of the characters is a German who is captured and sent to a POW camp. The camp is run by a sadistic guard. The main character tries to escape and is shot by the guard in the process. The main character is the only one that comes back to the U.S. The movie is very slow and dull most of the time and you get no answers to any of the questions you ask.

This is a terrible movie and it has nothing to do with World War II.

There is only one good thing about the movie and that is the title.

 I don't think that this movie really qualifies as a horror film at all. It's more like a teen comedy with horror overtones. The acting is not that good. The special effects are mostly laughable. I don't think that it even qualifies as a horror film because there isn't much horror in it. It seems like a talkie version of a bad movie from the 80s. I don't think that the concept of having a group of friends and having them go out to a haunted house on Halloween is a good idea for a movie. The movie just seems like a bad attempt at trying to make a horror film. I think that it would've been better for them to try to make a comedy with horror overtones. I don't think that this movie had much potential. This movie seemed like it was going to be a good horror film from the beginning. The only good part of the movie is that there isn't a lot of blood and guts. The movie is definitely not worth watching. I wish that I could give this movie even a 1/10 rating.

 This movie was a big disappointment to me. I can't take the acting, the plot, the direction, the editing and the special effects seriously. The only thing I enjoyed was the modelling in the movie. This is not a good movie to watch.

The actors look like they are doing a play, not a movie. The plot is not worth watching. The action scenes are badly done.

I should have known better, when Sony Pictures Classics sent me the DVD, to not watch the movie. I was being seduced by the awards and the great reviews.

I watched the movie out of respect for the director, who is a friend of mine. But his directing is not good enough to make a movie of this type. The movie should have been done with a small budget.

The actors don't look like they should be in movies, the plot is not worth watching and the direction is terrible. And the editing is awful. I was expecting a movie to be made with special effects and a good plot, but I got nothing of that.

I decided to watch the movie because some of my friends are involved in the film industry. They always give good reviews, but they know too much about
 One of the worst movies I have ever seen, in the style of a tube TV drama with no story, no acting and no style, it is simply a compilation of scenes with no rhyme or reason, the only redeeming value is the models who were very good.

The film is made up of a group of people who live in a house and are members of a church, they are all nice and kind and good looking, they are all in their late twenties and thirties, which means that the film is very amateurish and lacks a script, the script is non-existent, there is no story, the film has no beginning, it has no middle and it has no end.

The film has no style and no class, the acting is awful, you cannot buy it, the lighting is awful, the sets are awful, the story is awful, the script is awful, the sound is awful, and the models are obviously paid.

I have seen a lot of bad films, and this is one of the worst, it is not funny, it is not scary, it is very unoriginal and it is very badly made.

I have never before seen a film with such an awful
 A lot of people have compared this film to the original "The Shining," but the similarities are few and far between. "Amityville II: The Possession" is a completely different movie, but it is just as bad. The whole movie has a different feel and is something that is hard to describe, other than it is a poor movie. The acting is terrible, the story is confusing, the special effects are cheesy, and the whole movie is just a real mess. The only thing that is good about this movie is the music. The film is so bad that it is even hard to watch it. The only thing that is good about the film is the story. The movie just doesn't make sense, so it is hard to understand. The whole film just is awful. I don't know what else to say about the film other than it is a bad movie. If you are a fan of the original "The Shining," then you will probably like this film. If you like bad movies, then this is a movie for you. I give "Amityville II: The Possession" a 1/10.

**** out of *****.

The DVD:

Video: The video quality is bad
 I actually don't know what's worse about this movie. The first half is a complete waste of time and talent, as the director and all of the actors seem to be having a seizure and couldn't get anything right. They just sit around and talk and jerk around with a camera, and then the second half is a huge let down. I was expecting something more. I was expecting something that would be like a cross between "Apocalypse Now" and "The Big Lebowski." Instead, I got a complete waste of time. This movie is not worth the time of day. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've heard the phrase "I liked it" from someone who watched this. A dollar for every time I've heard the phrase "I liked it" from someone who watched this movie.

"Sleeper": *** (**1/2)

I was pretty happy that I got to see this movie as it was recommended to me. The story just flows and flows. The acting is very simple, but it works well. Visually, it's a very simple film, but it's very effective. I would say that this movie is definitely worth seeing if you're into story-
 This movie was sooooooo boring and confusing!! The only thing I can say is, it was a bad story line, bad acting, and bad camera work. The movie was about a man named Jim who was a master of the martial arts. He was captured by the government and forced to go into a military school. He was then indoctrinated with the military lifestyle. While at this school he meets a girl named Sally. After some time Jim and Sally get married. Jim and Sally start to have a child, which Jim gets to see a little bit of. As time goes on, Jim and Sally get more and more unhappy with the government because they are trying to turn people into soldiers. So they decide to leave the military school, but when they leave they find out that the government is still after them. Jim and Sally end up getting back together. I think that this was a pretty bad movie and I suggest that you don't watch it.

 I rented this movie because I enjoyed the first one, and the trailer looked kind of funny. I was hoping that it would be at least a little funny. Well, I was wrong. It was just a few funny scenes, and the rest of it was just plain boring. It was a waste of my time. I don't understand why anyone would rent this movie. It was just a very bad movie.

Buddy (Jason Biggs) is a teenager who lives in New York City. He has a crush on his best friend, Lisa (Kristen Bell). She goes with him to his favorite restaurant, and he takes her to meet his friends, where they all decide to head to a club. But when they get there, they notice some girls in nothing but underwear, and decide to go to their place. But Buddy's parents are away on a trip, so he's in charge of watching after his younger brothers, and he is not allowed to go out. So he decides to go to the club, with Lisa, and his friends. He meets a girl named Charlotte (Brittany Murphy), who is also a stripper at the club. Buddy and Charlotte hit it off
 A movie without a plot or any real interest. Guess it's 'cause it's a straight-to-video release, but even if it were a theatrical feature, it wouldn't be anything to write home about. The story doesn't even make sense. There's some conceit that a woman (Jennifer Love-Hewitt) is transporting some of her friends' body parts around in her car. She finds a road side bar (as if there is a road side bar in the middle of nowhere) in the middle of the desert, and the only people there are a pair of drunks. One of whom is a killer, the other a cop (who also happens to be a friend of hers). The killer kidnaps her, and she's held captive for two days. The killer has some kind of inflated ego about the number of victims he has taken (or killed). And the cop's just there because the killer's a friend of his. The killer thinks it's some kind of joke, and he's just as confused as the audience. The killer keeps telling her that he's 'just a clown,' and that he's just there to make her laugh. 'Cause he's a clown.<br /><br
 Let's face it, this film is a throw-away entry in the monster movie genre, and it's not much of one. The plot is of no consequence, the acting is mediocre, the special effects are unfinished, the gore is laughable, and the final battle is an anti-climax. I can't believe that this film is a cult classic.<br /><br />The film stars David Hess, who later gained fame as the lead singer of The Lemonheads. I've never heard of the Lemonheads, but I'm assuming that this is because their music is not as good as that of the Flaming Lips, who were the main reason I picked this film up in the first place. I am also assuming that these Lemonheads are not as good as the Flaming Lips. The main character is a washed-up rock star, and he is being chased out of town by an evil (and stupid) cult. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that the cult worships a giant semi-anthropomorphic slug which is a combination of an evil creature from the swamp and a giant pink teddy bear? That's a lot of stupidity for one film. Now we have a teddy bear with a
 I liked the characters, but the plot was weak and it was not believable. I didn't like the story line and found the film boring. I would not recommend it.

This movie started out bad, but it slowly got better. The story line is amazing! An incredible true survivor story. I loved it! It made me cry and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting is amazing!!! I loved it! The script is amazing! I gave it a 8 out of 10!

I was so excited to watch this movie because it was based on a true story. I was disappointed when it started. The story line was terrible and it was hard to understand. I liked the characters but I wasn't very interested in the story. I gave the movie a
 I have seen this movie and I have seen this show. I have read the book and I have read the books. I have read later adaptations and I have read the whole series. To me, the show is not as good as the book. The book is more intriguing and intriguing. It has the same characters, but their personalities are different, and that's why the book is more interesting. The book is more compelling. The movie, on the other hand, is not as good as the book. The book is more intriguing and compelling. The movie, on the other hand, doesn't have the same characters, and that's why the movie is not as good as the book. There are some things that are different, like the book has a lot of descriptive writing, but the movie doesn't anymore, which is a good thing. The book is more interesting because in the book, it's more mysterious and the movie is more interesting because it's more dramatic. I'm sure the movie will be better, but it's not. It's not as good as the book, but the movie has better acting than the book.

 I was expecting a laugh out loud hilarious movie, but I came out of the theater somewhat underwhelmed. I was expecting to laugh my head off, but the film was pretty tame. Overall, I was disappointed with the movie. The only thing that saved it was the fact that it was funny. A lot of the gags were just okay. Some of the punchlines were funny, but most of them fell flat. The movie just wasn't very funny. I think you could probably watch this movie 10 times and possibly not laugh once. The movie is also pretty long; it took me almost 3 hours to watch. I think it would have been better as an hour and a half and the movie would have been more enjoyable. I also felt like the movie was too predictable. I knew most of the punchlines and where they were going to come from. I think that this movie is for people who love the comedies that are more raunchy, like American Pie and Scary Movie. I don't think this movie is for those who want to see a good movie.

I think the actors in this movie were all great. The stand out performance was by Jim Carrey. I think that he was hilarious in this
 I was very excited to see this movie when it was released in the theaters. I had high hopes for it and I wanted to see it right away. The beginning of this movie was very promising. It was interesting and kept my attention. The only problem was that the movie was very slow. I was interested in what was going to happen next, but it was just so slow. I really didn't care about the characters. It was just a very dull movie and I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. It was very boring and I didn't care about anything that was happening. I was glad that I only paid $5 for a ticket. I couldn't believe I wasted a $5 on this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was not interesting at all. I hope this movie gets a lot of bad reviews so people will stop renting it.

I give it a 2 out of 10.

 I have always loved the 80's remake of "The Karate Kid" and this movie is the only one that I didn't like. The movie was boring and I was hoping for a good action movie but instead there were not enough fight scenes. I am so glad that I didn't pay to see this movie in the theater. I would not pay to see a movie that this one was. I actually was hoping to see a good action movie but instead the movie was boring.

I hope that the next movie that I see is better than this one. I thought that I wouldn't be disappointed but I was.

 I saw this movie for free at a friend's house. It was so bad that I've barely been able to stop thinking about it. The reason I'm writing this review is to warn people that it's not worth spending money on this film. If I had to give it a 1, I would. I give it a 0. My biggest problem was that they really didn't try to do anything creative with the film. I don't think that that is a problem with their budget, I just think that they were lazy. I watched this movie in the dark, and there was no attempt to do anything other than make a vampire movie. I was expecting there to be some kind of twist or twist ending, but there was nothing. A lot of people say that this movie is an anti-vampire movie. My understanding is that they are trying to show that vampires are not that scary, which I think is fairly well done. The real problem is that there are so many vampire movies out there that it's hard to make one stand out. The movie was not well written, and couldn't take itself seriously. I feel bad for the director, because I think that he had the idea for a good movie, but he just didn
 This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've seen so many terrible movies, but this was just awful. I mean the acting sucked. The plot was stupid. The whole thing was a waste of time. It's just not worth anyone's time. If you are a fan of the show, then you might get a kick out of this movie. If you're looking for a good comedy, then don't waste your time. This movie is not worth your time, and you will be sad you wasted it.

This movie is rated R for violence and profanity. There is a lot of violence and profanity.

There is a lot of violence in this movie, but it doesn't really bother me that much. I'm not offended by it. But it does make me feel like I shouldn't have watched it. The violence was pretty bad, but it wasn't that bad. The movie was rated R for a good reason.

There was a lot of profanity in this movie, but it wasn't too bad. It was pretty funny. There were several times where I laughed.

 I wanted to like this movie. It has a good premise, it really looks great, and I really wanted to support its story. But it just couldn't hold my interest. The ending was a little too neat and tidy for me. It was like the writers just accidentally wrote the ending for this movie and then just fixed it in editing. There's something about this movie that just makes it come across as contrived. The movie just seems like it's trying to be something more than it is. It's not bad, it's just more of the same. I liked the premise, but it just doesn't take you anywhere. It's a well made movie, I just can't get into it... I guess I didn't like the way they wrote the ending.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie, because it was written and directed by the man who brought us "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Devil's Rejects". But this movie just isn't that good. If you like movies like "Cabin Fever" and "Blair Witch" then this movie will be right up your alley. This movie is just more of the same.

So if you liked those movies, then you'll
 I don't think anybody can look at this movie without seeing it for what it is: a cheap cash-in on the success of the first movie. The acting is awful. The plot is really really simple. It's really really stupid. Nobody could take this movie seriously. The only good thing about this movie is the pictures of Stephen Baldwin as a gay guy. But even that isn't worth it.

Lol. I found this movie hilarious. It's a classic.

 I watched this movie and I thought it was going to be a comedy. It was not even close. It was a horror movie with a "comic" twist. I didn't laugh one time. I thought it was being done on purpose to get a laugh, but it was just the opposite. If you want a good laugh, rent "Gordy" instead. If you want to see an old-fashioned horror movie, see "The Terror." I don't know if the director watched many movies before making this one, but he must have watched a lot of comedies. What does he think "The Tingler" is? I thought it was going to be funny, but it wasn't. He also seemed to believe that trying to make a funny horror movie would be easy. It is not. It is hard to do. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.

 This is a film I have been waiting to see for a very long time. In fact, I've been waiting for it for so long I have almost forgotten about it. I saw the trailer, and it looked potentially good, but I didn't buy it. I was wrong.<br /><br />The film was actually even worse than I had remembered it. The opening scene was horribly disgusting, and the rest of the film was no better. The story is weak, the acting is horrible and the writing is laughable. The film also tries to be funny, but it fails miserably. The only good thing about the film is the cinematography, and that is not even enough to save it. I am seriously disappointed. It has taken me a long time to write this, because I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. I have seen the trailers for all of the films that have gotten bad reviews, and I thought that this one would be good. I was wrong. The only good thing about this film is that it is not very long. I would have been better off watching a film about a snail.

11/10 for originality

 One might wish to compare this movie to the great movies of the seventies; those which were so bad they were good. This movie is a good example of how bad a movie can be, and still be great. This movie is a comedy of errors. The screenplay is littered with lame gags and bad writing. The movie is funny in places, but in other places it is so painfully unfunny that you want to strangle the screen. As I said before, this is a comedy of errors. The plot is something that has been done a million times. The characters are so generic and uninteresting that you can hardly tell their names. The ending is the worst of all. This is the kind of movie that you watch and say, "Oh those guys make movies like this? I thought they made movies like 'The Godfather' or 'The Deer Hunter.' But I guess I was wrong." In the end, this movie is pretty good, but not great.

 The movie is already bad when they choose the title "Emperor" instead of "Emperor Meets the Predator", because there is no Predator in the movie at all (but only a Predator-like creature). The movie is total crap when you see the cast. I mostly remember the line "I hate you!" - which was said by the main character (played by the son of another actor). When you see the cast, you just can not believe it. They choose mostly unknown actors for this movie.

Also the story is so bad that it makes you laugh. If you want some good laughs, you should watch the movie "Taxi Driver", instead of watching this movie.

I want to thank the people who make my life so difficult.

They made me watch this movie.

 I'm a big fan of Alec Baldwin and his co-star in this film, but I was disappointed with this movie. The plot is a little weak, the acting is not great, and the scenes are not well-written. Baldwin's character and the way he acts is not consistent with his regular roles on 30 ROCK and in the New Yorker. I saw the movie in a theater on opening day and the audience seemed to laugh a lot at the in-jokes and at the actors' attempts to get the audience to laugh, but the jokes were not that funny. I watched the movie on Hulu for free and I rented it on VH1 so I was able to see it again. I think that the movie would have been better if it had been written by any one of the writers of Weekend at Bernie's, Scary Movie, and Meet the Parents. I gave the movie a 6 because it had a lot of stars and was directed by Debbie Myers.

 I was a big fan of Stallone's Rocky series. When I heard that he was making a movie version of Rambo, I knew I had to see it.<br /><br />I was so disappointed. I spent most of the movie in the theater shaking my head at how the movie was made. Rambo never said "Hey, you want a war?" He didn't say "How about a war?" He said "You want a war?" In fact, it seems to me that Rambo was a prisoner in the movie, not a fighter. He was a prisoner of John Rambo, not the other way around. The movie was so anti-American, I can't believe it was made here.<br /><br />The movie seemed to consist of a long, boring political speech and lots of "standing there" and "shooting people." The only thing that made the movie bearable was John Rambo's bravery. If any of you have seen the movie, you know the rest of the story.<br /><br />If Rambo ever did say "Hey, you want a war?" he did a lousy job of it.

 I've only watched the first episode of this series and I'm not impressed. It's obvious why it was canceled.<br /><br />The main problem with the show seemed to be that it was supposed to be a "comedy" but it didn't have any humor and was pretty much just a non-stop chase scene with a few bland jokes thrown in.<br /><br />The writing was so bad that I actually found myself cringing at some of the dialogue that was used. The characters were to one dimensional and the dialogue didn't help much either.<br /><br />The animation was pretty good, but the characters' designs seemed too simple. There were a few funny moments, but mainly it was just a non-stop chase scene with a few non-descript shots thrown in.<br /><br />This show just didn't do anything for me. I'm a fan of the 70s TV show Get Smart, but it was still funny, and even though I'm not an animation fan, I can tell you that the animation in that show was a lot better than what was used in this show.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

 The story is set in Roman times, when Caesar Augustus came to power. He is an old man and the only child of his wife, the Empress Livia. She dies shortly after giving birth to a son, to whom Caesar will not show the same love as his wife. He will only show him the love he should have. He says he is a god, but in reality he is a human animal, brutal and selfish, as we can see on this film.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of his adopted son, Drusus (played by Arno Lindt), Caesar's grandson. The film was made in 1971, but the story is set in the 1st century BC. The movie is not a story about the end of the Roman Empire, but about the beginning of the Roman Empire. It is the story of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. The main character is Caesar Augustus, who will be the first to unite the Roman Empire. The story is about the beginning of the Empire, when the Romans are just starting to conquer the world, and about the beginning of the end of the Empire, when the Empire is already looted and the last of the Roman emperors, who will
 This movie is a waste of time. I thought the first one was worse, but this one took the cake. The acting was putrid, the plot was just a mess, and the movie was so ridiculous I would have been embarrassed to show it to my grandmother. The storyline was so bad that even a seven year old could have done a better job. If you want to see this movie then rent it. The DVD is a lot better than the movie.<br /><br />Give it a one if you want to be a jerk.

A good movie with a bad ending Author: Luchadorn from United States

7 August 2003 This movie is a good movie. I think that the bad ending is something that happens to many films.

 I should not have bothered watching this movie! The plot was a thin one and the acting was bad. The only good thing about this movie was the beautiful location and the wonderful actors playing the parts of the individuals who were killed in the movie. The director could have mentioned it in the credits but did not. Mr. DeSantis as the director should have known that the audience would not care about the director, who in my opinion is far better than the actors in this movie. The movie was on TV consistently, therefore I probably should have ignored the commercials and watched the show instead.

I was not impressed with this movie and had to turn it off. I could not sit through it and only watched it because it was on TV. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

This is a true story and you should see the movie to find out the details of this horrible event. The movie has a good storyline and a good story line. It is based on the true story of a man who was killed by his wife during an argument on a camping trip. The movie shows how much a man loves his wife but at the same time how much pain she can cause him.


 I watched this movie not only to see the amazing performance of Rene Russo, but also because I heard about the film from a friend. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The movie is about a woman's battle with breast cancer, and it does a wonderful job of portraying the importance of breast cancer awareness in the early 2000s. Unfortunately, the film focuses too much on the personal life of Russo's character and does not offer enough on the medical aspect of breast cancer. The movie is also too long and the ending seems to come out of nowhere. However, the film does offer an amazing performance by Ms. Russo and is a decent movie overall.

3.5 out of 10 - The acting was great, but the movie as a whole was not.

I loved her performance as a TV reporter. I also really enjoyed the way this movie showed a first hand look at breast cancer. I usually don't care for this type of movie because I really hate seeing people's lives turned upside down because of a disease. However, I felt that this movie did a good job in showing how a person can handle the illness. Another thing that I thought was amazing was how this movie didn't
 I have to admit that I hate horror movies that show one of the characters caught in the trap and then they all die. It's such a cop out. If you are going to do it, at least show the character that is in the trap die. I am so sick of that technique. It's so predictable and it's so cheap. This movie had a few good scares, but for the most part it was a big disappointment. I was hoping for a little more from this movie.

 Maybe it's because I was in a movie theatre when I watched it, but I really hated this movie. It's a really stupid, pointless movie with really bad acting and a really bad script. I mean, the whole thing is just stupid and pointless, why is he hanging around for the whole movie, why did she even leave him in the first place, what's going on in that town, why was he in the first place... it's just a really bad movie. Sorry, guys, but I just didn't like this one. It's not even worth renting because it's just a bad film.

 I was expecting a lot more from this movie after reading the reviews. I am so annoyed that I spent my money on something that is so stupid. It could have been made for a quarter of the price. The acting is horrible and the plot is too predictable. And to think I wasted money on this thing. I would not recommend it to anyone. I wish I never saw it. I will never see another movie from this company again. I will only buy movies that are made by companies that have a name and reputation, such as Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.

It has one redeeming quality. The cinematography is beautiful.

I am a person who makes an effort to support local businesses and I thought this movie would be made by a local company. I was wrong.

I would rather watch a dog chase a car than watch this movie. I would rather watch one of those reality shows on MTV. I really should have read the reviews first. I thought this movie would be good, after all it was written and directed by Hollywood's new darling, Robert Altman. Robert Altman is famous for directing a movie that has never been released. I can't believe I wasted my time. I wonder what happened
 I have to say, I never thought I would see the day where I would write a negative review for a Jude Law movie, but here we are. This was a time wasting, pointless waste of time. Jude shows that he is a fine actor when he is in a good movie. I can't think of a single movie he has done where he has truly been good. For example, "The Talented Mr. Ripley", "Evita", and "The Holiday", to name a few. But, unfortunately, he has done some terrible movies. Which brings me to this movie. In this movie, he plays an American who gets in trouble in Italy by stealing something. He then gets set up in jail and must so some time in jail to pay off his debt and save his sister. So his plan is to be in jail and get out. That's it. The rest of the movie consists of him in jail trying to get out. The movie keeps repeating this every time Jude is in jail. And, for the record, when Jude is in jail, his best friend is a guy named Tony (Nick Moran). Tony is in jail for killing someone. The rest of the movie is Jude and Tony trying to find a
 Really, how can you make a movie like this? It's just plain boring. The acting is terrible, the story is unintelligible and the ending is completely ridiculous. I'd rather watch Nickelodeon. Seriously, you people. This is just plain awful. You'd think that with all the money that has been spent on this movie, that it could have been at least a little bit good. It's like a remake of "The Wizard of Oz". Only worse. I hope that you have a fun time watching this movie. It's just plain awful.

<br /><br />This movie has a great cast, but the acting is so atrocious, that it really doesn't matter. I think that the first half of the movie is the worst. I'm not sure why, but the acting just doesn't seem to be that good. It's not that they're acting bad, they're just acting horribly. I guess I'll give them credit for trying. It's just such a boring movie. I think that they could have done a lot more with the story. I'm not saying that it's not a good one, but they could have done a lot more with it. The story is just
 The first half of the movie is the best part, but then things just spiral downhill. Picture yourself watching a bad horror movie, and you'll know what to expect. The only thing different here is that the people who made the movie are really, really, really bad at it. The acting is irritating, the effects are bad and laughable, and the script is painful to watch. This movie is a train wreck.

A very well-made movie, with a surprisingly good plot. It's very well-acted, especially by the main character, who is a total jerk. The movie is also very funny, and has a nice touch of humor. All in all, a great movie.

I was shocked by this movie. What kind of film is so bad it makes me want to write a review? It's a very good horror movie, and it's only the fact that it's so bad that makes it a horror. I mean, it's just so bad. The acting is terrible, the acting is bad. The effects are bad
 I believe that if this was to be a film, it would have been a 10/10. I would have seen it in the theater and paid full price. I would have gone to the effort to go the effort to go to the effort to go the effort. However, the DVD is a 5/10. <br /><br />I would have to say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It has a lot of bad directing and acting. There are scenes in the film that should have been edited out as they are useless and add no additional value to the film. <br /><br />The sound was also bad. There were a few times where I did not know what was being said. It is a shame because there could have been some good acting if the sound had been better. <br /><br />The story line was very bad. It was a very weak point in the film. The acting was only average at best. <br /><br />The "twist" was not very good. I felt that it was obvious that the lead was not a ghost and that it was just a story line to keep the viewer entertained. <br /><br />Overall
 Well, I'm sure they tried hard to make a good movie here. But lets face it, this is a teen horror movie. And since I'm sure the folks at New Line Cinema tried hard to make a good movie, it's a bit of a let-down. You see, it's a teen horror movie and not a good one. The plot is weak, the acting is weak and the special effects are weak. If you're a fan of the genre, then you might like this movie. But if you're just a movie fan, stay away.

As a side note, how many times have we seen a movie where a bunch of kids are hanging out in a cabin in the woods, and one of them gets accidentally killed by a giant snake, and the only thing anyone knows is that the snake was a python, and that the snake had the ability to change its skin color to match its surroundings? Do we really have to see another movie like that? Does anyone?

I'd give this movie a 3 out of 10.

 Oh, you've heard about this? Have you? You have? Well, I'm going to tell you the truth of this movie. I was a little kid during the 1930's when I first saw this movie. I must have been about 10 or 11 years old. I can't remember the title of the movie at all. I just remember it was a black and white movie. I remember that my mother took me to see it at a theater in the Bronx. I remember that my mother took me to see it with my aunt, who had a son just my age. That was how I knew the movie was a black and white movie. I remember that the movie was very sad. A lot of people died. I remember that the movie was very scary. But I never knew that the movie was part of a series, but I don't remember what the title of it was either. I don't think anyone knew it was part of a series. I only knew it was a black and white movie. I remember that I didn't like the movie. I think that because I was probably too young for it. I don't think that I would like it now. I remember that when I was a kid I thought that the
 This film is a very poor effort. The acting is atrocious. The plot is very weak. The special effects are horrible. The story is stupid, and the dialog is cheesy. The only thing I liked about this movie is the fact that it was only 45 minutes long. The ending was very predictable and very lame. I would strongly urge everyone to stay away from this movie.

 This is a terrible story, with weak actors and a plot that is, well, rather boring. The script and direction are pretty bad, and the whole thing looks like it was filmed in a barn with a low budget. While watching this it felt to me that the director and actors were trying to think of something clever to put in their script, but the real talent was in their ability to avoid saying anything at all. (I mean, come on. The director just leaves a character in the middle of nowhere and then shoots a scene as if nothing had happened. While I'm sure it would have been more interesting and a lot less confusing if they had actually had a reason for this, I think it would have been more interesting if they had had a reason for that.) There are a few moments of unintentional comedy, but they are few and far between, and the story itself is rather dull. The characters are pretty one dimensional, and the actors are not that good. The story is not so bad that I didn't finish it, but I probably would have stopped watching if it hadn't been for the fact that I had paid for it. I also found it very difficult to concentrate on the dialogue, because I found it to be so

 This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. It is a film where the director simply does not have an idea of what to do. The only good thing about this movie is the location. It is a beautiful place which is unfortunately used as wallpaper in this movie. The story is drawn out and predictable, the characters are mostly one dimensional, and the ending is so lame that it makes you wonder if the director is trying to be original. The whole movie is unnecessary. I would recommend seeing the movie if you are a fan of the director, but if you are looking for a good movie, I would look elsewhere.<br /><br />*SPOILER* (view spoiler)

 I watched this movie and I thought it was a waste of my time. It's a shocker that it was nominated for an oscar. It's just a gimmick. The one thing I didn't understand is how a movie with such bad acting and directing could be nominated for an Oscar. I just don't get it.

 the car chase was pretty fun.

Now this is a shocker - the car chase was pretty fun. The problem is that the rest of the movie is pretty bad. And the part that is supposed to be scary is just plain stupid. It's just not scary. I mean, come on. It's a horror movie but instead of being scary it's just a stupid teen movie. This movie has a lot of potential but it fails.

 this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

 I have to admit I was disappointed in this film. I thought the concept was interesting, even if the result was less than intriguing. The film is a kind of a documentary. Cusack plays a journalist who is researching a small town conspiracy. He gets a bunch of people together to talk about what went on that night. The talk is all over the place, but it does give the viewer a glimpse into the lives of these people. The trouble is the film doesn't really work because it is a very superficial view of the situation. The people are all from the same town, so that makes it all too easy to explain away their own actions. It also doesn't really explain why Cusack is so interested in the case, or what he is looking for. The whole thing is very ambiguous. It's hard to explain the why of it all. I think it's very unfair to judge this film in comparison to the great films made in the late 80s. This is a very different kind of film and I think that's the reason it doesn't work. I think it's interesting enough and the acting is good, but it's definitely a film that should be seen.

I give it a 6 out of 10
 This movie was an absolute disaster. I liked it when it was first released, but now that I've seen it for the fifth time I can say with complete confidence that it was a waste of money. Sure, the acting was good, but the story is atrocious. The main character is a complete jerk, and the movie doesn't really have much of a plot. Sure, there are a few funny moments, but nothing really to speak of. The only good thing about the movie is the guy that plays the lead role. He is a great actor and does a great job. The rest of the cast is very good as well, so if you're a fan of the actors, give it a try. But if you're a true fan of the movie, steer clear.<br /><br />1/10

I hate to say it, but this movie is not good. It's a funny movie, but the story is weak, the characters are annoying, and the acting is not good. I am so dissapointed. I saw it the first time in a theater with a friend of mine, and he was into it.
 This film is a horrible mess of a film. The acting is horrible, the story is horrible, the direction is horrible, the editing is horrible and the music is horrible. The only thing the film is good for is being a great example of what NOT to do when making a film. This film is so bad that I actually liked the scene where the guy is getting the hard-on. This film is so bad that I think I should have to pay for it. I cannot believe that this film could have been made with a budget of $1 million. It is actually cheaper to watch "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" on DVD.

This film is so bad that I spent more time reviewing the DVD than actually watching the film. If you want to watch something so bad that you can't help but love it, I recommend watching "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" or "Teen Wolf Party Massacre II".

I would rather watch "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" or "Teen Wolf Party Massacre II" on DVD than this film on DVD.

If you want to see a good horror film, rent "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "The Evil Dead". Both films are funny, have good acting and have
 This movie is awful. The acting is wooden, a bit wooden, and completely unrealistic. The characters are not likeable. The story is boring and the writing is awful. It is a very bad movie and I am surprised that it had a such a good score on IMDb.

 I was really excited to see the new movie from the incomparable Spike Lee, but it was a major disappointment. The film is about three young men on the verge of manhood; one of them is the son of a pimp, another is a young black man from the projects, and the third is a white kid from the suburbs. The movie takes place in New York City, and all three of the main characters are from Brooklyn, so it could be said that the movie is about the neighborhood that Lee comes from. The story is about these three young men that meet in an elevator, and all three of them have a dream of becoming rappers. The movie tries to be realistic, but in the end, the story is a little to preachy and the message of the movie becomes a little too obvious. But the worst part of the movie is the acting. The three young men are good, but they are not very convincing. The main character, played by Marlon Wayans, is an actor that has been around for a while. He is a talented comedian and has been in some good movies. He has a very good screen presence and he is very likable. But I think he was miscast in this movie. He
 I would have given this movie one star, but it was not quite that bad. It certainly did not deserve a three star rating. I took this movie with me to a special screening of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, and most of the audience laughed at the scenes with the "Hogwarts cheerleaders". I thought this movie was very poorly done. It was the first movie that I have seen that has ever done "Hogwarts cheerleaders" so poorly. They were not very attractive and did not do any dancing at all. I do not understand why someone would think that a cheerleader would be attractive. The whole movie was very cheesy, and I did not think it was funny at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

I thought the movie was a waste of time.

 I have seen this movie numerous times and keep buying it from Blockbuster Video. It is absolutely awesome! The guy who plays the character of Dorko is awesome. It is about a guy who gets a super computer for his birthday and is able to download into his brain. It is not a bad movie at all. It is a great movie to watch when you are bored and don't have anything to watch. I have been able to watch this movie over and over again and I will always buy it from Blockbuster on DVD. I have even rented it a couple of times. It is a movie you don't want to miss. It is definitely the best movie I have ever seen. It is great, by far the best movie I have seen in my life.

 I am a big fan of this show, and I was excited to see the last few episodes. Unfortunately the last few episodes were some of the worst the show has had in its entire run. The show's formula has always been to have a character that is bad and then to put them in a situation where they have to be good. The problem this season is that the show's writers and director seem to have lost track of what made the show good and what made it bad. I've never been a fan of the voiceover, but it is used on this show more than any other show I have ever seen. The voiceover is used as a crutch to get the audience to connect with the bad character, which I think is wrong. There is a very specific pattern to how a character goes from bad to good, and the writers should know that. The writers need to quit writing the stories to fit the bad characters to fit the good characters, and this is the biggest problem of this season. The writers seem to have forgotten what made the show good the first time around. The show has always had a very black and white view on the characters and their actions. The writers have forgotten what made the characters good and have made the
 What a terrible film. There are a lot of bad movies out there but this one is in a league of its own. What a disgrace that a movie maker could make so much money out of a film that is so bad. What a waste of good actors, production, script and cameraman. This film is so bad that it is painful to watch. The scenes are so badly edited, shot and acted that it leaves the audience with no desire whatsoever to see the stupid film again. The suspension of disbelief is completely smashed to pieces. The film is so bad that I don't even have to try and actually make any sense of it, the incoherence of the film is so obvious that it actually makes me laugh. I will not go on to explain why this is a terrible film, as there is a load of info on the net about its awfulness. I can only hope that the makers of this film burn in hell for eternity for their idiotic film making.

I would give it one star, but that would mean that I had to make a rating, which is not an option.

I would give it zero or two stars if that was possible, but that would mean that I had to make one of those
 This is a very poor film.<br /><br />Basically it is a poor remake of "The Thing From Another World".<br /><br />The film makers had the good idea of using an actual meteorite from Mars as a prop. Instead of just using the meteorite, however, they have built an entire set of 3D space ships and a space station.<br /><br />The special effects are dire.<br /><br />The acting is poor (how many times can you hear the word "dumb"?)<br /><br />The film makers use the "dumb" character as a plot device. This character is so stupid that you don't believe he could possibly survive on a space station. You feel sorry for the character.<br /><br />The film makers make the good idea of using an actual meteorite from Mars but they don't even make good use of the idea.<br /><br />The other characters are just as stupid.<br /><br />This is not a good film. It is not even a good remake of a good film. This is a poor film.

 This movie does not deserve any praise at all. It is boring and has no plot. The acting is really bad and the dialogs are boring. I didn't even finish watching this film.

I would give this movie a zero, but i am not allowed to do that. This movie is so bad that i can't give it a zero.

So there are no good comments to make on the movie.

I give this movie a 0/10

P.S. I am not the only one who thinks it is bad. I saw it with at least 4 other people and they all agreed with me.

P.P.S. Watch the movie yourself and you will see that i am not lying.

 This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad that I had to skip the first ten minutes, because I didn't have the patience to sit through it. It's hard to understand why it is getting such good reviews. It's the worst comedy I have ever seen. I hope there is no sequel. It was so bad that I don't think I can watch it again. The only movie I have ever seen that was worse than this was "Mystery Men". It was so bad that I went to the website to write a review, and I couldn't even do that. It was so bad that I decided to write a review of the worst movie I have ever seen. I am sure that "Mystery Men" was a better movie than "Worst Case Scenario", but it was so bad that I can't even remember it. I can't believe that it is getting so many good reviews. I wanted to see it so bad, but I couldn't stand to watch the first ten minutes. I couldn't make it through the whole movie. It is so bad that I decided to write a review to make fun of it. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad
 I have to disagree with every single one of the previous comments. I don't mind a bad movie so much as I mind bad writing. I was so bored while watching this movie I was actually rooting for the characters to die. I'm a huge fan of the B horror genre and have seen some of the best and worst of the genre. I think this movie is the worst ever. I have seen many movies that were so bad that they were hilarious. This movie was not one of them. The acting was the worst ever. The story was so predictable. I cant believe how many people on this site absolutely love this movie. I am a big fan of Tobe Hooper and I can tell you that this is not a Tobe Hooper movie. It is a Wes Craven movie. I guess we can't all be right. The other thing about this movie is that it is just not scary. The only thing this movie is good for is a good laugh.

 I just watched this movie for the first time, and I'm suffering from a severe case of "The Movie's Not So Bad, It's Just That..." disease. The plot is great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great. The only problem I have with the movie is the ending. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I think the ending is a little too...alive. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a great ending, but it's still a little bit too...alive.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of movies that have a really really really good ending, and then a really really really bad one. See "The Day After Tomorrow". If you don't get that reference, I'm really really really sorry. <br /><br />The movie's still really really really good, though. I just wish the ending had been a little more like a movie.

 This is a very confusing movie. It has a lot of different story lines that all come together to create a very confusing plot. The acting was pretty good. I was very disappointed in the movie because it seemed like the movie makers did not have a plan. I feel like they just made the movie because they didn't have any other ideas. The only thing I liked about this film was the unreal runway. The film as a whole was very poorly done.

The story line of this movie was very confusing. I found it very hard to follow.

The acting in this movie was very good. I saw this film on television and I really enjoyed it. The only thing that really bothered me was the fact that it was made in the 80's. I believe this film would have been better if it was made in the 2000's.

All in all, I feel like I wasted my time watching this film. This was a very disappointing film. I feel like the story line was very weak and the acting wasn't that good.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

The film starts off with a girl that is very pretty. I really liked her hair. She gets kidnapped and she is being
 This was the WORST movie I've ever seen. I don't think I could have made a better movie myself. There are certain movies that one is just not supposed to see, but this is one of them. I guess it was a way for the director to get his name out there so he could make the movie he wanted to make. I'm guessing the screenplay wasn't his idea, but the director was the one who got the job. The acting was horrible. The plot was awful. The film was just a mess. It was a show, not a movie. I can't believe it got made. This should have been a BETTER movie than it was. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

 I saw this movie 'on the bus'. I'm not sure who saw it first. It was a Monday morning and we were all on the bus. I was the first to see it and I knew I had to get the DVD. <br /><br />I love all the Big Fish movies. They are so great at making you believe in the characters and the situations and they are very well put together. <br /><br />I had to see this one. As I started watching it the feeling of being on the bus and almost being able to hear the people around me just being quiet and watching the movie. It was an awesome feeling. I have to say I was a little surprised by the movie. I was expecting something very interesting and I got something that wasn't. It was a very good movie, but at the same time it wasn't. It was not a bad movie, but it wasn't a good movie either. It was a movie that was pretty good and there was just something missing. I think that as they say in movies, it seemed to just be missing the 'something'. <br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who really likes the movies. It was a good movie
 I was expecting a lot from this movie, but I couldn't even finish it. It was that bad. The movie was trying to be different, but just didn't work. I've seen many a movie where the main character is a little boy, but that's not the reason I didn't like this movie. I thought the characters were flat and the actors were not believable. Also the movie was not well written. I was hoping that this movie would be a great family movie, but it was just not.<br /><br />I think the movie is aimed at children, but it was just not good enough to be played to children. The kids would have been bored.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

(spoiler) The ending is the worst part. The ending is the part of the movie where you feel like you are watching a movie that was made by someone who knew nothing about movies and just copied a movie they saw somewhere else. I have not seen a movie like that before. It was just a bad ending, and it ruined the movie.

(spoiler) The "bad guys" were not funny. They were just not funny. Also I found them
 I was looking forward to seeing this film because I am a huge fan of the musical and I thought that this was a film that would be a great one to bring to the big screen. Unfortunately, it is not. There is no plot. It is just a collection of songs, much like a musical. The only thing that makes it slightly different is the fact that the songs are lip-synched and that it is a comedy. But the songs are not funny or funny enough to sustain a comedy. There are a few funny moments, but that is about it. The only thing that keeps this film afloat are the songs. I would suggest that if you want to see a good musical, see "The Fantasticks". That is a really well done show and if you want a great comedy, see "Spinal Tap", "Caddyshack" or "Silent Movie".

 I think a little worse than this movie, I've seen a lot worse, I hope. This movie is very slow, very boring and even full of clichés. It's a movie which has a lot of time, but it doesn't do anything. It's only the usual crime movie, which is so common that it doesn't really matter, but this time it's even worse, because it's just not funny at all. I don't want to give any spoilers, but after all I'm sorry to say that I didn't laugh once during the movie. It's a stupid movie, with a stupid story and a stupid ending. I think it has a lot of potential, but it's just not the case. I think it's only for those who like to know how a crime movie usually is.

I would give this movie a 2, but instead I give it a 1, because it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely one of the worst. I guess I'll watch the sequel, but I'm not sure if I'll like it. I don't really like the stories of this kind.

 I was really looking forward to this film but I was really disappointed. I have been re-watching the first 2 films and I really like them, but this film is... just boring. I have even watched this film with the sub-titles and it was even worse. I'm a big fan of all the films, but this one is not that great. I started watching the film but I was already too bored to finish it, and I don't think I will ever watch it again. I would recommend the first 2 films over this one, they are really great.

I really wanted to see this film after the last one, but I really was disappointed. I really like the first 2 films, I think they are really good, but this film just wasn't good. I think the script was really boring, and I don't like the way the film was made. I thought the first film was a lot better. I like the first film a lot better, to be honest. I hope the next film will be as good as the first two. I am really looking forward to the next one. I know that the next film will be better because I
 This movie just can't decide if it's a dead-serious drama or a parody of the same. It's neither. The plot is almost comical in it's absurdity, and the acting is a little better than the plot.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a disclaimer about how realistic it is, and how much it has been influenced by reality, and how it is, in fact, a documentary.<br /><br />Well, the "documentary" half starts out with a couple of people walking around the streets of Chicago, talking about how they wish they could be in an action movie, like "Die Hard" or "The Matrix" or "Twelve Monkeys" or...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />So, they find a movie set, and start to change things around. Then, they get a call from a movie producer, saying that he wants to see the movie they are making. So they go to the set, and meet the producer, and the movie starts. Well, that's basically the plot, and it's pretty much what you expect. They get involved in the movie, and most of the plot is made up by the first half of the
 The "B" movie from this year is the mess that is "Ticker". The acting is so bad it will make you feel as if you are watching "The Last Horror Film". The special effects are good, but the story line is so bad it will make you want to puke. The ending is so bad it will make you want to puke. I give it a 1 out of 10

 About the only thing I can say about this movie is that it was filmed in the right order. The movie starts out with the characters of the "E" team and the "H" team. These two teams are the most incompetent in the business. The director makes no effort to develop the story line. It is all cut and dried. The "E" team goes to a hotel to catch a serial killer who is killing women. They catch him, but he turns out to be a woman! The "H" team goes to a warehouse to stop a terrorist who is trying to blow up a train. They stop him but he turns out to be a woman! The "E" team goes to a park to catch a serial killer who is killing women. They catch him, but he turns out to be a woman! The "H" team goes to a warehouse to stop a terrorist who is trying to blow up a train. They stop him, but he turns out to be a woman! And the list goes on and on. That is the main story line. There are many sub stories and they are all wrapped up by the end of the movie. The movie is a complete waste of time and money. I would rather watch
 I saw this movie a few months ago. I really enjoyed it. Now I can't even remember what it was about. The plot was like watching a train wreck. And the acting was terrible. This was a really bad movie. Don't waste your time.

 A high school is held hostage by a group of people who are obviously disturbed or mentally ill. The school's employees learn that the group has been planning this attack for months, and in order to disarm the group, and to save everyone, the employees have to undergo a day-long psychological and physical survival test. If a certain number of employees survive, then the school is saved; if the school is saved, the employees will be allowed to leave the school. In the meantime, the school's security guards learn that the group leader is a former student of their school, who was expelled for setting a fire in the school's hallway. The security guards must find out who the leader is and why he set the fire.<br /><br />This movie is just plain awful. There is no suspense at all. There is no tension.

The movie is actually made worse by the fact that Dobbs plays a character who is so unlikeable, that once you learn who he is,
 I watched this film for a film class. I found it to be an extremely boring film. If a film can be boring, this film is boring. And it is an absolutely terrible film. It is a film that is so slow and boring that it is difficult to sit through. I think the writer of this film needs to learn how to write a story or how to write or how to write better. And if this is supposed to be a comedy, then it is not very funny. There is nothing funny about it at all. No one will enjoy watching this film. It is not funny, it is not interesting, and it is not exciting. It is just boring. I don't recommend that anyone watch it at all. I think this film is a waste of time.

This film is about a girl named Beth who is a very nice girl. She starts to have nightmares about a monster. She thinks that the monster is her father who was an abusive alcoholic. She was sent away from home to live with her aunt and uncle. Beth is a very nice girl. She is very kind and does not have many friends. She
 "The Godfather" is a masterpiece and perhaps the greatest film in cinematic history, but I have to say that this remake is a loser. It has been directed by a young director who had only directed one film before; he had no idea what he was doing and had no concept of how to do a good job. He had a terrible cast, with the only good performance being by John Cazale as the young Don Corleone. The whole film is about a gangster family and how they live, and this is a very important part of the story, but the director completely misjudged this. The film is just not interesting, and the whole thing is dragged out and dull, and the performances are all terrible.<br /><br />The only thing that I liked about the movie was the cinematography. The cinematography is excellent, and the movie looks superb. The film has many great scenes (with only one truly bad one) and the cinematography is just a major reason why the film is worth seeing. I would recommend this movie, but I would not recommend it as a very good film.

 I see what you are saying about the film and I agree with you. I also believe that most of you are "thinking" about the film as a film and not as a film that should be studied in film schools, or taught in film schools. I have seen the film and I have read the book and unlike what I have seen and read, I have noticed that the film was very close to the book. I do not know if this has to do with the fact that the book was written by a woman, or if it has to do with the fact that this film was directed by a woman. In any case, I think that if you are going to make a film based on a book, you should be close enough to the book to be able to understand what the author is trying to say. I am sure that the author would be very happy to know how this film was made and how it came out.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am the kind of person who likes to watch films in a very different way. I do not like to read the book and then make notes of what I have read and then make a film based on my notes. I believe that film students should be forced to
 This film is a spoof of the classic "It's a Wonderful Life." Yet, it is so horrible, I couldn't even laugh at it. It's a very long film with a lot of special effects and acting. It's a very bad film with no laughs. It's a shame. I suppose that it took a long time to make, because it showed in a small theatre.

I suggest you rent the classic "It's a Wonderful Life" instead of this one. This one is just plain bad.

 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean, really bad. It was so bad that it was a waste of time and money seeing it. I saw it on a cable channel and the movie was so bad that I couldn't bring myself to just turn the channel. The plot seemed to be about a guy with a weird name who was in trouble with the law so he started a comic book. He created some cool comic book characters, but then he was in trouble and the cops came after him. There was some good action, but that's it. It was so bad that I couldn't even laugh at the jokes. I mean, really bad. I wouldn't even give this movie a 1. If I could give it negative stars I would. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I bet it will soon be on video tape. Don't waste your time and money! I don't know what this movie was, but I think that the people who made it must have been on drugs. I like a lot of movies, but this is just terrible. Don't see it!

Score: 1 out of 10 (If I could give it negative stars I would)

 I saw this film in the theater in the 80's with my father. I remember thinking it was one of the most stupid movies I had ever seen. I just wanted to get home and take a shower. It was a very bad movie. It was just dumb. The story was very bad and the acting was terrible. The one thing I remember most is when a tourist was attacked by zombies and we were supposed to be scared of the monsters but the actress was scared of the zombies. She was just a real bad actress. She was just one of the worst in the world. This movie is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was just awful. I also remember a few of the other actors in the film. I remember the lady with the glasses. She was just a bad actress. The main actress with the blonde hair was also a bad actress. I remember one of the most famous actors in this film. He was the guy that was in the film with the bad head. It was a bad movie. It was just a bad, bad movie. I can't believe how this movie is so high on the IMDb. I remember seeing a lot of really bad movies on the IMDb in the 80's
 It's a shame we make films like this. It's so incredibly stupid, it's unreal. It's a bit like a joke that went horribly wrong. The acting is terrible, the script is terrible, the whole thing is terrible. The actors are trying to portray emotion and the script gives them no idea what to do with it. And the whole thing is set in the era of the early nineties. The actress who plays the heroine looks about 16, and the actor doing the sweet, white boy role looks about 20. It's so incredibly stupid, and just so incredibly awful. I hope they lose all their money on this movie. It was a complete waste of time, and a complete waste of money. If you are thinking of seeing this film, don't. Just don't. Don't waste your time. I hope they lose all their money.

 From the movie "Enemy of the State" in 1997, the story is about a secret NSA computer that no one is allowed to know. In the movie, when the computer is hacked by some bad guys, they get proof that they have the proof (ie. the virus) that the NSA has been illegally collecting information from every phone and computer in the US. They use this proof to blackmail the NSA into giving them the software to the computer which protects the computer so that no one can hack it. The bad guys also get the proof of a murder out of the computer, and blackmail the NSA into running the murder investigation for them. In the movie, the only identity of the NSA is the "Agent Smith" character. At the end of the movie, the bad guys have the software and the murder investigation. While the movie is good and fun - the computer has nothing to do with how the movie ends. In the movie, the computer is destroyed and the bad guys have nothing. In the movie, the computer's software is useless without the virus. In the movie, the computer has nothing to do with the murder investigation. Also, the computer has nothing to do with the murder investigation in the movie. In reality, the computer
 This is just a piece of garbage. I am a big fan of silent movies and this is the worst of them all. The story is dull and the acting is awful. The only thing that makes this movie watchable is the eerie music and the beautiful historical backgrounds. It is a shame that it is so bad, because the visuals are quite amazing. I would not recommend anyone to see this. The only reason I am giving it a 1 instead of a 0 is because it is not completely devoid of entertainment. If you are a fan of silent movies, you will find this piece of crap very entertaining.

The Perfect Woman

20 July 2006 - 2 out of 3 users found this review helpful.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is absolutely boring and the story is almost non-existent. It is about a man who is obsessed with a female character in a book he is writing and constantly thinks about her. Her name is Emily, and she is played by a really hot and talented actress. She does not do much in the movie and is basically just walking around looking beautiful or talking to someone or doing some other activity
 Having seen all of the 'Scream' movies, I was expecting a lot more from this one; I thought for sure it would be a lot better than the other ones. I was very disappointed. The movie was too many cliché's and not scary at all. I was very disappointed in the acting by Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. I thought they were very average. I was very disappointed in the sound track. I thought for sure that the sound track would be one of the best parts of the movie, but the songs really didn't fit with the movie. If you are looking for a good scary movie then this isn't it.

P.S. I thought this movie was awful.

 Not since the end of the first Buffalo Bill film has a director been so utterly lost as this one. Having to make the sequel to a successful movie is always a difficult task, but this one is especially so. The first film was a quiet, intimate story with a cast that was made up of good actors and a nice blend of horror and humor. This one was loud and full of slapstick humor that had no place in the first film. The film starts out with a nice intro, but never returns to it. Instead, we get a series of scenes that are not related to the first film and in some cases do not make sense in relation to the story line. And in every single scene, there is a reference to the fact that this is a sequel. It is just not done well.

The biggest mistake was in the casting of the film. For the first film, the cast was made up of actors who could carry a film on their own. In this one, they are trying to cram the entire cast into these roles. It doesn't work. The movie is full of other problems, but the casting is probably the worst.

The second biggest mistake is the change of the main character. The first film
 A lot of people have said this movie is hilarious, but I found it boring. I actually went to a showing of this movie and the audience was laughing, but I was not. I watched this movie because I heard it was hilarious and had a good cast. The story is about a group of people who go to a hotel in Australia to find someone who can perform a certain surgery that will help them make a lot of money. But, the story is really boring and nothing really happens. Also, it's not really that funny. I don't know if you have to be a fan of one of the actors or the director to enjoy this movie, but that's what I think. If you haven't seen this movie, I would definitely give it a miss.

 I have to admit i was very depressed to see that this was being made, i live in the UK and saw the trailer before it was released, i was so depressed there was no way i could watch it, and i only watched it so i could give my opinion on this film. i wish i hadn't i watched it and it was so dull i had to watch it all the way through before i started writing my review, i didn't even finish the film, and i even have a good taste in films, films like "The Breakfast Club" and "Sixteen and Pregnant" are two of my favourite films. but this film was so boring, i even put my phone down, i was so bored i couldn't even write a proper review, i just wanted to be done with the film, and i had to watch it again so i could be done with it and not have to watch it again, i swear this film is a load of rubbish, i don't want to watch it again, i don't care if it's on TV again, it's more enjoyable to watch paint dry than this rubbish, i hope no one else watches this, i hope no one buys this, i hope it gets pulled off

 This was a waste of time. I had wanted to see this for some time, but I could never find it. Finally I got a copy from a friend and watched it. It was a waste of time. I was very disappointed that the director did not have the guts to tell a real story. The movie was interesting in parts, but the whole thing was a let down. It was obvious that the director did not care about the story. It was just a story about a couple of people who were friends, and had a bad marriage, and ended up killing themselves. It was not a very interesting story, and the whole thing was very predictable. The characters were not very interesting, and the actors did not act very well. I did not care to see the end of this movie, and I am glad I did not have to pay for it. It is a real let down.

 This film is soooo bad. The acting is terrible. The script is awful. And the direction is atrocious. It's not even a good attempt at a music video. It's a music video that's trying to be a movie. If the song was good, maybe I'd give the movie a better grade. The song is bad though, so it's not a choice at all. I don't know how to describe the plot. There's a girl in a hospital, and she has a bunch of different men that visit her. But I can't tell who the main character is. The girl's name is "Kara" I'm not sure. The hospital scenes are really boring though. I would have preferred them to have been cut out completely. But they are in the film. And they are painful. I was bored out of my mind during those scenes. I did get a kick out of the fake movie trailer though, but that's it. The end scene is just so incredibly stupid, but it's not so bad I can't stand to watch it. Also, the ending is really confusing. I wish the whole thing was just cut out.

 I am a big fan of the original movie and had great expectations to the sequel.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this film. There is little action and the jokes don't work.

I wish it was shorter and had more action, because the first one was so perfect. The sequel is just not as good as the original.

 An awful, dirty, and not a little tasteless movie. This movie is a mess in every way. The acting, scripting, directing and the list goes on... It's like a porno movie straight to DVD. I'm not sure what to say about this movie, except that I was extremely disappointed in it. The acting is terrible, the script is awful, the direction is horrible, and the acting of the actors is so horrible, I can't even imagine how they made money with this movie. I hope nobody ever makes a sequel to this. The acting, the dialogue, the camera work and the script are all so bad, I can't even imagine how they got a major studio to ever release this movie on DVD. I'm not sure how this movie got made, but it's not good. The movie has a horrible plot. A girl gets abducted by an alien and then gets raped by him. I don't want to even bother describing much of the movie, I don't even want to say anything about the story. It's about a girl that gets abducted, raped, and then is given alien sperm by the alien. Also, there's a "twist" ending that is so awful I can't even
 I think the original movie was better. This one has too much plot holes and it's not funny at all. A lot of people keep saying that it's unfunny but I find it funny. This movie was a waste of time. They should have just made a sequel to the original instead.

It was great to watch the original movie again and see just how funny it was. The remake just wasn't funny at all.

I recommend the original movie over this one. I know a lot of people said that the original was unfunny and that it's a bad remake but I just don't see it. I think it's better than the remake.

Boring, boring, boring.

I gave it a 4 because it's better than the remake and the original is a 9.

It's okay.

 What a waste of time. I have never been so bored in my life! The plot and dialogue are terrible, the acting wooden and the plot just stupid and unbelievable. I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing! Just characters that came and went with no purpose. This film has got to be one of the most boring films ever made and is a complete waste of time. I am now going to watch the film that made this one look so good. And it was not even a bad film. The plot was interesting and the acting did not ruin the film. I would never go and see this film again! The film is boring, the plot is stupid, the acting is wooden and the plot is unbelievable. I am sure I will be alone in this, but I think the film is about a man who is accused of murder. It is a very poor film, I thought at first it was just a bad copy but I am now sure it is a copy. I would never go and see this film again, I would recommend the film that this one is supposed to be based on. It is much better.

The only thing good about this film is the interesting plot.

 The third installment of the Scooby Doo series had the misfortune of sharing its release date with Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, but it didn't suffer the same fate as that film. It was widely panned by critics, who gave it a dismal 5/10. As a big Scooby Doo fan, I found it a little difficult to get into, but I persisted and eventually got into it. With a little patience, it's quite possible that one could get into this film. It's not a good one, but as a Scooby Doo film, it's not horrible either. The acting is a mixed bag, like most of the other Scooby Doo movies, but it's okay. The writing is okay, but not great. It's the usual formulaic, clichéd humor that you find in most Scooby Doo movies. I'd describe it as a "B" film.

I didn't appreciate the ending very much, as it somewhat spoiled the ending of the last movie. However, I found the whole film to be enjoyable, even though it didn't quite meet my high expectations. It's definitely worth seeing once, but it's not a must-see.
 I know they say this is a a comedy or comedy/romance but it really is not. I don't want to spoil anything... but the story line is terrible. I understand it is written by the same people who created "The Parent Trap". I think they are trying to do something different... but sadly it's not. The only reason I watched this was to see what was going to happen to the 'child actors'. I'm sure you can guess... They didn't change a thing for this movie. I saw the Parent Trap when it first came out & it was one of my favorites. However, this movie is not. I don't know what in the world they were thinking when they created this movie. All I can say is... Don't waste your time watching this film. I'm very disappointed.

My Rating: 1 out of 10.

**Spoiler Alert*

The entire time I was watching this movie I kept thinking "What a waste of time." It was just so boring. They could have had a great movie if they would have just cut out a few scenes. I thought "Where were the child actors?" I don't think they were in the movie... they were just there to
 This movie is so bad it's good. The plot is so thin and ridiculous it's hilarious, the acting so bad it's terrific and the score so loud it's amazing. If one can figure out why this movie was made, it will be a miracle. The plot is so thin and stupid and the casting so bizarre that it's almost worth watching, especially if you want to see an actress who could not act an ounce worse than the lead in this movie. There is no way to review this movie without giving it an award for the worst movie of the year. It is not a comedy, it is not a horror film, and it is not a dramatic film. It is a car crash of the worst kind. I would rather see a film that is so bad it's good than watch this film again. The only plus side is the music is so great that you can't help but like it.

8) The Hive (France/Spain)

This movie was a total surprise. At first I thought it was a good movie, but then I got to the end and realized it was just a short film with a high budget. If one can imagine a short movie with a
 I don't even know where to begin. This movie started out with a bang and then became a slow burn that went nowhere. The plot is just so flimsy and the dialogue is awful. I'm sorry to say I just couldn't get involved. I don't know what director/writer is responsible for this except that he/she is just plain stupid to think that this will be a good movie. The "scary" scenes are just clichés and the music is just terrible. I am a huge horror/thriller fan and I had to force myself to stay the distance to the end. I am far from being a critic and maybe I am being too harsh but my rating is a generous 2 out of 10.

***SPOILER*** I am going to give the movie an extra star for the ending. I am not a big fan of the way the movie ended. I think the writer/director/director of photography was just plain stupid to think that this would be a good movie but what can you do. I am not the biggest fan of the ending but I understand it. I rate the ending 4 out of 10.

***SPOILER*** I guess the only good thing about this movie
 I have to admit that I had hoped for more from this movie. The cast was good and the story was pretty intriguing. However, in the end I found the movie too predictable and not very exciting. I think that it suffered from the basic problem that it wasn't very original and didn't have any great surprises. Even though it has some good moments, it is not a movie that I would recommend to anyone.

The Truth About Jane is a very interesting movie. It is not just a typical romantic comedy. It is an interesting and sometimes very funny film about a couple of spies who pretend to be a couple of newlyweds. The movie is based on a true story and is based on the book "The Perfect Spy" by Tim Lahaye. The movie is a mix of comedy and romanticism. It is a very good balance. The story is about a couple of spies who pretend to be a couple of newly weds. The movie is interesting and the cast is very good. I think that for some people the movie is not very entertaining and maybe too slow. But for me it was a good movie and I enjoyed it.

 The plot is so thin, so incredibly thin, that it doesn't take more than a few minutes to figure it out. The only thing that is surprising is that it has taken so long for someone to come up with this idea. A mysterious stranger (the director of the film himself) shows up in a small town and finds that his wife and child have disappeared without a trace. He lives in a house that he built himself and keeps a large cellar underneath it. He has a lot of money and spends it on building a vast underground complex in which he keeps a number of people who have been taken from the streets of the town and never seen again. These people are kept in the cellar for some period of time, whether a day or many years, until they are finally released into the world. The mysterious stranger, who is never seen in the film, is the only person who knows the story behind the people who have disappeared and the people who have been released and the people who are still in the cellar. The whole thing is just a big ruse. The stranger is a psychotic who has been taking random people and keeping them in the cellar. There is a lot of speculation as to what the underground complex is used for and how the
 This movie is so unbelievably bad, even M-pix (who made the movie) said that it was the worst thing they ever made. The movie is so bad that it only uses 6 actors. In the first movie, they used 12. Not only that, but the movie is so short that the actors are probably talking to each other, or behind the camera. The movie is so bad that you cannot even understand what they are saying, or what they are doing. The movie has no plot, or logic, or even structure. It just goes from one scene to another. The movie also has some of the worst special effects I have ever seen. Please do not waste your time and money on this movie. The story line is so bad, that you would not even want to watch this movie. If you want to see good special effects, go to the movies. If you want to see bad special effects, go to the internet. If you want to see a movie that is so bad that it is not even funny, go to the internet.

 This movie is a real disappointment! If you want to see a movie that is bad and also a must see, then see this one! This movie is bad, plain and simple. The only thing good about this movie is that it is indeed a movie. It is not a documentary, it is not a movie that is showing real life, it is just a movie. It is the story of a woman who gets pregnant and has to have an abortion. No, she does not have to go to any doctor, she just gets on a bus and goes to a doctor who performs abortions. The only reason this movie is so awful is because it is completely unreal. No one would ever get an abortion for free and no one would ever have to go to an abortion clinic. The producers have obviously made this movie to make something out of nothing, and the thing is, they have done a great job at it. The movie is bad, yes, but the story of the movie is actually in the script. It is just a real life story. The only thing that is good about the story is the fact that they are talking about the abortion issue. The movie is in essence a documentary, but the movie itself is very bad. If you
 I am not sure if this film is as bad as a lot of reviewers say but I can't understand why it got so many good reviews. It has no plot, no real characters and is just a series of random events. Nothing flows or makes sense. I guess the main problem is that I don't really know what it was doing there. There are no real characters and the plot is just a series of events that have no clear connection. It is also very badly edited, with all the scenes being overlong and boring. The only good thing about this film is that it is shot on location in London and has a good soundtrack. Not worth seeing or renting.

Comments: I saw this film on the Sci Fi channel and I couldn't believe the poor quality of it. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I usually love Sci Fi movies. If you want to see a good sci fi movie then see another and if you want to see bad copycat sci fi then see this. Don't waste your time.

 I was very hesitant to watch this movie because of its mediocre reviews. I've never watched a horror flick that I've hated so much. I don't see what all the hype was about. The movie wasn't scary; it was boring and completely stupid. I only watched it because of the cast. However, the casting was pretty good. I thought that Gail O'Grady was hilarious. I knew that she was a comedic actress, but this movie was a pleasant surprise. She was hilarious in this movie and was the only reason that I kept watching. The rest of the cast was also pretty good. I really liked the two main characters, although they weren't really scary. The movie was pretty good, but I don't think that I would watch it again. The only good thing about it was O'Grady's performance. I was very disappointed in her. She was great in "Girls Behaving Badly" and had much better comedic timing than this movie. I would rather watch that movie over this one. It's not worth the time.

"The Return of Swamp Thing" is a rather forgettable comic book adaptation from 1989. It's a pretty simple movie with a pretty
 I have seen this movie several times - it is truly a terrible film. The acting is bad and the script is not only lame but wimpy and unsubtle. I suppose one could say that the film is "realistic" because it is supposedly based on actual events, but I have no idea what the characters are going through. I suppose that the director was trying to make a "human" movie but what he came up with was a lame, unrealistic, utterly unconvincing and unconvincing. I am surprised that this movie has any fans at all. If you want to see a film about Vietnam I would suggest something more intelligent, like Platoon or Full Metal Jacket.

Also, the movie is marketed as being about the war in Vietnam and how the "adolescents" are not interested in fighting, etc. What the movie actually is about is how the "adolescents" are not interested in "adolescence" at all.

I do not recommend this movie at all.

Suffering from the "DSS" - Dumb, Stupid and Silly.

 It's a story about a super-villain team of robots on a mission to destroy all the humans on Earth. The robots are under the leadership of a robot called Uniquecobra (pardon my spelling) who has the amazing ability to turn invisible. This is a great idea, but the movie is just not very good. The movie starts out with Uniquecobra going invisible and attacking a man who is in his robe. His wife runs into the room and is chased out. The man then sees Uniquecobra in the next room and tries to attack him, but ends up being stabbed by the robot. The camera then pans to the woman in the next room and we see she has been stabbed too. The man then runs out of the room and the woman follows, and we hear a gunshot. The woman dies and the man is taken to the hospital. A man comes and opens the man's robe and sees Uniquecobra. They want to kill it but the hospital won't let them. The man who's robe was opened then comes out of the hospital and goes after Uniquecobra. The man reveals himself to be the person who stabbed the man in the robe, and
 The movie starts off with a scene showing a mansion and then shows a guy getting shot in the temple. This is a bad sign. Then the movie jumps to the present day and shows us that the mansion is the place where the first killing took place. The killer, who is really called "the Wolf" is still after the girls, and so we meet a new killer called "the Beast". The movie is pretty lousy, but it has an interesting ending, so give it a try.<br /><br />4/10

 This is one of those movies I have seen, where I just couldn't get into it. I thought it was pretty slow going and at times boring. Chris Klein and Jennifer Love Hewitt are two of the best young actors around. I think this movie could have been made a lot better if they were able to cast other actors instead of these two. I didn't think they were the best actors together. The only part of the movie I liked where the old man was an actor was when he was talking to the kid and said he was in the wrong line of work. I think if they could have found the right actors to play the roles this movie could have been much better. I give it a C+.

 I am a big fan of "The Big Lebowski" and Jeff Bridges, and was looking forward to seeing this movie. I was very disappointed in what I saw. I feel the movie could have been so much more, but it was ruined by the poor script. It felt like a rehash of some of the same ideas, scenes and characters found in "The Big Lebowski", but this time in a very different setting. I would have been OK with this, but the whole movie is set in Los Angeles, California, and that just seemed to be a huge rip off of the last movie. I think they should have changed a few things, changed the name of the characters and the place, and called it a sequel.

A good film but with a poor script

Author: j_taylor from United States

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This film was a very good film, but I must agree with the other person who said it was "poorly written". By that I do not mean
 This film is a pathetic attempt at trying to make a horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and instead makes you yawn. The story is just not that interesting, and the characters are so one dimensional that you don't care if they live or die. The acting is also very poor and the characters are so wooden that it's hard to care. The special effects are so fake they are laughable. The only thing the film has going for it is the cover art, which is a nice cover. This is a film you can skip over and not miss anything.

The DVD is quite good. It has quite a good picture and sound, and there are quite a few extras on the disc. The only extras are a trailer for the film, and a photo gallery. That's it.

Out of the special effects, the only thing that was really good (the demon) was really poorly done. The rest is horrible. The lighting in the film looks like a low budget film. The acting is very wooden and the characters are so one dimensional that it's hard to care about whether they live or die. The story is just not that interesting,
 I saw this movie on a plane, and I must say that I was surprised. I had never heard of the movie before, and I really didn't know what to expect. I also have never seen a movie that shows a more extreme and unrealistic view on what a hero is. I'm not talking about a hero in a comic, or in a book, but in a movie. I just cannot believe that so many people agree that we need a hero. I mean, we teach children that the world is a good place, and that we should help those who are in need. But in the most of the movies, we have been taught that we should always help those who are strong, and that no one should help those who are weak. I cannot believe that people in the world are this ignorant. I have seen a few movies that have been good for me, such as the Shawshank Redemption, and I have seen a few bad movies that I have given up on completely, like the Green Mile.<br /><br />I was so surprised by this movie. I thought that it would be, at least, a little bit of a comedy. It wasn't. It was a sad movie, with a few jokes and
 I really wanted to like this movie, but sadly it was not to be. First of all, the acting is annoying. The whole family, except for the child actors, are all acting like they are in a soap opera, but the child actors are too young to pull it off. The child actors should have been a little older and then they could have been more believable. The child actors are all cute, but it is just to much if you ask me. The acting by the parents is worse yet. I mean, really, do you really think that someone would say that to their daughter? The way they yell at the little girl is creepy, and I would not have been able to watch that. The fact that they are so overprotective of her is also creepy. I know that they have to be, because they have been through a lot in their lives, but still, the acting is just too over the top. The movie just isn't believable at all. I think the reason that I liked the movie was because of the child actors. They were so good, and they were real, different from the acting in most movies. I think that it would have been better if the child actors had been older, because then
 I was very excited to see this movie, and was looking forward to a fun and energetic film. There were two scenes in the film that I found quite funny. One was when the man in the movie was getting a haircut, and the barber actually put the scissors down on his shoulder and said "I'm sorry, I'm not trying to cut you." The other was when the man was walking down the street and someone said "you look like you've been in a fight." I think the movie should have been made in the 80s, and you would have thought the actor was a bit older. Otherwise, it was really a disappointment. I think if I see the movie again, I will have to pay attention to what was actually happening in the film. Does anyone know if the trailers for the film are based on a different film? Or was the film shot with 2 cameras? Did the director just add a lot of effects to the film to make it look better? I don't know. I just felt sorry for this film. I think it was nice for the actors to be in this film, but it doesn't mean that the film was any good.

 I actually enjoyed this movie, but everytime I watch it, I wonder how they thought they were going to get away with it. The "plot" is a remake of the first "Planet of the Apes" movie. A peaceful and prosperous planet is destroyed by a huge explosion and everything is changed. Is this the same planet? No. There is no evidence that this is the same planet. It's the same actors, it's the same characters, it's the same situation. The end of the movie is a complete rip-off of the ending of the original. The only difference is that in the original, the ape-men are portrayed as good guys and the humans are portrayed as evil. In this movie, the opposite is true. The same characters are involved.

 This is a true crime story that should have been left well enough alone. This is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. The plot is that a woman is raped and killed, and then her daughter is blamed for the crime. A private eye is hired to find the real killer. The plot is so trite and hackneyed that it would make a bad soap opera. The only good thing about the movie is that it is not long. It is a shame that this was a made for television movie.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of bad movies. I can't understand how it passed the MPAA ratings. It is not a good movie, but it is not bad enough to warrant an NC-17 rating. If you have to rent this movie, rent it with caution.

 The script is OK, but the acting is terrible and the direction is horrible. The sound is barely audible, and the camera work is terrible. The animal acting is bad, and the acting of the main character is bad. The cinematography is repetitious, and I watched the film to see if there was some reason to watch more of it. There isn't. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

 This is a truly awful film. I hate to say it, but it is so bad that I can't help but rate it. I've seen some truly awful films, but this one takes the cake. It is awful. I've seen worse, don't get me wrong, but this one is so bad that just the sound alone makes me cringe.<br /><br />The plot is a contrived one. I mean, REALLY contrived, but I don't have a point really. There isn't really a plot. It is a film, and it is a film that you should watch if you like this kind of film, but it is not a film that you should actually go to see. It is a film that you should watch if you like to watch bad films, but it isn't a film that you should actually go to see. It is a film that you can watch and say "I've seen worse". But it is not a film that you should go to see. Watch it at home and you'll be fine. If you like this kind of film, then this is a film that you should go to see.

The story is about a man who is a serial killer. Nothing surprising there
 I wish I could give this movie anything but 2 stars. The story is so bad, it's ridiculous. The acting is so bad, I couldn't even tell who was acting, who was acting in front of a green screen, who wasn't, who was actually in the movie, who was in a different movie, who was on a different planet, who was a ghost, who was a robot. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie. The only thing that is good about it is that it's short. If you have nothing to do, and are in the mood for a good movie that you can doze off to, then rent it. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "I can't doze off to a movie that's that bad!" Let me reassure you. You can. It's that bad, it's that bad, it's that bad.<br /><br />If you are still reading this, perhaps you are interested in what I thought of the movie. I thought it was so bad, it was good. I laughed at it, I cried at it, I loved it, I hated it. But the actors were so bad, they were good. It was just a
 This movie contains the same old recycled plot, with a different actor playing the same role. If you've seen one or two of these movies, you've seen them all. All the actors do is re-enact the same dramatic scenes, with the same predictable dialogue. The only thing I can say that is original is the use of a talking coyote to illustrate the main character's lack of trust in his men. <br /><br />Although the actors are very good, the movie is too predictable, with the same type of scenes being enacted over and over again. I don't think this is a good movie for young viewers, as there is no real suspense, no real danger. I thought it was funny that there was a coyote in the movie, but I guess he wasn't supposed to be funny. He was supposed to illustrate the main character's lack of trust in his men, but he didn't come off as a real character. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you're looking for a good drinking movie, you might enjoy this.

 This movie is one of the most boring "cops and robbers" movies I have ever seen. The clothes, the hair styles, the cars, the music, the movie...all of it was ridiculous. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen because I was so bored. It would have been better if it had been 3 hours long. I have seen worse movies than this, but this is definitely the worst in my opinion. I will never watch this movie again.

 I was shocked at the low ratings and low comment on this movie. I only saw the first half of the movie, but I was shocked at the direction that the movie was going. I am not a fan of the big box office films. I am a fan of the small independent films. However, I think that this movie was a disgrace to the people that made it, and it was a disgrace to the people that saw it. The acting was terrible, and the film was just a bore. There was no storyline. It was a shame that such a high budgeted film with a lot of talent went to waste. I would never recommend this movie to anyone, or anyone seeing this movie for the first time.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this movie.

 How do you make a movie about an aging football star who is the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers? The movie that you make is about a guy who is a football star, but only for one game. He gives everything he has to the game and his team loses. In the end he is left with nothing.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that's supposed to make you think, but it just falls flat. If you're expecting some insight into the life of a football star, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you want to see a movie about football, you're better off trying to get your hands on the NFL films.

 The review below does not make it clear that the movie is a documentary. I believe that the director was trying to give us an insight into the way these men felt about their situation, but the movie was so poor in quality that it was difficult to take in what was being said. This was not a movie about a group of soldiers who were being held captive in a foreign country. It was a movie about a group of soldiers who were held captive in a foreign country. The movie should be called "In a Foreign Land: A Soldier's Perspective". I found it to be a very poor attempt at showing the viewer the reality of being a prisoner of war.

The movie made it seem like their lives were not changed by being in captivity. They were just living their lives as they had before. In fact, it seemed like the movie was trying to show that the men had no idea what was going on or what was going on with them. There wasn't even a mention of the POW's families or the families of their captors. They were just there to make it clear that there was a war going on. If I was a member of the military, there is no way that I would watch this movie. I would think
 I am of the generation that saw the original "The Twilight Zone" series and loved them. That same generation also saw the original "X-Files" series and loved them. The same generation also saw the original "Star Trek" series and loved them. And so on. TV has always been a great medium for great storytelling. The problem with some modern shows is that they just don't deliver great storytelling. They just feel like they have been thrown together in a hurry. "Wayward Pines" is a perfect example of this. <br /><br />I watched the first season of this show and was not impressed. It was well acted, but it seemed so random and nonsensical. It felt more like a series of random events than a story. The second season seemed to be a big improvement, as it seemed to be a real story and character development as opposed to just random events. However, the third season has made it so that the show doesn't seem to have a direction or a clear story line. It just seems like the writers can't decide what they want to do with the characters, so they throw them all into an episode and hope that something interesting happens.<br /><br />This is a show that
 I thought it was a good movie in the beginning and the end. But, it was heavy on the jokes. By the way, I saw this movie after the first day of the release. I didn't know that this movie was so popular and liked a lot of people. But, I did not like it.

 I was surprised to find that this film was given a rating of 8/10 on IMDb. I'm pretty surprised I didn't see it given a 1, as I found it to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, and one of the most painful to watch.<br /><br />This film is so painful to watch because it is so dreadfully written, and directed. It is obviously based on a true story, but the way that the story is presented is so suspect. The acting is horrible, and the dialogue is just as bad, if not worse. I honestly believe that the dialogue was written by a non-native English speaker, and was then translated into English.<br /><br />Most of the time, the only reason I made it through the film was because I wanted to finish it. I have seen far worse films in my time, but this one is one of the worst I have ever seen, and I'm glad that I have seen far worse, which is the only reason I can really justify giving this film anything over a 1.

 First of all, I have to agree with many of the other reviewers in that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have seen many bad movies in my time, but this one was just terrible. The acting was horrible, and the plot was bad. The only thing I liked about it was the music, but otherwise, it really was a bad movie. It is just not worth the time to see.

The only reason I saw this movie was because I had heard it was a horror movie, and I figured it was worth a shot before sleeping. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The plot was bad, the acting was bad, and the characters were bad. The only thing I could say in favor of this movie was that the music was good. But, even that was not enough to carry the movie.

I could go on for a long time about how bad this movie was, but I will stop here. Just stay clear of this movie. I wouldn't even give it 10/10.

(I know, I know, I should be reviewing this movie. I will get back to it. Just
 This film is very weak in the acting department and is more suited to late night television than a movie theater. The story is weak and leaves you with the feeling of being cheated. I would not recommend this film to anyone. I saw it in the theater and at home, but still would not recommend it.

*SPOILER ALERT*

The ending of the film contradicts the main character's actions, as he attempts to save his wife from a burning plane and ends up killing her.

*SPOILER ALERT*

The film final scene has the main character in a mental institution and the audience is left to wonder whether this is a fantasy or a reality.

*END SPOILER ALERT*

I did not like the film and would not recommend it.

 This is a really bad movie. I rented it because it was a movie about a monster destroying a town. It is not scary, it is stupid and it is not funny. The acting is horrible and the plot is ridiculous. I have no idea why this movie is so popular. I think people are just looking for a cheap thrill and this movie delivers. There is absolutely no suspense, no atmosphere and no good acting.

The monster is supposed to be real and it was not scary at all. I think that the director wanted to prove that the monster is real by having someone jump out of the water and scream. It just shows that the director does not know how to scare people. The movie is supposed to be a fast paced horror movie, but it is not. I think the director wanted to show the monster destroying the town, but it was not scary at all.

This movie is so bad that it is not funny. The monster was just the same as it is in all other movies. The movie was so bad that I just could not get into it. I just kept watching it to see if the monster would do something different. It would just jump out of the water and it would chase some people. What
 The only reason I rented this movie was because of the pretty boy actor. I was expecting the usual trash, but was pleasantly surprised. The story actually held my interest, and the acting was decent. The only real complaint I have is the editing. The movie seemed very disjointed, and while the story was understandable, I felt like I was being jerked around. I liked the ending, but it seemed to be thrown together, and didn't seem very logical. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, this isn't it. If you're looking for a decent movie to rent, this is it. I'd recommend this movie, but only if you're looking for a decent Drama, rather than an action movie.

6.0 out of 10 stars Pretty good movie, but not great. I really liked this movie, but I don't think it was as good as everyone else thinks it is. For example, I think the movie dealt with some serious subjects, but it wasn't treated in the most appropriate way. The movie was very disjointed, and I felt like I was watching a series of short mini episodes, instead of one long story. The acting was great, but some of the characters
 The cover of this DVD is the best thing about it. The movie is basically the same thing that has been done in the past about a man with a talent for seeing into the past, and a woman with a talent for sex with men. The whole thing is so predictable, that I had to keep myself from falling asleep.<br /><br />The special effects are very good, but that doesn't help the story. The story is supposed to be about destiny, but it is very hard to believe that two people could possibly be destined to be together. They are just too different. The story is so predictable, it is almost ridiculous. If you are going to watch this movie, be prepared to be bored to death.<br /><br />I gave this 2 stars, because in all fairness, the movie is not half bad. The special effects are very good, and it is a very good story. The problem is that the story is so predictable, it is almost laughable.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm no film critic, nor even a movie buff. But I thought this was an excellent movie.
 This was a terrible movie. I was excited to see it because I was a fan of the original 1970s version of this movie, but this is a terrible remake. It is a waste of time, it is a waste of money, and it is a waste of talent. The acting is horrible, the editing is horrible. This movie could have been made in the 60s, looks like it was made in the 80s, and from what I've heard it was made in the 90s. I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this is the worst I have ever seen. I would not even give this movie a 1 out of 10.

 This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Boring, bad acting, bad directing and story line that was very difficult to follow. The use of CGI was also very distracting. I am a fan of the previous movies in the series and this one was a big disappointment.

The film is not very good and it wasn't even as good as the previous ones. There are some scenes that are just stupid and I was shocked that it was made. I still loved the first two though.

 I just got back from watching this film and frankly there is no way I could give it a high rating, I mean the film itself is just so bad it's funny. The acting is really bad, the story is really bad, the actors are really bad, the script is really bad, the direction is really bad and the makeup is really bad. So no wonder the film was a bomb on opening day, I mean this film is just that bad. I mean I think the film makers got a bunch of people from the cast of 'Casper' and the story was all that was left, but the film makers failed to think of a good ending and it's just a mess. I mean I've seen some bad films but this was just bad. I mean the acting is so bad I can't even make a comment on it, and the dialogue is so bad I can't even make a comment on it. I mean the story is very clunky, the acting is so bad there is no way I could make a comment on it, the direction is so bad there is no way I could make a comment on it, the script is so bad there is no way I could make a comment on it and the makeup is so
 I really regret watching this movie. There's nothing special in it and it seems that it was made in the 90s (still the same old problems). A boring story with a horrible ending, it's just a waste of time. I don't know what the director was thinking when he decided to make this movie. He obviously decided to make a movie that would be completely different from anything he'd done before. But he didn't succeed. The characters are just too one dimensional, the dialog is boring and the actors are just not able to make the movie work. The girl is extremely annoying and the guy is just not interesting enough. They both have a problem with alcohol, but the girl is just way too young to be hooked on alcohol. It's a very bad movie, I don't think I'll ever watch it again.

I can only recommend this movie to people who like to watch bad movies just for the sake of it. I would have rated this movie 2/10, but since I couldn't give it a 1 I'll give it a 2.

If you've seen this movie and it's still one of your favorite movies, I can understand that, but the movie itself is just not good enough to
 This movie gave me a headache. I know that it's supposed to be a comedy, but it's very dark, it's supposed to be funny, but it's not. It's just boring and depressing. The actors are not very good, except for the lead actress who is good but not great. Overall, it was a boring and depressing movie. I strongly recommend no one to see it.

 I was really excited to see this movie, and had high hopes for it. When I finally saw it, I realized that it had been nominated for a Razzie, so I was expecting it to be awful. It turned out to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />As I was watching it, I couldn't help but notice that the movie seemed to be mocking itself at every turn. The plot is pretty much "Let's make a movie that has no plot and no character development, and make fun of the fact that it's a movie that has no plot and no character development." It's really awful, and the acting is horrible. The worst part of the movie is that the actors are obviously trying to be funny. I've never seen anything so painful in my life. The only way to get through it is to laugh at how awful it is.<br /><br />The worst part is the ending (spoiler alert: everyone gets killed). If you're looking for a movie that is intentionally bad, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie that is unintentionally bad, look elsewhere.

 Horrible. This movie is for those who like to watch their own death with a big smile on their face. Would you like to see your kids die? Then this is the movie for you. This movie is so bad that it is good. What is this movie about? That we all die and some people don't want to die. This is a laughing matter for people who like to watch people die.

 From IMDb: "Misfits of Science" is an American television series that aired on ABC from September 13, 1994, to April 30, 1996.<br /><br />The series was about a group of young people who are scientifically-inclined and are forced to enroll in a government-funded laboratory together. The lab, called "The Institute", was where "Misfits of Science" was shot.<br /><br />The series was created by Chris Carter, who also created the hit series "The X-Files" and "Millennium", which both starred David Duchovny (Agent Mulder).<br /><br />The series was a ratings success and was renewed for a second season, but only a few episodes were produced before it was canceled. The series was one of the few ABC series that was actually canceled but was brought back through a series of TV movies.<br /><br />The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at the same time of "Millennium".<br /><br />The series was not very popular, even though it had a successful run in syndication. "Misfits of Science" was shot during the same time
 I'm sorry but I have to give this movie 1 out of 10. I was in a theater with my kids and I had to leave because I couldn't take it any more. The acting was horrible, the whole movie just seemed like a joke. The only thing that made it watchable was the music, which was fairly good, but that's it. I can't believe that the director was a screenwriter for the original Gremlins movies. That's a big red flag. The story was just stupid and didn't have any point. I know that you have to have a plot to have a movie but this just didn't make any sense. The only thing that was good was the time travel, that was pretty cool. I mean I'm a big time travel fan but even I could see that this was just a stupid movie. I wish I could get my money back.

I am so sorry that I had to give this movie a 1 out of 10. I thought it was great at first but then the stupid story and stupid acting started to get to me.
 I really hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this movie is terrible. I have the same problem with many of the similar films from the 80's and early 90's, such as the "Radar Men From the Moon" series. The acting is amateurish at best, and the productions values are that of a straight to video movie, which is unfortunate because the premise is quite interesting. The first episode has the crew meet up with an alien and take him back to the mothership. From there, he takes his place in the crew and they are sent on a mission to stop the evil leader of a planet who is making an energy weapon. The rest of the episodes follow these events, but they are all quite weak.<br /><br />The acting is mostly bad, with the exception of the two leads, who are surprisingly good. The aliens are quite comical, but the worse acting is from the regular crew, who sound like they are reading lines from a script. This is a shame because the story is actually quite interesting and does have some interesting ideas. The special effects are quite poor for the time, but that is to be expected.<br /><br />I would suggest seeing it if you have nothing
 I think that this movie is extremely overrated. If you are a fan of the original, which I myself am, you will probably hate this movie. It's very different from the original. I'm not sure if it is good or bad. It's not a bad movie, but it's not the best. It's just that it's not the same as the original. I have to admit that I liked the original better. This movie doesn't have the same sound as the original, so I think that the actors should have had the same voices as the original. I think that the female lead actress was very good in the original, but in the new movie, she was not as good. I think that the director should have been different too. I think that the original director, who directed the pilot and the first season of the original, was a much better director. I think that the original director was also a much better writer. Overall, I think that this movie is not a good movie, but it is still a good movie. The original is always better, and this is not a good movie. I think that this movie is nothing more than a modern remake of the original, and it doesn't compare to the original
 I was expecting a spoof, but it was more of a parody. The movie was supposed to be a spoof, but it was not. It was a bad spoof. The story was not that good and the acting was not good. The movie was not funny and it was not even clever. I expected something totally different but they went with the same story again. The movie went nowhere and it was just a waste of time.

 I was a little hesitant to watch this movie. I am a fan of the original book, but I didn't want to see a remake that would be too different from the original book. I was probably wrong.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman, who was great in Rain Man, did an okay job with this movie. He was a good choice for the role of Nick, the protagonist of this movie.<br /><br />I thought the acting was good, but the writing was terrible. The whole movie seemed to be lacking in good dialogue. Some of the lines were good, but the majority of them were very cheesy. I guess I found it hard to believe that someone in a coma could be so articulate.<br /><br />There were also some very bad lines in the movie. For example, one of the characters says "I have to go to the bathroom". That is bad because you have to go to the bathroom. If you have to take a piss, you say "I have to go to the bathroom". You don't say "I have to go to the bathroom" when you don't have to go to the bathroom. This is just one example of bad writing in this movie.<br /><
 This film is a real disappointment. It is totally without any of the humor that I've come to expect from Eric Idle. I've been a fan of his work since The Rutles and Monty Python, and I'm sorry to say that I've had my fill of his other films. I haven't seen all of them, but the ones I have seen I've really not liked. The first one I saw was the "Carry On" series, and I found it to be too silly and all too obvious. The movie I saw last night was the "Connections" series, and I was shocked to find that it was as bad as I thought it would be. I'm a fan of Eric Idle and I've felt that his work has been getting progressively worse and worse, but this was just a total let down. It's not terribly funny and the plot is so predictable that it's annoying. The only reason I can even remotely justify watching this movie was for Sean Connery's appearance, which was excellent. I would recommend that you stay clear of this one.

It is clear that Idle has a very distinct style, but it's not one that I personally enjoy. I will say, however, that I
 This review is based on the DVD version which I bought along with "Cop and a Half 2". I'll do a separate review for that one.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is that a police officer and a federal agent are assigned to an investigation of a serial killer and they have to team up. The two movies are very similar, but the only difference is that this one is more of a comedy. Both movies have a lot of jokes and the movie makers did a good job of keeping the pace up which is good because there are only about 30 minutes of entertainment here - which is a shame because there is a lot of potential here. The movie makers should have tried to make the movie a bit more serious and more dramatic - it would have been better.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of action, but the action is not that well done and the movie lacks a lot of suspense.<br /><br />This movie is not that bad - but it's not good either. It's better than the first movie, but it's still not good enough to watch.<br /><br />

 This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was at a movie night with friends the other night and we were all talking about how bad the movie was, we all felt the same way. I think this movie is so bad that it should be made into a movie of the week so people can see how bad it really is. I am sure it would be a hit. Unless you are a new born or have never seen a movie, then there is no point in watching this film.

 I saw this movie at my parents house with my friend. It was supposed to be a Halloween movie but we ended up watching it the day before (Which would be a Saturday). I was disappointed when I saw that it was a movie based off the book. This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It does not even look like a movie. The only thing that I thought was good about it was the part where the kid was trying to get through the door to the library. It was a ok movie but it was not a very good one. I got bored after the first 10 minutes and I stopped paying attention to the movie. It was very bad. If your looking for a good movie watch fight club or something but don't watch this movie.

 This is one of the worst TV movies ever. It has a horrendous plot, and the writing is on the level of the worst soap opera. I will tell you frankly that the plot is so bad you can't even tell if it has a plot at all. The acting is atrocious and the special effects are laughable. There are a few good moments, but they are few and far between. I never saw the original, but I have to say that this is nowhere near as good as the original. If you like bad TV movies, I would suggest you see this, but if you like good TV movies then you should stay away from this one.

A Bad Movie With a Bad Cast, 23 March 2004

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have always been a fan of "B" movies, and I have seen quite a few. Some of them are good, some are bad, and some are average. This one is very bad, and I would put it in the category of "bad" movies. This movie does have a few good things about it. It has an interesting concept, and some of the effects were good. The acting was okay, but the problem is that the movie is not
 After I watched this movie, I immediately started thinking of the movie as a great piece of art. The plot is intriguing, the acting is great, the movie is visually stunning, and the story is very well thought out. However, I can't watch it again because I have an extreme dislike for this movie and its plot.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the plot is bad, that I don't like it, or that I don't believe the movie is a work of art. I just can't watch it again. I've seen it twice and I just can't stand to watch it again.<br /><br />The plot is about a group of international terrorists who plot to take over the world. The terrorists plan to start with Paris, then New York, then Los Angeles, etc. The plot is very unique and very good. It's full of action and suspense, and it's very well thought out. The only problem is that the story is about terrorists taking over the world. It's about as original as a movie about terrorists taking over the world could get. I guess that's the point of the movie, but it just doesn't work for me. It's
 I was hoping for an interesting story about a once successful inventor now trying to parlay the success of his last invention into a new one with a hard hitting story about an inventor. Instead the movie has the filmmaker trying to do too many things at once with the result being a incoherent mess. The story of the inventor's life is nothing special and the main character is a generic 50's guy with a love interest. The plot of the film is a strange mix of a political thriller, a love story and a medical story. The movie is not helped by a clunky script that doesn't make sense and is filled with clumsy exposition. The dialog is pretty bad and the editing is not good. There is a lot of music. There is also a lot of violence. The filmmakers don't even try to make it look exciting. The worst thing about this poor movie is the mediocre acting of the leads. There are a lot of problems with this movie but I think the worst is the fact that the film just doesn't work. A bad movie is still a bad movie but this one just isn't even that good.

 I have to admit that I am one of the few people who liked the movie. I saw it in the theater and I was on the edge of my seat. The storyline is the best that I have seen in a long time. The acting is outstanding and the cast of characters are outstanding. I would recommend this to anyone who has a pulse. The movie is not for kids. It is like reading a good book, once you start,you can not put it down. I will watch this movie again and I will be ready for the DVD. If you want to see a good movie, this is it.

Oct. 9 2005 By Rick R. - Published on Amazon.com Format: DVD In the 40s, Vincent Price was in his heyday and there were few actors who could match him. "Thin Man" is a great example of his talent and versatility. He plays a man who tried to commit suicide by auto-erotic asphyxiation but instead falls into a coma. When he wakes up, he is confronted by a hospital staff who
 This movie is a disgrace to the entire human race. I found it to be very disturbing and disturbing should be the only word to describe it. The way the filmmakers showed the people of Iraq being tortured and killed is disturbing to say the least. They did the same thing to the people of the U.S. in the 1960's when they showed the Viet Nam people being tortured and killed, and the victims were not even aware that the torture and killing was being done to them or that there was even a war going on. This movie does not only show the Iraqi people being tortured and killed but also the American soldiers who were torturing them. To see the American soldiers torturing the Iraqis was a very upsetting experience and should be enough to make anyone not want to ever see a war being fought. The picture and sound quality of the movie was a bit grainy and that is probably why I found it disturbing. The actors and actresses in this movie were all very good and they did a fine job portraying the characters they were portraying. The setting was very well done and the story line was well told. The ending was a bit of a let down and the ending was very anti-climatic. I give the movie a 3 out of
 This movie has everything you've ever heard or read about a woman's revenge against her husband's mistress, but it is all wrong. No matter how much she torments her husband and his lover, the wife never comes across as the bad person. The wife just had a bad marriage and is a total bitch and that's all there is to it. If you're looking for a movie where the wife is portrayed as the antagonist, then this is the movie for you. You can either tear this movie apart or you can embrace it for the cheesy, campy, offbeat retro movie it is. I personally loved it and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 who enjoys a good old-fashioned revenge story.

 I watched this with my girlfriend. I saw the same guy in the same role in the movie The Package (which was actually better). And it was pretty clear to me that the guy who played the character in this movie was the same actor in The Package. It's pretty sad that a movie could be made and the same guy would play the same role in both movies in fairly similar ways. By the way the ending of this movie was the same as the ending of The Package.

I won't watch it again.

 The first half of this movie is absolutely ludicrous. I'm not talking about the ridiculous plot line that revolves around some sort of "alien" invasion. It's the set pieces; this movie could have been made by a third grader in a creative writing class. The dialogue is bad. The acting is bad. The special effects are terrible. The writing is pretty much non-existent. And the soundtrack is really really really really bad. I can't believe movies like this pass the test of the MPAA. I try to be fair and give the benefit of the doubt, but the bottom line is this movie is pretty much unwatchable. Unless you're a fan of the director, I wouldn't bother with this one, even if you find it at a discount store.

6/10

Note: I don't know if this one actually passed the MPAA test. It's not on my radar.

 I'm not a big fan of action movies. I'm pretty certain I've seen enough of them. They are generally hackneyed and banal. However, I felt compelled to watch this one because I had seen the ads. I was hoping that this would be different. It was not.<br /><br />This movie starts off well. It has promise. It seems like a good idea to mix the two genres by making a martial arts action movie. The problem is that the martial arts action is pretty weak. There is a long battle scene in which the main character is fighting a gang of thugs. He is fighting with a sword. It goes on and on, but the fighting is really not very well done. I also thought that the ending was a bit weak. It seemed to be missing a key piece of information that would have made the ending make more sense. I think that had the movie been cut down by about 10 minutes, the movie would have been considerably better. I'm very disappointed in this movie. I feel that the idea had potential, but it just wasn't executed very well. I give this one 2 stars out of 5.

 I remember the old black and white version of this movie. The version I saw in the 70's was in color and I saw it on tv. It was a good movie. I know the actors who were in it. They were great. I have to say that the new version of the story is very different in many ways. I think that the writer didn't know what to write about. He put some of the story in the old version. He left out the parts that were in the old version. The part with the old lady and the old man who was a baker was left out. It was really a sad story. I spent most of the time in the movie crying. I am only writing this review to warn other people that they might not like this movie. I know I wouldn't have liked it if I didn't know the old version. The acting was great, the story was good but that was all.

I know the people who made this movie. I liked them. I would give it a 3 1/2 out of 10.

I feel that this movie is a waste of time.

I watched the old version and I thought it was very good. I am sorry that I wasted
 I don't know what is so good about this movie. It's a comedy, I guess, but I don't find it funny at all. The plot is a joke, and the jokes that do work are so obvious that it's not funny anymore. I don't know if the whole point is that everything is so darn fake that it's not even funny anymore, but the fact that the plot is so contrived and unrealistic and the jokes are so lame makes me think that the whole thing is a joke, and that the whole point of the movie is to point out the fact that the film-making industry is a joke. So, this movie is a satire? I don't get that at all.

The plot is just a lamer version of the plot in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The whole thing is so obviously fake that it's just stupid. I mean, the plot is about a guy who pretends he's being held hostage in his own house, but the whole point is that "no one cares about the hostages!" The whole plot is a joke, and the whole plot is totally unbelievable. I mean, come on. A guy can't just pretend he's being held hostage in his house
 This is the worst film I have ever seen. There is no plot, no character development, no action whatsoever. My girlfriend and I just sat there staring at the screen in dismay. I'm not sure what I expected, but I have a feeling it was not this. The actors are all good, but the script is so atrocious that they cannot make any sense of it. I read the writing credits and they are all by different people. I got the feeling that they just had a bunch of people throw together a script and hoped it would work. It does not. It is a bad movie. I could tell the director was trying to make it different from the standard action movie, but in the end it is just a bad movie. I really do not know why so many people like this film. I know why I don't, and I know why you won't like it.

The Last Samurai (2003) The Last Samurai is a fun, action packed movie!! 8 June 2009 - 2 out of 3 users found this review helpful. This is a beautiful movie. I have seen it 2 times and I still enjoy it. The action
 The only reason I watched this movie is because of the second movie, "The Replacement Killers". I was very disappointed in this movie. The only good thing about it was that it was better than the first movie. The first movie was too slow and boring. This movie was too fast and too contrived. The acting was poor. And the story was just not believable. Then again, this is a movie for people who have nothing better to do. I would recommend the first movie over this one. I am not sure I would recommend "The Replacement Killers" over this one. I think that movie was better than this one.

5.0 out of 10 stars More than just a "CGI" movie Format: DVD I have seen a number of movies that use computer generated special effects in a movie, and this movie is no exception. The special effects are used for action scenes in particular. They are realistic, and it was done in such a manner that doesn't detract from the story. We don't even notice the special effects in the movie. The acting, while not Oscar-worthy, is still good. The sound effects are more than just "filler". It's all there, and it is definitely
 This movie is a tough one to watch. It is the story of a woman who is a drug addict, a prostitute, a bag lady and a criminal. The way the movie is shot and the sound is just awful. The sound is bad, the camera work is bad, the acting is bad and the story is bad. This is not a movie that you want to watch. It is not offensive, it is just a movie that you should not watch. I can't figure out why anyone would want to make this movie, I guess it is just to see what kind of horror movie can be made for free. If you want to see some horror, see "The Ring" or a good slasher film. If you want to see a movie that is bad, watch this.

I give this movie a 0 out of 10.

 A large chunk of the reviews for this movie are about how it "has a surprise ending" or "will leave you with a feeling of satisfaction". Both are true, if you're looking for a good movie. I was looking for a good movie. There's a lot of good acting in here, some good writing, and a few interesting scenes. But there's also a lot of space and empty scenes. The story is simple and the characters are flat and one dimensional. If you're looking for a good movie, I'd recommend anything by Kurosawa or the Wachowski brothers. But if you're looking for a movie that will entertain you, then please do yourself a favor and check out "The Big Lebowski".

<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the Coen brothers, and I've never seen "The Big Lebowski". I've read a few of the reviews of this movie and seen some of the scenes from the movie, but no one ever mentions how this movie has a surprise ending. This movie was so easy to figure out that it was obvious from the beginning. If you want to see a good surprise ending, watch "Schindler's List".


 I was looking forward to this movie. I've been reading a lot of good things about the book, and the movie looked promising. I was disappointed. It seemed like a bad made-for-TV movie. The story was dull, the acting was unbearably bad, and the dialog was awful. The story follows a group of characters, each one with a role to play in a murder. Some of the characters are very creepy, others are just plain boring. I was disappointed because this was based on a novel, and the novel was so good. I think the movie did the novel a disservice. The only thing good about this movie is the fact that it is set in New Orleans. The rest of it is just a bad movie.

If you're looking for a good thriller, this is not it. I did really love the way the movie ended though. I will say that I did like the fact that it was set in New Orleans. It is a beautiful city, and it is nice to see it on the big screen. I have been to New Orleans, and I have always wanted to go there again. I would definitely go back to the French Quarter and stay in the old French Quarter. I would

 This movie was horrible. The acting was not very good, the plot was confusing, the ending was anti-climatic, and I have the feeling that I have heard this story before. I've never seen the original movie, but I have read the novel, and have always wanted to see the movie version. Now I'll never get to see it. I'm glad I rented the video, but I was not glad to have wasted my time watching it.

I feel sorry for the actors in this movie, because they are clearly trying to do their best. I feel sorry for the director, because she had my attention in the beginning, and then didn't know what else to do with it. I feel sorry for the actors who have to work with her, and that she doesn't realize that she is not a good director. I've seen worse movies made by better directors.

The thing that really got to me was the ending, when the woman with the burnt face is lying in bed, and her husband is sitting next to her, holding her hand. I thought, "How horrible," and I feel like saying that I didn't like the movie.

I can't believe that I wasted my time
 The first thing that hit me about this film is the fact that in my opinion, the "Surface" was a better film, it was more exciting and had more suspense.<br /><br />This film has all the elements of a good film but, unfortunately, no one seems to care about their characters or their lives, not even the amazing and beautiful Ms. Gwyneth Paltrow. The lack of action and suspense is disappointing and it is also interupted by an unnecessary subplot of the gay husband trying to find his wife's murderer, who happens to be a gay man so that is also very irritating.<br /><br />The only reason I saw this film was because it had the world's most beautiful actress in it, that and the fact that it had James Franco in it. I believe Franco can do a lot better than this. The music is also irritating mainly because I can never get past the fact that the music is so bad it is annoying. Other than that this film was pretty much a boring and lame film.

Surface (2001)

Author: Thomas Moody
 This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and the worst movie I have ever seen in English, and the worst movie I have ever seen in any language. It is the worst movie ever, period. It is not funny, it's not interesting, it is not suspenseful, it's not scary, it's not romantic. It's not even boring. I mean, really. I can say that I have never seen a movie that I did not like at least some part of it. But this is the first time I have ever seen a movie that I had to skip parts of. It is so bad that I didn't finish it, because it is so boring that I couldn't bear to watch it any more. I do not recommend this movie to anyone at all. It is the worst film that I have ever seen. I know that there are some people who like it, but I have never seen anything like this in my life.

IMDB says it's a comedy, but after you watch it, you won't know what to laugh at. Besides, there's not a single joke in the entire film. If you think that a movie can't be both a comedy and a nightmare,
 And I thought I was a cynical person! It is one of those films that make you go, "Wow, how did they get that shot, that sound, that look?" and while the camerawork is absolutely superb, the writing is flat and the characters are unsympathetic. I know it is supposed to be a comedy, but it just isn't funny.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film and I thought the concept was very clever. The problem is that the idea has been played before and it is not a fresh idea. The problem is that the characters are not that interesting. I know it is supposed to be a lighthearted film, but the characters are far too dark.<br /><br />The acting is excellent - and well worth watching for that. But the script is just not good enough to carry the film along.

4.0 out of 5 stars The Film That's Always on My Telly Format: VHS Tape | Verified Purchase I remember when I first saw this film. I was living in London and it was on at the local Odeon. The film was being sold as a comedy and I remember thinking that this was not going to be very funny
 This film is the total opposite of a true story. The film is a good example of how people can be so ignorant and fake that they don't even know how to think for themselves. What an injustice, poor black people are treated like this. It shows how much anger and prejudice people have in this country. I'm angry too. I have always been a supporter of black people and I don't understand how anyone can be so ignorant and fake. This is not the true story. Poor black people are treated like this and the fact that people in this country are so ignorant to not know what is going on just proves the fact that people are so ignorant to not know the truth. They need to do better. This film was just a total waste of time because it showed people in this country are so ignorant and fake to not know the truth about black people.

I am so angry for the poor black people who are treated like this.

 I was in the mood for a decent documentary about the life of Salvador Dali and when I saw this one, it seemed like it just might be it, but I was sadly disappointed. If you want to know about Dali's life and times, do yourself a favor and read a biography or watch the biopic "Dali: The Persistence of Memory". This documentary is only about one aspect of Dali's life, the painting. It is too short to allow much detail and analysis of his work (which I found interesting). This documentary is not as well put together as it could be and there are several errors and scraps of information throughout the film. <br /><br />The viewer is left wondering what the point of the film is. I thought it was supposed to be about the art, but it only deals with one aspect of that art. This is a good documentary for someone who wants a quick overview of Dali's life, but it is not a good documentary for anyone who wants to know the real Dali. I recommend the biopic over this documentary.

 This film came as a surprise for me. I had heard only good things about it, and this time I decided to go see it. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The story is too complicated, and the actors are not very good at portraying their characters. I thought that the most important thing was to overcome the obstacles that the characters have to face, but that's not what happens. The film tries to be a serious movie, but it's not very convincing, and it's not even funny.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film, because I think it's a waste of time.

 I'm sorry to say this, but this movie was one of the worst movies I ever saw. It's about a group of people who are trapped in a small town and are trying to figure out how to get out. There is a big twist in the movie (spoiler alert) when it's revealed that the people trapped are actually actors. This was a spectacularly bad movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was stupid, and I think the story was poorly written. I'm sorry, but this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I give it a 1 out of 10.

 I don't know why this movie was made. It's just a poor copy of "The Monster Squad", and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The acting was terrible, the storyline was poor, and the special effects were laughable. I really don't understand why this movie was made. It's just a poor copy of other horror movies made years earlier. There was no originality in this movie. The story was just a poor copy of "The Monster Squad". This movie was made because it was cheap to make and the people involved thought they could make a quick buck. To put it nicely, this is a major pile of crap. There is nothing original about this movie. This movie was just made to make money. If you want to see a horror movie, I would rate this movie a two. This movie is totally worth the two dollars I paid to see it.

 The Monster Club is a completely forgettable romantic comedy. Most of the jokes don't land and the characters are not particularly likable (especially the rather annoying main character). The story is pretty standard for a romantic comedy, although the plot does have a few twists that are not always predictable. Overall, this movie is definitely not one of the better romantic comedies. It's also a little bit predictable and doesn't really have much going for it - the characters are not particularly likeable and the plot is rather predictable. I liked the fact that there were two different worlds, but the whole premise of the movie is a little bit silly. I found the movie boring and rather irksome, and this is coming from someone who really likes romantic comedies. I was hoping for more laughs and more romance, but we didn't get much of either. I also found the movie to be a bit too long, although I did find it to be a pretty good length.

<br /><br />I have to say that I didn't enjoy this movie. While the movie has some pretty good scenes, it is not one of my favorites.
 this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen..the only way i can describe it is like a cheap version of the matrix..the acting is terrible and the story line is not justified at all..the ending was extremely ridiculous and totally out of place..i was hoping it would end differently but it didn't..i couldn't even finish the movie. i thought it would be a lot less boring than it was...it was painful to watch...i don't recommend it at all..

i guess i got what i deserved, i ended up watching this movie. i think i should have watched it as a rental..

i am seriously disappointed that i wasted my time on this movie. i feel sorry for the people who actually thought this movie would be good..

but not me. it was probably the worst movie i've ever seen.

 This movie is one of the worst ever made and I have seen many, many bad movies. The story is lame and the acting is laughable. There is no logic, no flow and no idea on how to make a movie. I would have been better off sticking to watching the movie trash on TV.

I saw this movie with a friend who is a big horror fan and he turned to me and said "you know, I don't think I've ever seen a movie as bad as this one."

We decided to see it again and this time we were expecting something good, but it never happened.

This movie is so bad that it's good, but that doesn't make it a good movie.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it's that bad.

I checked it out at the library and I'm glad I did, I got my money's worth out of it.

I just pray that the next movie I see is at least as good as the last.

Another thing, I'm a fan of the horror genre and I've seen some bad movies but this movie was so bad I really couldn't believe it.

I'll never forget the first
 A film about a boy and a girl who fall in love but the girl is involved in a love affair with another man during a party. Also the girl's father is a pathologist who is the chief suspect in the murder of a woman he was dating. The film has seemingly no real plot or resolution to it. It's not even a "who done it" movie, it's just a series of events. The director wants to show how he can "push" the limits of what people will accept in cinema and this movie is a prime example of that. The film is also full of sex, which was probably the reason it got made in the first place. This movie is just a load of rubbish and the worst part is that very little of it is even funny. If you have the slightest interest in this film then I suggest you go to the video store and rent it.

 This movie was surprisingly good considering that most of the other movies on this list are awful. It's a very funny movie with a lot of good lines and scenes. I really enjoyed it and it was one of my favorites this year. It's a little bit like "Ghostbusters" in that it shows the public's fear of ghosts and the real life people who keep them from being too scary to people. The movie is set in the 90's when people were not afraid to talk about ghosts and life was not as scary. I also liked the fact that this movie was about a group of kids and not just an individual. The acting was great and the characters were funny. There was not much scary in this movie so parents can take their children if they want. I really liked it and I would recommend it to anybody who likes really funny movies.

 The first film in the series was by far the best and most watchable. The second film, though it had more of the same humour, was not as good. The last film of the series, however, seemed to be a waste of time. The film was not as funny as the first film. It was more of the same. It would have been nice if something new could of been added to the film. I mean, it was a movie about the old biker group that was the bad guys in the first film; it would have been nice if the bad guys could of been the good guys again. Other than that, the film was fine.

 The premise of the film is that a group of scientists is working on a way to make people live in the past, by traveling back in time, to kill Hitler and prevent World War 2. After being sent back in time, they realize that the people living in the past are barbaric, and decide that it would be better to just kill Hitler. After killing Hitler, they find out that the people in the future are also barbaric, and try to prevent them from killing each other. The science of the film is quite believable, and the acting is good. One of the problems with the film is that the plot is so unbelievable. The people in the future, who have been living in a time of peace, are worried that they are going to have to fight. Rather than arguing about it, they decide to just kill all the other people. Who would decide such a thing? Moreover, the film completely ignores that the people in the future would be almost completely wiped out by a war. The film also makes a number of other plot holes. For example, the people in the future know that Hitler is going to be killed, but they don't know how or when. And, the people in the future tell the people in the past that
 I feel like I'm the only one who's been able to see this movie. My friends don't get it. I don't get it. The title should be "Horseman." 6 people on a horse. <br /><br />So what if the plot is a little weak. The acting is so bad, it's funny. The special effects are so bad it's funny. But the plot is so weak, it's funny. <br /><br />The director, obviously a good director, knows how to make a good movie and a bad movie. He knows how to do both. And he does both. The movie starts out with a good pace, and a lot of comedy, but ends up being just a little too long for its own good.<br /><br />And it's not a good horse movie. It's not a good movie. I'm a guy and I like horses. I like to watch good horse movies. I like to watch a movie where I can enjoy the scenery. This movie was not that movie.<br /><br />This isn't just a bad movie. It's a bad movie with a good movie director.

 I rented the movie on @HBO, but wasn't able to view it because the cable was out. I watched the movie when it was on @HBO, and I have to say that this movie was very badly done. The movie looked like a home movie being filmed, and the acting was terrible. The music was annoying, and the story was very poorly told. I think that the concept was too much for the movie to handle, and they didn't have time to do the movie justice. I would have liked to see more of the story unfold, but that wasn't possible. I can't even begin to tell you how bad this movie was, but this was probably the worst movie that I have seen in a long, long time.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to watch the worst movie ever made. I gave it a 2 for the acting, but it got that because I didn't know what else to give it.

I am sorry to say, but I would never buy or rent this movie, and I wouldn't even recommend that anyone else see this movie.

I would give anything to see better movies than this, and I would say that this movie was
 I just saw this movie and I really can't believe that it won an award from the Venice film festival. It's an old fashioned "screwball" comedy. You are looking at a movie which is trying to be as funny as it can, but fails miserably because of it's lack of sophistication, sophistication and intelligence. I was a little shocked that the festival gave it a prize. Anyway, this is a movie that isn't for everybody. I would say that if you want to see a good screwball comedy make sure you rent "The Apartment", "Bringing Up Baby", "Meet Me In St. Louis" or "The Philadelphia Story", all of which are excellent comedies that have a lot more to them than just slapstick.

But if you like this kind of movie and you really want to see it go ahead and rent this one.

 I just finished watching this film, and it was a complete waste of time. I don't normally bother with these comments, but I was so angry and disappointed by this mess I had to say something.<br /><br />This film is a total rip off of the old Crocodile Dundee. It is a remake, but a very poor one. The only thing that is good are the parts where the Crocodile Dundee character is mentioned. Otherwise, it is painful to watch. The acting is awful, the script is terrible and the costumes are laughable. The only good thing about this film is that it was filmed in Australia and has a good soundtrack. So it does have a few redeeming features.<br /><br />It is a shame that this film was released, as a lot of people will have seen the original. But I would recommend watching Crocodile Dundee. That film is a classic and should be watched. This film is not.

 I was so disappointed with this movie. I went to the premiere tonight and was really excited to see the movie. The movie was awful. I went to the Q&A and everyone else was just as disappointed as I am. No one could explain why they made this movie or what they were trying to say. Don't waste your money on this one. I know there are millions of people out there that liked it and that's fine. I'm just one of those people that can't get past the bad acting, bad story and bad message. I would recommend that if you want to see a bad movie, you should see this. It will be worth your time.

<br /><br />I didn't like the movie because it was so bad. I think the acting was so bad, you could barley tell who was supposed to be who. The story was so confusing, it was hard to understand what was going on. The story about the son and the father was so confusing. The father was more concerned about the son's relationship with the father's sister, then the son's relationship with his own father. The story was so confusing and the actors were so bad that I couldn't understand what they were saying.
 I had to waste six hours of my life on this piece of crap. Why? Because it was the only way I could find to get out of the house. If I had the choice I would have wasted a lot more time. The movie is supposed to be about a guy who takes a bunch of his kids fishing and tries to teach them about life but the movie is so horrible its hard to stay awake. The dialog is so bad that you know that the actors are reading from a script. When the kids are in the boat practicing their catch phrase for the movie "We catch a big one" its unreal. The fishing scenes are almost unbearable to watch because the fish are so fake <br /><br />If your a family, or you have kids under 13 then avoid this movie at all costs. As I said before, I wasted six hours of my life watching this piece of crap. A waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of life.

 I was born in New York City and have lived there virtually all of my life. I have seen all the big musicals and know what is real and what is not. I am a comedian and know what is funny and what is real.<br /><br />The book "Once on this Island" is not real. It is a work of fiction, an amalgamation of parts of many different stories. I am not surprised the movie is bad because it is a poor story, poorly written and poorly done.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good quality movie with a good story, then see a movie that is real. Don't waste your money and time on a movie that is not.

2.0 out of 5 stars Ok, but not great. Format: VHS Tape This movie is the story of Tiana. She has a bad marriage. She leaves home to find out what she wants in life. She meets a handsome prince, and she falls in love. This movie is about how love can bring people together, and how life is simple when you don't have to worry about money or things to do.

I have seen the movie. It is not worth buying the VHS
 I was actually looking forward to watching this film for a long time. Finally, I sat down and watched it, only to be totally disappointed. The only thing that saved this film from making an absolute total of zero points is the fact that it was shot in 3-D. It's easy to see the potential for a film like this in the format, but the film itself is a complete disaster. I've heard people say that the film's writing was very good, which is why I gave it a chance. The writing was absolutely terrible. The film had absolutely no plot, and the one that it did have was set up very poorly. The characters were absolutely horrible. Not only do they have no depth, but they make absolutely no sense. One of the main characters that I was supposed to care about in this film was a man who was talking to a tree, it was so unbelievably stupid. The acting was also extremely poor. The two main actors did absolutely nothing to save this film. The only thing that kept me watching this film was the fact that it was shot in 3-D, in a theater where you can see the picture in 3-D, so it actually looks like 3-D, and it's not just
 I've never seen anything like this movie, but I don't mean that in a good way. I think it's the worst movie ever made. I don't know why I watched it. I have seen 4 movies which were much better than this disgrace. There is no plot, no story, no acting, no directing and no acting! Just a bunch of people in a neighborhood and they try to act like a family. That's it, that's the whole movie. I can't think of anything else, but to say that they try to act like a family. I can't believe that anyone actually saw this movie and liked it. I think that I might have been the only person who watched this movie. This movie is a piece of garbage. This movie sucks! I can't believe that anyone would pay to see this movie. I would rather watch paint dry. This movie is a waste of time and money. I can't believe that this movie got made. I want my money back. This movie is just awful. I think that I might get a refund and go watch paint dry again. Not this movie! I can't believe how bad this movie is. This movie is so bad. I can't believe that I
 I've been a fan of the Book of Illusions series since I was a little kid and I was hoping that this movie would be the one I would always remember. Unfortunately, it's the only one that I remember.<br /><br />The plot is very simple. The story begins with Emily, the daughter of a famous illusionist and a retired detective, who is doing research on magic and is looking for a missing person when she stumbles upon the story of her father. The illusionist is a very famous magician and he is not only a very talented illusionist, he also has a dark secret that he keeps hidden for years. When Emily discovers that her father was the one who killed a stage magician, she has to find out if the magician's death was himself or if it was something else. The only problem is that the magician was killed in the last act of a performance and there is no way to prove who killed him.<br /><br />The movie itself is not bad at all. The plot is very simple and the movie is more of a drama than a thriller, but it has a few good moments. The movie is not bad, but it's not good either.

In the end, I
 This movie is a real waste of time. The story is so stupid that i was looking for the end of the movie since the first minute. The acting is just so bad that you can't even call it 'bad'. The movie doesn't even have a plot, it's just a bunch of random scenes or fragments of scenes that doesn't even have a relation to each other. The only reason why i watched the full length of it is because of an actress that i really admired. She was in another movie of the same director, and i even liked that movie. I don't need to see her in a movie like this one.

The movie is so bad that i can't even think of a word of what to describe it. A waste of time.

If you want to see a bad movie that has a plot, go and watch 'The Wicker Man'. It's a great movie, and the story is well constructed. This movie is just a bunch of random scenes that don't even have a relation to each other.

I'll give it a 6 out of 10 because of an actress that i really admired.

 As far as I can tell the only thing this movie has to say about the subject is that it does not like it. I don't know about that. IMHO the show was never about gun control. It was about the misfit kids, who if they had been kids in any other town would have been run over by a truck. In the movie they are being run over by a truck. But there, they are just misfits. In the show they are misfits because they are beyond the pale. The movie is just a shot of the misfits walking around while the narrator talks about how much they can have done with their lives. There are no redeeming qualities in this movie. I saw it on cable and I am glad I did.

I really wish I could rate this movie lower. It is truly awful, but it's not so bad as to deserve a 0. The movie is just a long series of mean-spirited and badly-acted scenes, where the children are bullied and nasty to each other, and the only thing the movie has to say about gun control is that it doesn't like it.

 I don't know why I watched this awful movie. Maybe I wanted to see if the hype was true, maybe it was just to see what all the fuss was about. I was totally disappointed. The acting was wooden, the writing was bad, the characters were one-dimensional and the plot was not very original. I have never seen a movie that was so bad that it was unintentionally funny. The whole thing was just a disaster. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It would be like giving a kid a car-engine and expecting him to build a car. So don't waste your 8 bucks and don't waste your time.

I thought this movie was pretty good. The acting was great, the characters were believable and the plot was unique and new. The movie was also well written and was a very interesting story. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It was a very good effort and I would be very happy to see another movie like this in the future.

 This is a very bad movie. In the beginning, Mal (John Cusack) and his friends are all about to start a fraternity house. He is a slacker and the rest of the guys are trying to get him to join. He is pretty much ignored by his friends, but he still hangs out with them. Then his ex-girlfriend (Julianne Moore) moves back in with him and, as he says, "she just wants to have sex." Then a guy named Chris (Ben Affleck) who teaches him how to fight comes by the house and he wants to date her. Then, as Cusack says, "she wants to have sex." They have sex and he is not pleased with the results. She is not satisfied either. Then, one night, the guys get together outside of the frat house and they get really drunk. Then, as Cusack says, "she just wants to have sex." The next day, they all go to the beach and she is there. He takes her home and they have sex again. She is not satisfied again. He is not satisfied either. Then, he sees her at the beach again and he says, "she just wants to have sex
 There are so many bad movies out there. And so many that are just plain bad. I'm not saying that this movie is a good movie. I'm saying that it is bad. I saw this when I was young and I hate it to this day. If you have a brain, you will not like this movie. The acting, directing, and plot are all terrible. There are just so many things wrong with this movie. If you are going to watch, you should at least watch it in a theater because it is so bad. It is just one of those movies that makes you want to kill yourself every time you see it. I see this movie in the theaters once every six months or so. When I do, I kill myself. Also, if you are in a bad mood, it will make you feel worse.

A movie that makes you feel worse.

 I saw this movie at a theatre today, and was surprised to see it at all. It was on for only about 20 minutes. Too bad, because I was amazed that it had such a low rating. I thought it was pretty much a good movie, although a bit of a slow start. There are a few minor flaws in the plot, but they are easily forgiven. I thought it was very good. It had a lot of potential, but didn't quite live up to it. The acting is quite good, and the cinematography is excellent. All in all, I give it a 7.

 This is based on an old German film of the same name! Don't get me wrong, most of the movie was very watchable. But the story was not that good and the acting was so bad in this movie , it was funny!<br /><br />The movie starts out on a ship that is hit by a torpedo, while they are at it, another torpedo hits another ship, and when they get off that ship, they find a strange looking man named Jack (Ed Harris). He tells them that he was a spy and he knows where a German sub is and he tells them that he wants to go with them so that he can take it out. The rest of the movie is the story of this ship going out to find a German sub and when they find it they have to dive down to the bottom of the ocean to destroy it. Now the problem with this movie is that the story was so very bad and the acting was so bad, it was not funny at all. I want to know what in the world was going on with the German sub that made it's crew do the things they did? And did they really kill each other or were they just killed by the sub? <br /><br />
 This movie is a very bad movie, but I love it. The acting is great, everything is just so over the top that it's so funny. I can't even explain, if you have time and feel like you have to watch a bad film this is it. I would rate it a 10 if it wasn't for the poor acting of the characters.

5.0 out of 5 stars An old school 80's horror classic... Format: DVD ...One of my all time favorites. I've seen this movie at least 20 times and I always laugh at the acting. These guys are so over the top that it's great. The girls are beautiful, and they are all just acting like they are in a porn movie. I don't know how else to describe it. The plot is very simple and the acting is so over the top that it's great.

4.0 out of 5 stars I Like Bad Movies Format: DVD This movie is definitely not for everyone. I like bad movies. I love to laugh at bad acting and bad plot lines. I usually don't think too much of a movie until I see it. I watched this one for the first time about a year and a half ago, and
 I watched this film with high expectations. The story was very intriguing and I didn't see the ending coming. The acting was great. But that was where it ended. There was a lot of padding in between, and the end left me feeling cheated. The writer/director seems to be a big fan of Tibetan Buddhism, but he never really explains what it is. The characters are a little too simplistic to be believable, but it's a good story. It's a film that's worth seeing for its message, but there are better movies out there.

Hollywood films often do this, over-explain their message. The best films I've seen are those that have a great message, but are simple and direct. The best films are the ones that are more than the sum of their parts. And the best films are the ones that don't over-explain.

***

I felt the film was too long, and could have been shortened. I felt there was too much padding. It was very slow, which made the story drag. There were too many subplots, and they weren't developed.

The film didn't feel real. The characters and the setting were too
 I have no idea whether the show's intended demographic is teenagers or toddlers or what, but this show is just plain stupid. I can think of no other word to describe it, but stupid. I don't think I've ever seen anything as silly and unrealistic as this show. I would rather watch Looney Tunes than this garbage.

The show's concept is as follows. There is a twelve-year old kid named Eric Matthews who lives with his parents in a small town called Bayport. They have a two-story house, which is not very big, but that's okay. It's a house that Eric's dad built himself. The house's inside is enormous. If you walk into the living room and then turn to the right, you can see the kitchen and the master bedroom. If you walk into the living room, you'll have over twenty rooms to explore! This is impressive to anyone who has ever lived in a house. It's a pretty large house. Anyway, Eric's dad is a mechanic, which is a profession that apparently is very popular in Bayport. The mechanic's garage is visible from the living room. There's also a small basement in the garage. Eric's dad also has a rather
 A DVD of this movie is available in a lot of different versions. I owned the R1 DVD, but decided to get the R2 DVD, which has a better picture quality. I recommend it, because the picture quality is better, and there are more extras on the R2 DVD. The R1 DVD only has an audio track, and no extras at all. The film is about a woman who decides to spend Christmas in New York City, but on the way there, she is attacked by a man who rapes her. She returns home, but has become a victim of amnesia. She doesn't remember her attacker, her husband or her friends. She has a hard time coping with her new life, and she has to adjust to life in the city. The story is not very deep, but it's easy to watch. There is a lot of nudity and sexual content. I think it's a good film to watch under the right circumstances, but it's not a movie I'd recommend. I don't think it's very good, and I think it's not very realistic.

I don't see the point of this movie. It's a movie with a lot of nudity, but with no other substance to it
 I've been meaning to write this review since I first saw this movie, and it's taken me this long because I'm not really sure what to say. The movie is not bad, but it's not very good either. The acting is adequate and the cinematography is nice, though there is a bit too much of it. There's a bit of a problem with the editing, which I'm assuming is intentional, but it's a little too obvious, and it makes the movie seem overlong. The story of the movie is about a writer who has a very difficult time getting out of his hometown, and ends up getting involved with a woman who is from his hometown and wants him to write a book about it. The problem is that the movie tries to be subtle and heartfelt with its message, and it just comes across as being preachy. I don't know, maybe I just didn't get it, but that's what happened to me. All I'm really saying is that it's not a bad movie, but it's nothing special.

The End of the End of the World

8/
 This movie about a young girl's search for love in the big city is a big disappointment. It has some good actors (Brett Butler, Marianna Hill and of course, Hillary Swank) but they all seem to be more interested in the storyline, rather than acting. The movie is all about the story, which is, unfortunately, very predictable. The dialogue is weak, the acting is weak and the story is weak. There is one good scene in the movie, when Hill is trying to get back a ring that she won at a carnival, while riding on a unicycle. The scene is not only funny, it is also very touching. It reminds us of the old good movies, where the actors knew how to act, and where the story was good.

The only good scene in the movie is one where Hill is trying to get the ring back. It is a very interesting scene, for the simple reason that it is the only one that has any kind of story to tell. Hill is very convincing in this scene, and she is also very attractive, but the scene is not a good one. It is just a good scene to watch, which perhaps could be a good trailer for the movie. But,
 This movie is not "bad" per se, but it is not good, either. It's okay to watch once, but it's not a film that I'd want to watch again. There are a few elements that are engaging, but overall, I just kind of sat there and didn't care that much about the characters.

What I liked about the film is that it was a little different than the usual chick flick. It's also a good thing that the characters aren't overly stereotypical. And it's nice to see Tom Hanks in a different role than he usually plays.

Overall, I think it can be skipped unless you're a big Tom Hanks fan.

Tom Hanks plays an FBI agent who is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in a small town. The girl disappeared without a trace, and the police and the FBI are looking for some clues. The investigation is further complicated when Hanks' girlfriend (Amanda Peet) is also a member of the police department.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting, but the acting is what really sucked. The dialogue was pretty bad, and the
 This film is a complete waste of time. Completely unfunny and not worth the time to sit through. The plot is a complete mess, the acting is awful, the humor is weak and the plot is ridiculously convoluted. I watched it just to see if it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />This is the first film I have ever seen that was so bad that I couldn't think of a single thing to say about it to make it seem better. It's just bad. <br /><br />I can't believe people are giving this movie a high rating. I'm giving it a 2 out of 10 due to the fact that I can't think of anything positive to say about it.

Surprise, surprise. This film is just as awful as I expected. Some of the acting is OK, but that's about it. I found the plot to be confusing and not really all that funny. The jokes are well-timed, but they are few and far between. The only good thing I can say about this film is that it is short. There is no logic in this film. The plot is confusing and ridiculous.

 I haven't seen the full film, but the most important part of the story is spoiled by this sketch. The sketch is indeed very funny and is a part of the film. But it should have been in a different part of the film and not in the middle like this sketch. It makes the film more confusing and it is not as funny as it could have been. The film is still funny, but the sketch ruins the film. If you want to see the film, I suggest you don't watch this sketch and watch the film without the sketch.

**SPOILERS BELOW**<br /><br />The film is about a group of girls in high school and how they are dealing with their very first sex. They are having sex with boys because they are interested in boys, but most of them have no idea about sex. They are not interested in boys and they have sex with boys because they think that they are interested in them. They are not interested in boys. This is the first time they are having sex. But the boys are interested in them. Why? Because they are pretty and they are interested in them. The girls don't know that. They think that they aren't pretty
 There was more than one stupid thing in this film. First of all, the film implies that if you're a cop, you're automatically a good cop. I know a lot of cops, and most of them are bad, including the people portrayed in the film. Most of the officers in real life are racist and sexist, and that's not the way most real cops act. Secondly, the film suggested that if you're a cop, you're automatically an undercover agent. That is also not true. Most undercover agents are not cops, nor do they pretend to be. Thirdly, the film implies that if you're a cop, you're automatically a good person. No, most of the cops that I know are not good people, and this film never made them seem to be. The film is just insulting to the population of police officers in general.<br /><br />The film was just plain stupid. It's trying to be funny, and it fails miserably. If you're from the Police, you'll take this film as an insult. It's trying to be funny, but it's not.

 I don't know why they tried to make this movie, but the best way to describe this movie is "OK". It's not a bad movie, but I can't say I was a fan of it either. I haven't seen other iterations of this story, so maybe I'm a little tired of it by now.<br /><br />This movie is about a young boy who is taken away from his mother and sent to live with his father, who is a doctor. The boy becomes friends with a girl who lives in his new home, so he says goodbye to his mother and starts going to school. Then one day, he finds out his mother is coming to visit.<br /><br />There is nothing really wrong with this movie, but there is nothing really right with it either. It's not particularly thrilling, there are a lot of shots that leave you confused, and the rest of it is just boring. I remember being confused by the fact that the father's name was Charles, I couldn't figure out his real name until the very end.<br /><br />The acting was fine, the story was fine, the scenery was fine, and the setting was fine. But everything else was just kind of
 I found it very interesting that the movie, aimed at the youth of today, was made in 1989 and the director is an American who was born in the early 50s. I agree that the movie is not a masterpiece and is, in fact, quite boring. What is interesting about this movie is that, like so many Hollywood movies, it is all about the story, the characters, the relationships and the motivation of the characters. The plot is very simple and predictable. I thought the movie made a good attempt to make the moral of the story (about the importance of communicating with your father) clear. I also thought the movie was very original in using the conflict of the father and the son as the driving force behind the movie. This is not something, which I have seen in other movies. The movie thinks and tells what the characters are thinking and feeling, not what the viewers should think. This is a good thing for a movie to do. The actors' performance was decent. The only actor I was particularly impressed with was Charles Grodin as the father who, I thought, was very convincing. I also thought the movie, despite the rather obvious plot and predictable ending, was interesting to watch.

 I really wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't. The acting was terrible. And I'm not even going to go into the acting of the kids. I'm just going to say that I feel like I know Brian, Peter, and Paul. I've heard some of their music so I've seen their movies. My Uncle and my Mother love them. They are not very good. I just don't understand why so many people love them. It's not just me. I'm not the only one. <br /><br />I was disappointed. I had high expectations. I felt let down. I'm not the only one who feels this way. I wish there would be a better movie about the Beatles.

 I just had to see it. A friend of mine saw it and told me it was a comedy. Funny or not, it wasn't. The title of the movie is pretty much self evident.<br /><br />I have only one complaint - the title. It just didn't fit the movie. It made the movie sound like a love story and it wasn't. The acting was nothing to write home about. I guess they didn't have much money.<br /><br />All in all, I would say skip it and rent something better.

I loved the movie. I laughed the entire time. The people who hate on it are just plain wrong. I turned to my friend and said "You know, when you're laughing so hard you cry and you're holding your stomach, all you can do is laugh." It's a great movie. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

 I'd like to think that I have a pretty good sense of humor. I've seen far worse movies than this one and I've found myself laughing.<br /><br />But this movie is just too dumb. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not moving and it's certainly not scary. It's just... dull. The only thing it had going for it was the b-movie-ish plot. But that's a thin facade over an unwatchably bad movie. I'm not going to give it any stars. It's just not worth it.

<br /><br />I'm not even sure if I'd recommend it for young children. I think it would be best for a family that's not very sensitive to other people's feelings. I'd say it's more for a 13-17 year old that has already seen at least one other horror movie.

<br /><br />I think I'd rather see the gore and violence in the horror movies I've seen. At least I can predict those.

<br /><br />A simple plot with too many characters and a horrible ending. That's not a good recipe for a horror movie.

 This is not a bad movie. It's just not a very funny one. The characters are not well developed, the plot is weak and the dialogue is not funny. I was totally bored by this movie and I had to watch it in the hopes of finding something funny. It was not. The only time I laughed was when they were talking about the dog. My wife also thought the movie was boring. I feel this movie will appeal to the kind of people who like a lot of naked women. Oh, and I had to buy a copy of this movie. The reason is the nudity. If it had been a real movie I probably would have never bought it. The nudity is a big selling point in the movie. Bottom line: This movie is not funny and you probably won't either.

 I found this movie to be the most anti-climatic movie of the year. There are no plot or story line. It is just a bunch of random scenes thrown together. The acting is terrible, especially by the main actor Colin Hanks. I would never had guessed that Hanks was the same actor who played Bill Nye the Science Guy. The only good thing about this movie was the extras. I thought they did a pretty good job of portraying the characters they were portraying. The extras were much better than the main actors. If you want to see a good movie watch The Orphanage. I would highly recommend that movie.

 This movie is terrible. It's got the most laughable acting ever, and the plot is just awful. I mean, come on. It's a movie about a young man who, after an awful experience he had with a girl at a bar, spends the rest of his life as a hermit. Awesome. I mean, if that film was any good, I'd want to be hermit too. The acting is so bad that I can't believe that anybody would want to watch this movie, let alone get paid to do so. This is one of the worst movies ever made. It's not even a comedy. It's just silly.

I just wanted to know how a film like this got made and how they were able to find actors willing to star in it. It's not as if they have big stars. I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay money to watch this film. I'd rather go to the dentist.

 I saw this movie on Lifetime and was amazed how bad it was. I was thinking it was a spoof of The DaVinci Code, but it was most definately not. I have seen bad movies before, but this one takes the cake. It's so bad I couldn't believe I was watching it. I thought it was made in the 70's and it looked like it. The acting was so bad that I couldn't even stand it. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it did. The music was absolutely horrible. Don't waste your time and money on this one. Also, the cast was made up of actors that were way too old for their parts. The only redeeming factor about this movie is that I learned that it was made in the UK.

I loved the movie! It was made in the 70's by a British director! I loved the plot. I was going to watch it again, but I was too busy. I highly recommend this movie. I also think it may have been a spoof of The DaVinci Code, but I don't really know
 First of all, the movie is not really scary. It's more like a Rocky Horror Picture Show. In the beginning of the movie, a witch comes to the door of a young couple. The idea is that they're a young couple, and they live in a cottage out in the country. The witch goes inside and then, after a while, comes back out and says, "I smell something here that is not right." It's a good premise, and a good way to start things off. Then, the scene gets a little more interesting. The couple goes out to the field, and some weird things start happening, like the couple kissing and stuff like that. Then, the witch comes back out and says, "I smell something here that is not right." The movie then goes somewhere else. It's a little confusing, but it's interesting. Then, the movie gets into a classic horror movie story. The couple is in the woods, and they come across something that they can't tell what it is. It keeps changing, and they keep coming across it. It turns out that it's some kind of creature. The couple tries to get away, but it attacks them. The movie is pretty good. The acting is
 I have seen this movie once at a film festival. I really don't know how to describe it. I am almost sure that it is a parody of a horror movie. I don't know if there are any other movies about the horror genre that are this weird. I have never seen a horror movie that is this bad. In any case, if you like horror movies, please don't waste your time watching this one.

I have seen a lot of movies, and I have to say that this is one of the worst.

I think that it is a good idea to make parodies of movies, but this one just doesn't work. It really doesn't. I hope that this movie doesn't become a cult movie, because it really doesn't deserve it.

I would recommend this movie only to people who are not interested in the horror genre and who are truly desperate for a good comedy.

Rating: 1/10

PS: I have also seen a "straight" copy of this movie. I admit that the film itself wasn't that bad.

And it is a good idea. I have also seen a "straight" copy of this movie. Again, it wasn't that
 This movie really did suck... my wife watched it and she's a fan of the series, she said she couldn't stop laughing. I, on the other hand, was getting ready to have a stroke. The acting was awful, too. Basically, the movie was just a bunch of people saying the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The only good part was the fact that the movie was short. 1/2 hour was way too long.<br /><br />I'd rather watch the commercials for this movie than watch it again.

I'd seen the first four movies in the series and was dying to see the last one but my local library didn't have it. I checked online for it and found it for $4 on Amazon.com. It was definitely worth the money! The movie is a little long, but the characters are great and I laughed a lot! There was a lot of continuity in the movie and it didn't seem like they were trying to rush it. I liked the ending, too. I definitely recommend this to anyone who
 I thought the beginning was a bit too tragic with the character of Tom Cruise in the beginning as he was very convincing. I also thought that the acting was quite good, especially by the actresses. But then, like all the other movies of this genre, it took a different turn. I thought the ending was somewhat predictable, but that didn't necessarily spoil the whole movie. It was the same as in all other love stories, the girl loses her virginity, the guy loses his virginity, the girl becomes pregnant and then the ends up dying. The problem with this kind of movies is that they are very predictable, since the characters are always the same. I hardly ever get bored with a movie when I can predict the ending, so I was disappointed when I saw that the ending was predictable, especially when I was hoping for a very different ending.

The movie was very nice to look at. It had some very beautiful scenes. I also liked the music that was played in the background.

My overall rating for this movie is 7 out of 10.

P.S. The movie is pretty long, so I suggest you to watch it on a DVD, so you can fast forward through that part you don't like and
 I really didn't like this movie. The plot was extremely complicated, and was probably confusing for the audience (I'm not an idiot, but it took me a couple of times to figure out what was going on). The characters, especially the one that played the stepmother, were simply horrible. The one thing that kept me going through the film was the fact that the stepmother was played by Linda Blair. She's a great actor and I'd rather watch her than anyone else, but even she was poorly cast in this. Overall, I was very disappointed.

8/10.

**SPOILER ALERT**

The Stepmother was one of the worst, if not the worst, people I've ever seen. She was so evil and conniving that she had to be the best, or at least one of the best, villains of all time. She murdered her children and her husband and then framed her step daughter for it. It was pure evil.

1/10.

**SPOILER OVER**

(I still think it was Linda Blair, though.)

The Stepmother was one of the worst, if not the worst, people I've ever seen. She
 I have to admit, this movie was pretty funny. However, I did not laugh as much as I should have. I guess there was not enough backgrounding of the actors to really give a clear picture of what they are doing in this movie. This is a good thing though. It makes it so that the movie is kept light and fun. That way, even if there was not as much laughter, it would not be a total loss. If you are a fan of the original, I guess you would still enjoy this even if you were not a big fan of the sequel. I am not sure if you would enjoy the original, but if you did not, you may want to pass on this one.<br /><br />All in all, I give this movie a 4 out of 10.

Have you seen this movie? You can leave a comment about it below.
 This series is pretty well known for being full of clichés, but I think this one goes too far. We see the story of a family whose daughter (Christina) is murdered. Though we can't see it, the killer has slit her throat. Her mother (Judith) is shocked, but the family is too busy with the funeral to do anything. A few days later, the killer comes out of hiding to kill the sister (Tracy), who is unaware of what has happened. The killer is a hermit who lives in the woods, and he'll only kill women, so the family will be safe. It turns out that the killer is some sort of crazy serial killer that loves the feel of a knife in his hand. The killer is a little slow, so he can't be too dangerous. The family can't believe it, but they think it's all over. They even start to talk about getting together again. The killer comes out of hiding to make one more kill. The killer clearly enjoys his work and is having a good time. He's practically proud of himself. The killer is so giddy that he decides to make one more kill, just because he can. He even kills himself---and the
 I have read some of the reviews here, and I have to say that I completely disagree. This film is a beautiful, well-made, and powerful film, and I think it's important to stop and appreciate that. It is a film that pulls no punches, and it is not afraid to show the horrors of the '80s and of apartheid. It is a film that captures the indescribable. The acting is superb, and the cinematography is wonderful. The story is well-written, and from what I remember, I think it is actually pretty accurate. I saw it on the big screen at a film festival in New York City, and it was a very powerful experience. And to be honest, it was a pretty good ride. I mean, it's not a great film, but it's good enough to entertain, and it's good enough to make you think. I love it when movies do that.

It's a really good film for those with an open mind, and I think it's a film that should be appreciated, and not dismissed.

I give this film a 3/5.

And yes, I am also a full-blown white person.

 This film is a major case of "Direct-to-video" material. It's low budget, low production values and low content are obvious from the moment the disc is put into the DVD player. The story doesn't make any sense and it never looks as if the film's director put any effort into the project. The acting is pitiful and the script is not that great. The only redeeming value of this film is the theme song and that's only because it's by the same person who did the theme song for the TV show "Smallville". There's no reason to watch this movie other than to see the "Smallville" theme song. If you actually like the show and are excited to see the DVD, then you may have a few laughs out of this. But the other 99% of the movie won't be entertained.

As for the Blu-Ray version of the film, it looks okay (in my opinion), but nothing special.

My Rating = ** 1/2 out of ****

* The above was written by me after viewing the film and not seeing the Blu-Ray version.

** For the Blu-Ray version of this film I give it ** out of ****
 This movie was a disappointment. I was really looking forward to it after seeing the trailer, but it was not even close to what I expected. The acting was not good, the story was confusing, and the movie was far too long. This could have been a great movie, but it was not. I was hoping for more, but it was not there. I give it a 5, but I would give it a 1 if I could.

I would have to say that this movie was a disappointment. I would have to say that this movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The acting was just so bad. I was very disappointed in this movie, and I was looking forward to it, but it just fell short. I think this could have been a good movie, but it was not.

 I thought that this would have been a good movie to watch in the summer of '02. In light of recent events, they could have used this movie to show the people of America, how really stupid we can be at times. If this movie were to be released today, I'm sure it would be a huge hit. If a movie is about the loss of innocence and about the tragic effects of a tragic event, this would have been a great one to show the world. But since it was made in the '70's and the events in the US were not as traumatic as they are now, this movie was a waste of time and money. I really think that the only way the movie would have been successful, is if the main character were to have been played by John Travolta. As it is now, you are left with a movie that makes you wonder what they were thinking when they made this movie.

The plot is mediocre at best. The characters are not very believable. The acting is below average. I understand that this movie was made in the 70's, but there is no excuse for the acting and the lack of realism.

This isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. The
 This movie is so bad that it's almost a guilty pleasure. I'm sure there are many people that will say that they are a bit bored to death while watching it and then they will realize that they actually like it. The story is simple. A boy kills his father and his girlfriend and then tries to kill himself. All of the characters in this movie are just so simplistic. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is even worse. The only good thing about this movie is that you can actually see the actor who plays the boy who kills his father and his girlfriend. If it wasn't for him, I would have given the movie a 0 rating. Don't waste your time. You will only realize how bad it really is when you see it.

 I watched this at the beginning of the weekend, and it should have been a good one. The trailer was intriguing and the cast was pretty good. What a disappointment. Its all over the place, the acting is terrible, the direction is awful, and the story is so pointless. Its supposed to be about a woman who is sick and she is taking control of her own life and is making money and living a life. Yeah, right! This is supposed to be about her relationship with her daughter, but its about her obsession with her mother, who was a very beautiful women, who died in a car accident. Why? I dont know. I just don't understand. I'm usually into these kind of films, but this one is so bad, I can't even finish it. The ending is so over the top, and unbelievable, I just don't know what to say. I'm not even sure if I can rate it. * 1/2 out of ****

I guess the acting isn't bad, its just the film is so boring. I would have left after the first half hour. The only thing that saved it was the really good music. I give it a 1/2 out of ****
 I was lucky enough to be able to see this well-produced film back in the '70's when it was shown on the Folkways National Recording Label. The film has been released on DVD, but I think it needs to be re-released in a High Definition format. It is a good story, the acting is excellent, and the photography will make you feel like you are right there in the room with the people you see. The film is unique in that it is shot in color, and the people are mostly black, but the stories are old time tales that are more appropriate for all ages. The film has a bit of a graphic nature and I'm sure some might find it hard to watch, but it is a good story and well worth the time.

If you have ever read the book, it will be even more interesting. I have been looking for the book for a long time, and it is one of my favorite books and I know most of the stories from the film. The film is 55 minutes long, and if you read the book, it is about the same length. I hope this movie is re-released in a High Definition format and does well. I am now going to order myself on DVD
 This movie is so bad that I think it would make a great movie.<br /><br />This movie is about a girl who is the only one in her class who does not know how to play basketball and all the other kids start calling her big foot and other names.

Then the kids decide to make her a big foot.<br /><br />This movie is just one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I can not believe how bad this movie is.

This is not a movie that I would want to see at all. I think that this is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.

 The acting is horrible, the script is horrible. The plot is terrible. The special effects are terrible, the location is terrible. The whole movie is terrible. There is no excuse for this movie, even for a spoof. It is a waste of time and money. Do not even bother going to see it. It is not funny in the least, and it has no redeeming qualities except for the acting. But even that is bad. I give it a -10 out of 10.

 There are over a dozen good episodes of "Bewitched" that did not make the syndicated version. But I have a feeling they are going to leave these on the cutting-room floor. This is a very weak episode because it is just a rehash of things that have already been seen. The whole premise is that the main character, Samantha, is enamored with her secretary, and she does anything she can to get his attention. In fact, her mother and sister try to goad her into doing something she shouldn't.<br /><br />The humor is painfully broad and very old-fashioned. And the presentation is so stale that it is hard to get into it. It just seems like a mass-produced version of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" or "I Dream of Jeannie." There is nothing new or particularly interesting here.

1.5 out of 10.

What an ending!

In this episode, Samantha's boss at "Maidstone" is dating a woman named Carol, who has a daughter named Susan. Carol is a frustrated housewife who wants to be married to her husband, but her husband has a job that keeps him out of the house all day.
 The only good part about this movie was the cast. The rest was pretty mediocre at best. It had to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. I found it very hard to sit through the whole thing, but I felt I had to because I had rented it. I just didn't get what the movie was trying to say. I don't want to make too much of a big deal, but I was very disappointed with this one.

As far as actors go, I thought the cast was pretty good. The only guy who didn't do much was the lead guy. Since it was a pretty low budget movie though, I don't think they could afford to pay much money to the actors (which is a shame).

I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would say, rent it if you are a die hard fan of the genre, but otherwise, don't waste your time.

 I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I had seen the trailer and was a bit excited to see it. The movie doesn't make you feel like you're missing something. All I can say is that it's not a bad movie. I would have to say the best acting was done by Durell and the worst one by Milian. I feel that the movie could have been more drawn out. I think the movie has a lot to offer and I am only disappointed in the lack of imagination. I have seen movies like this before and this was not one of them. I was hoping for a more dramatic and thought-out ending. I think the movie would have had to have been extremely long to have really worked. I was not satisfied with the ending.

I would give this movie a 6 out of 10.

 I was so disappointed with this movie. There is not much humor in it. There is not much of a plot either. There is just a lot of characters that the audience is supposed to know. The only comedy relief was from a hearing impaired character. This movie was just not funny. The ending was ridiculous. The only thing that saved it from being a complete waste of time was that it was not boring.

 I agree with the other reviewers. This film is a big fat waste of time, and money. I like a good trashy horror movie, but this one is just plain boring. I watched this one at least three times and I still couldn't get into it. I found myself yelling at the TV, "Just stop already." Then I would turn off the VCR after that just so I won't waste any more time. I am hoping that I will forget about it. I am sure that you will never see this one again, so don't even bother renting it. If you are a fan, then you may want to check it out, but I wouldn't count on it.

Here are the main problems that I found with the film:

1. The story is completely stupid. Here is a guy who is trying to get away from a killer, but ends up being a victim. I mean, how stupid does that sound? The only thing that saved this from being a really bad movie is the acting. The main guy was pretty good. He seemed like a normal guy, and not a whiny, spoiled brat. The girl who played his girlfriend wasn't great, but she tried hard. The
 For a movie about a girl who has a crush on her teacher, the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed and just plain bad. This is one of those movies that you know is going to be bad from the second it starts.<br /><br />I would have given this movie one star, but I gave it a half star. The reason is that there was one good scene, and the rest of it was bad. The scene in question was when the girl was taking a bath and her friend who was in the tub with her was having a heart attack. The girl had to call her mother and tell her what was going on. In that scene, the movie did a good job of showing the girl's connection with her mother. She was trying to save her mother, but she couldn't rescue her.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was just plain bad. There was some stupid comedy, some sexual stuff and a bad ending.<br /><br />There are better movies out there to watch.

Horrible movie

Author: liz-thompson from
 This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I think the only good part of it is that it's short. Its just a bunch of random scenes put together. A guy gets a phone call from his dead wife, then he finds out that his wife died in a car accident. He goes to the funeral home and meets her sister, who is an alcoholic. The guy goes to his wife's grave and looks for some information, is killed by the sister, then dies and is buried. A guy is having an affair with his wife's sister. During a fight, the wife's sister accidentally shoots her husband. He goes to the hospital, then the wife's sister kills him and the police think it's the husband. The husband then finds out that the wife is still alive and is going to meet her. He then goes to his wife's grave, sees her alive and goes to get her. The sister kills the husband and then kills herself. The husband goes to the hospital, where he is told that his wife died of a tumor. He then meets the wife, who is now a stripper, who he had an affair with while they were both married. The wife tells him that she had an affair with his best
 I loved the first installment of "The Hangover" and was super excited to see the sequel. However, I was extremely disappointed with how this movie turned out. I know I'm in the minority, but I'm sure it's because I loved the first movie so much.<br /><br />Everything was so forced. One minute they were having a great time, and the next minute they were throwing each other around the room, fighting and screaming.<br /><br />Way too much of the movie is spent with them looking for a place to stay and fighting to get a decent hotel room. The first movie was so quick you hardly knew where they were. This one was very slow and you could tell that the director was trying to make it look like a comedy, but it just didn't quite work.<br /><br />I was disappointed that there was no naked chick in the movie. <br /><br />I never thought I'd say this, but the first "Hangover" was a much better movie.

My first horror movie experience

I remember watching that movie when I was about 10 years old. I liked that movie a lot and when i was about 21 years old i decided to watch it again and i was amazed at how good it was. I must say that it is one of the best horror films ever made. The movie is funny and has a lot
 I remember seeing "The Last American Virgin" in the theatre with my dad and being absolutely blown away. It is one of the best films I have ever seen and it was the first time I had ever seen a film as truly original. Now that I have seen "American Virgin", I wonder if it was really so original. <br /><br />I must say though, I liked this film more than I did "The Last American Virgin" and I even liked the title. I really did not want to see this film. I was of the opinion that it was only a film for the sake of the title. I was wrong. I thought that "American Virgin" was a good film and I did enjoy it, though it was not as good as "The Last American Virgin". I am glad that I did not know that I was going to see a sequel to "The Last American Virgin" until I had already seen it. I do not think that I would have had the same reaction to this film if I had known about it beforehand. <br /><br />I must say though, I thought that the cast did a pretty good job with the roles they were given. I thought that they did a good job with
 I guess I'm not the only one who thought that this movie was terrible. I'll admit that at first I was kind of hesitant to watch it, but after seeing some of the guys reviews I decided to go ahead and watch it. I was absolutely wrong. I can't imagine the people who love this film. How can you enjoy a movie about aliens that are so uninteresting. I watched a Sci-fi channel special about them and don't get me wrong they were interesting, but the whole film was so boring and the actors were so bad I couldn't wait for it to end. How can you watch a movie about a bunch of people that are so unlikable and such a bore to watch it? I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this garbage.

2/10

I want to rate it a 1 but for some reason I can't.

P.S. Guess what the special effects in this movie are the most boring special effects I've ever seen.

P.P.S. Why do they keep showing the credits at the beginning?

 I saw this movie based on the fact that there was a lot of hype about this movie. And it definitely didn't disappoint. This movie made me laugh so hard. And it was well done on the acting part. But it was so sad and stupid at the same time.<br /><br />The acting was great but the script was so bad. The movie could've been so much better but it wasn't. I can't believe how bad this movie was.<br /><br />The only reason I watched this movie was because there was a lot of hype about it.

I would have liked the movie to be longer, the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen and the storyline is so laughably bad that it's not worth it. For example, the climax of the film is when the lead character gets shot and the bullet goes through his leg and then through his neck. That's the climax? The movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it doesn't even make any sense. The only thing that was funny was when the lead character's dog saw the lead character's daughter, who was naked The acting was awful, the directing was awful, the editing was awful and the plot was awful. The only thing that was good was the dog, but even the dog is terrible. I would avoid this movie at all costs.

 This is one of those movies that is hard to watch but is worth it. This is a very slow, very scary movie that is really about growing up. I love this movie and watch it a lot, but I don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like to see really scary stuff.<br /><br />It's about a boy who goes to a new school and sees a dead body in a field. He finds out that his dad is a horrible doctor but tries to help him. I won't tell you how the movie ends because you'll have to watch it.<br /><br />This movie is great, but it's not for everyone so don't watch it if you don't like scary stuff. <br /><br />

Okay story, but the special effects are great. Author: Josh from Toronto

28 December 1999

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I saw this movie a few months ago and I have to say that I was not impressed. The story is nothing new, and the acting is pretty bad. The only thing I liked were the special effects
 It's a very odd film, which is described as a "comedy," but which is actually a rather dark film. It's a film which is supposed to make you laugh, but which really doesn't. It is a film which is supposed to make you think, but which doesn't really. It's a film which is supposed to make you feel anxious, but which really doesn't. In fact, it's a film which is not only disappointing, but which is also downright boring. The worst thing about it is that it is actually quite good, and well-made, but it's not for the casual moviegoer. It's a low-budget film, and there is just not enough money or time spent on it. I think that it is a film that most people will not like, and I think that it's just not worth watching. I think that this is one of the worst films that I've ever seen, and I've seen films by people who were never nominated for an Oscar. The only good thing about this film is that it is well-made, and that it has some interesting character acting, but apart from that, it's just not that good. It's a waste of time and hard
 I'm not sure if the title "Redemption" is a reference to the movie itself or the redemption of the stars. For me the story of Redemption was slow and boring with very little suspense and action. The acting was good but the story was too slow. We had to wait for the mid-way climax to happen where the movie picks up some speed. In the end the movie was really slow and maybe too much dialog. I would say if you want to see a good movie that is as good as or better than "The Fugitive" or "The Fugitive" this is not the movie for you.

 I found this movie to be a complete waste of time and money. I saw it twice and I still can't understand why anyone would want to see it. I guess I wanted to give it a chance, hoping that I would eventually see something compelling about it. Unfortunately, I didn't. The movie was boring and only about 10 minutes long. The plot was uninteresting, and the acting was poor. I can't even remember a single line from this movie. While the movie was interesting in that it was so short, it wasn't worth the money to see it twice. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I would not want to watch it if it were free on television. I think this movie was made by non-professionals and that it is nothing more than a very poorly written and acted movie. The plot was nothing more than a man moving to a new city, getting a job, and meeting some people. It was more of a script for a bad sitcom than a movie. I don't think anyone should waste their time or money on this movie. I would have been more interested in seeing a cat try to figure out how to get into a locked car. I don't even remember who the main
 I remember there was a game show where they gave away tickets to BAND AID. I assume they did it in the late 80's or so. I remember watching this show and being impressed with the contestants being able to perform such a feat. I thought it was amazing and was hooked. I really wanted to see this concert so I went to see it. The movie was terrible and the songs were corny. I would not recommend it to anyone.

<br /><br />Comment from the owner: I am sorry you did not have a good time. There was a lot of dancing and I don't remember any lame dancing, but maybe it wasn't in the movie. I understand how the show can be a bit much at times, but please don't be a jerk. I would recommend you go see the movie instead.

<br /><br />Me: i did see the movie and i really wanted to see the concert. i would have given this a 2 out of 5 but i gave it a 1 out of 5. also for the next time you do this movie please have a good time and know what you are doing.

<br /><br />Comment from the owner: You
 Terrific acting, terrific costumes, gorgeous sets, an excellent script, and an amazing story, but director Anthony Minghella's film is just so dragged out and dull. The "love story" was well-done, but the rest of the movie was incredibly slow and plodding. You could tell that Minghella was trying to force a "magical" turn of events at the very end, but it just felt so forced, as if he was trying to make up for all the time that he spent on the rest of the film. I am going to give the film another chance, but I'm not very optimistic. I know that this is Minghella's first film (he's a playwright), but it feels like he's trying too hard to be "artistic" in this piece.

<br /><br />The story is about a young woman (Cate Blanchett) who flees her German "husband" (Gerard Butler), who is a soldier in World War II. She flees to the countryside, where she meets a farm hand (Robert Carlyle) and two other farmers (Peter Mullan and Aidan Quinn). After the war, the men take the farm
 Although I have to say I enjoyed the first one, this movie is a joke. It's not scary at all, it's just not scary. The same thing can be said about the second one. The third one is just as bad as the first one and the second one. They're all just so repetitive. The thing that I hated most was the ending. I don't know if it was supposed to be funny or what, but it was just so stupid. They had this huge battle, but they all just sort of wandered off into the woods. I know the ending was supposed to be a joke, but it wasn't even funny. I'd have much rather seen the characters have a big fight, than have them just wander off into the woods. I'm not saying that I didn't like the movie, but it wasn't even scary and it was just really stupid.

7/10

**** out of *****

P.S. I forgot to mention the first one. It was very good, but I didn't like the ending at all.

P.P.S. I also forgot to mention the Halloween H20 movie. The first one was great, but I didn't like
 I've heard that this is a comedy. I laughed once. That's it. This is the most unfunny comedy I have ever seen. The only reason I kept watching was because I thought I would be more likely to laugh if I knew what was going to happen. That, and I thought it might get interesting at the end. It did not. The only thing that could possibly make this a comedy is that the jokes are so bad you can't help but laugh. I mean, I laughed after I found out that the main character was a chimpanzee. I didn't even laugh at the punch line. That's how bad it was. There is no way any real person would laugh at this movie. I'm a young guy so I still have some semblance of hope for the future, but this was worse than that movie about the idiot and the cop. The only reason I didn't give it a zero is because I kept watching and I kept hoping that there would be something worthwhile at the end. Oh well.

I didn't like this movie so I don't know why anyone else did.

 I just finished watching this movie and I hope others are as disappointed as I was. I was expecting something good but got a couple of hours of boredom. The first half of the movie had some interesting scenes but then things went downhill. I think the film suffers because it is so unrelated to anything else I have seen. There are scenes of horror, gore and (to my mind) gratuitous nudity which are far too often and when they are not they are cheap to look at. The acting is not good, the story line is lame, the characters are not well developed, the dialogue is banal, the soundtrack is bad and the sound effects are completely stupid. All in all this movie is an insult to the genre it is trying to be. The only thing that saves it is the fact that there are a few good scenes, but that is not enough to make it worth watching.<br /><br />My advice is to stay away from this movie. If you are curious to know what I think about it I can only say that I give it a rating of...

 This movie is a complete disgrace. And I know it will be hard for some to get past the dated and sexist monsters and leather, but the way this film is put together is nothing but a hack job. The director seems to have been given an idea and then some story elements and then he just slapped it together. This is definitely a home video release and the picture quality is horrible. I watched this movie because I loved the idea of the film and because I thought it would be a fun monster film. The acting was bad, the pacing was bad and the effects were bad. I couldn't even find a point where I laughed. The only redeeming qualities were the creatures and the fact that there was some gore thrown in. Horror films are supposed to be fun and entertaining. But this film accomplishes neither. The only way I can give it any points is because it has two of my favorite monsters. (The Mimics and the Mimic Queen.)

 I have to admit, this movie is not as bad as I thought it would be. It is well-made, but that is all. There is no dialogue, and it's not scary, either. It is just a pointless and muffled mess of grainy images. The end result is a film which does not represent the original story, and makes no attempt at being scary. It's like a complete case of the vapors. I would say it is a 5.5 out of 10, but since it is so pointless, I'll give it a 0 out of 10.

I saw this movie on VH1 the other night. I was so disappointed I almost threw the remote control out the window. I had heard great things about this movie, and was excited to see it. I had to leave after the first 20 minutes because I was so irritated. I love scary movies, but this is not one of them; it is a downright bore. The people in the audience were also very restless. The whole
 This film was not even worth watching. I was so bored I kept falling asleep because it was so incredibly boring and slow. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but it was just a disaster. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the fact that it was on a plane, and I found it amusing to watch people fall asleep on a plane. I wouldn't waste my time on this film again if you're a UFC fan.

2.0 out of 5 stars Actually, this movie is surprisingly slow and boring. I would have given it a 1 if it were not for the fact that this movie is actually funny.<br /><br />This movie is actually about the USAC racing series. However, the movie was so boring, slow, and I couldn't care less about the characters. If you want to watch a movie about a race car being built and a driver competing in the race, look elsewhere. This is a terrible, terrible movie. Although it is actually funny in spots, the movie is so slow that it is impossible to get through. I swear this film was made to torture us. I found myself laughing so hard I almost fell asleep!

 Believe it or not, this is the first time I've seen this movie. I checked the reviews and saw it was only a 2.5 out of 10. I figured I'd give it a shot. What a mistake. If you ever have the chance to see this movie, go ahead and see it. You'll be glad you did. As far as I can tell, it's all a bunch of red herrings. It's like the writers were given a list of things to put in and just went with whatever could fit.<br /><br />Basically, the movie starts out with this group of kids who are looking for something to do. They find an old deserted house with a dead guy in it. They decide to steal stuff from the guy, and then they run into a tree-sitter named Jim. Jim is a hippie, you see. He's also a loner, and he doesn't like people. He's been living in the woods for years, and he's about to be evicted.<br /><br />The tree-sitter, Jim, eventually agrees to let the kids stay in the house with him, and they settle in for a long winter. Anyway, they find out
 The plot is quite obvious. The acting isn't good. Even the demons are almost too cartoon-like. I won't even go into the direction of this film, since I can't even begin to describe it. It's not just bad, it's awful. If you're watching this for any kind of enjoyment, you're wasting your time. I don't know how it got made, or how it even got released, but it shouldn't. I hope the cast and crew burn in hell.

I agree with you, but I like this film too. I wonder what the plot was, if the people in the movie were real or not? I think it's real, because I've seen people like that in real life, and I have a friend who is like that. I don't think I would have done anything like that. I would have just gone to the police and reported what happened. But hey, I'm not saying that I think it's real, I'm just saying that it's a possibility.

I don't know if the film was real or not, but it was a great film. I just watched it
 This movie was terrible. It was so awful that I felt pity for the actors, which is a feeling I have never had for actors before. The acting was so bad it was laughable. What a waste of time and money. I suggest you watch a comedy instead of this. It is the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am not sure who it was that did the script, but he should be ashamed of himself. Major kudos to the one person who tried to watch this movie and had to leave in the middle because of how bad it was. That person is not a very nice person.

1.0 out of 5 stars This movie is so bad that I am sure it was shot by an amateur. Format: DVD I know I am in the minority, but I am not one to give bad reviews. I am the sort of person who thinks that if a movie is worth seeing, then it is worth seeing. If a movie is worth seeing, then you should be able to see it on DVD. I am always looking for a good movie to watch. I have not seen The Women or The Spy Who Loved Me. I have seen the remake of The Manchurian Candidate
 The premiere of this movie was on the "A" list of the "A" list of the "A" list of the "A" list, and no one cared. It was the last movie that we saw, and there were only three people in the theater. The movie is not a good one, but it was so bad that it was so bad that it was good. Good bad movie. The directing was very good, and the acting was good. The whole movie was not an original story, but it was written well and the script was interesting. The movie did not have any special effects, but it was good because it was a movie, so the actors had to use their imagination and the camera to make it look good. If this is a sign of the future of movies, then the future is not looking good.

What a great film to end the year with! We had a lot of fun at a midnight showing at the local movie theater. I've seen it a few times now, but it is still fun to watch. My wife and I were both laughing at the same parts of the movie, which is
 I have to say that I was under the impression that this was a sequel to "Bicentennial Man". It's not. It's a remake of the original. And it's not even a good remake.<br /><br />This movie is terrible. It's the least entertaining film I've seen in a long time. I couldn't even finish it. I was so bored. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it isn't funny. It's supposed to be romantic, but it isn't romantic. It's supposed to be a sci-fi movie, but it's not that either.<br /><br />You'd think with a premise like this that there would be some interesting things to watch. But it's a complete waste of your time.

The original "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" was laugh-out-loud funny and very enjoyable. This new version is also funny, but unfortunately it doesn't feel like it's as fresh or original as the first one.

 This movie is so bad. I can't believe a director like Woody Allen would waste his time making such a boring, unfunny, unfunny movie.<br /><br />It was actually pretty hard to watch this movie as it was only about 30 minutes long. I tried to watch it with my friends but we all hated it so much that we just watched it by ourselves. I didn't laugh once and when I did it was only because of the laugh track. I am in no way saying that Woody Allen can't direct. I think he's a good director but this was just so bad. I was actually disappointed, so much so that I actually decided to write a review and I feel that I would be wasting my time if I didn't rate this movie 1 star.

 I finally saw this movie and it was awful. The actors were terrible, the plot was like an episode of the Twilight Zone, it was just awful. I saw it because of the hype, but the hype turned out to be a joke. I haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time, I hope it doesn't happen again.

 I was really excited to see this movie, I really like the sound of it and I really think that it has a lot of potential. Then I saw it. I think that it is more of a cartoon than a film. It is very poorly made, very poorly written and the characters are very stupid, the only one I liked was the sub-villain and that is ONLY because he was funny, the rest of the characters are stupid, the story is awful and the romance is bad, the sets are very cheap and the actors are not good, the only one that I liked was the girl in the front who was very pretty. I think that this movie should be taken off from the internet.

The story is about a bunch of high school kids who are taking an exam for the next round of a competition about the government. They are all competing for a role in the big city so they can be rich and famous. The kids are training in the woods and they are going to a huge party to celebrate the exam. The problem is that there is a virus that turns normal people into zombies and the only way to cure them is to drink blood. When we meet our main characters they are all on the way to the party
 I was waiting for this movie to come out since I heard it was going to be a comedy and a horror movie. I don't know what I expected from this movie but I was not impressed with it at all. I didn't laugh once and the horror scenes were pretty boring. It was pretty much a comedy about a normal guy who is attacked by a zombie wolf and has to fight for his life. I was expecting some gore but there wasn't any. I didn't even like the movie. I think it was the worst movie I have ever seen. I am really disappointed at how bad it was.

I am a huge horror buff and I expected a lot more from this movie. The story was just plain boring and drawn out and the acting wasn't that great either. This movie is definitely not worth watching.

I am very disappointed in this movie and I don't recommend it to anyone. I am very glad I didn't pay to see this movie.

I give this movie a 1 out of 10.

 I read a lot of reviews and saw a lot of comments on the net about this movie. Some said that the acting was good and I have to agree. I also read some comments about the story, but I can't comment on that because I have not seen it. <br /><br />The movie starts off with a pretty bad acting experiment by a dwarf. I have a few problems with this movie. It is not funny, probably because the main character is an angry and bitter man who lives in a world with no logic. The movie is also very predictable. For example, I knew that the movie was going to end with a dream sequence, because I was expecting it. <br /><br />It is not a bad movie, it just doesn't achieve it's goal. There are better parodies out there like The Naked Gun, Airplane and others. I think the main character was good, but I don't think he was the funniest. The rest of the cast were also pretty bad, except for the dwarf. <br /><br />So, my advice is: Watch it, it isn't bad, but it is not a great movie.

 From the director of the intriguing "A Question Of Silence" comes this foreign horror film. The plot is simple and not even that good. A doctor has a young daughter. One night she is locked in a room by her father, who then kills her. The girl's soul, however, continues to haunt her father, who believes that she is still alive. The doctor and his wife desperately try to find out what is going on, but to no avail. The only person who does understand is a doctor who was once a student of the man. The only other person who knows about the girl is a young girl with psychic powers. She knows what is going on and tries to help, but is she really helping or is she helping herself? The movie is not bad, but it is far from good. It is a bit slow, and the plot is not the best. The acting is not the best, the script is not the best, and the whole thing is not the best. The girl's sense of self-preservation is annoying, the mother is not at all creepy, and the only one who gets the girl's attention is a doctor who really needs it. The rest of the film is about the doctor trying to save
 It is a shame that we can be so influenced by the fashion of the day, and by the desire to get our own way, that we can be so quick to judge a work of art. The fact that this film was made as a re-make of "The Man Who Would Be King" was a bad enough reason to dismiss it from the outset.<br /><br />The film itself is not a bad film, and it's certainly an entertaining one, but it is a film made to please the masses, not to tell a good story or to make an insightful comment. It is a film made to entertain, and to be entertaining, it has to be a bit silly. As such, it is a film that is seriously lacking in that respect. It's not even a very good film. It has all of the necessary ingredients to make a good film, but they're just not used properly. It's not a bad film, it's just a film made to please the masses, and therefore it is a film that is lacking in certain respects.

It is a shame that people are criticising the quality of the acting. It is a shame that people are criticising the quality of the film. It is
 This movie is supposed to be a remake of the movie "The Mummy" but it's just a poor excuse of a remake. This movie is just a bad copy of the original. It's not even scary. It's a waste of time. The characters are bland and the story is boring. There's nothing happening in this movie. It's a pain to watch. This movie is boring. There's not a lot of gore. Just a bunch of people running around while a mummy tries to kill them. It's just not my cup of tea. This movie is very forgettable. It's not a good movie. There's no atmosphere. There's no suspense. There's no horror. This movie is just a waste of your time. You won't like it. It's really dull. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects. This movie is about a mummy that is trying to kill people. The mummy is played by Tony Amendola. The mummy is also shown in some flashbacks. The flashbacks are very well done. There's a few good things about this movie. I mean it's not a bad movie. But compared to the original it's just a ripoff. It's a waste of time
 I saw this film in the late 80s, and had to fully explain to my friends what it was about. As it turned out, they had never heard of it either. This film was a made-for-TV version of a novel, it was a typical movie of the 80s, a "dance movie" with a romantic interest and an evil villain. It is a little odd, considering the fact that most of these films were made before the advent of AIDS. For those of you that were there, you could understand how the film's plot could have been seen as an allegory to that horrible disease. The film was nothing more than a cheaply made movie with a plot full of clichés. The only thing that could have made this film terrible was the acting. There was one actor in particular, who played the lead, who had no business acting in a movie about a gay character in the 80s. I can't remember his name at this point, but he was the one who played the lead. He was about 30 years old and he was not believable in the role at all. Another actor who was in the film was Robert Pastore, who played the villain. Another actor's name that I can't remember
 I will start off by saying I have seen all of the seven "Scream" movies, and this is my least favorite. The plot was very predictable, the characters were all stereotypes, and the acting was terrible. The best part of the movie was the opening credits and the very end scene. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is the worst of the seven. I also feel that "Scream 3", though not as good as the first, is a better and more enjoyable movie. I believe that the only redeeming quality about this movie is the opening credits, which are awesome, even in the original version.

I was disappointed when I saw this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone.

 This movie was so incredibly bad, that I just don't understand how anyone could have thought it was funny. The comedian in me wants to give this movie a pass just because it is so bad, but the movie-goer in me says no way. It's so bad, that it's actually funny. And it's so bad, that it's one of the most ridiculous, awful, awful movies that I have ever seen. The movie is just plain bad. The acting, the script, the set design, the cinematography, the editing... It's all just so bad that it's laughable. And the fact that so many people have given this movie a good rating really makes me wonder how they could have thought it was funny.

I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so bad, that it was actually funny. It's definitely a case where you have to be in the right mood to watch this. I'm sure that some people will find this movie hilarious, but for me, it was just so bad, that it was actually funny. It's a classic case of bad movie meets bad comedian meets bad audience.

<br /><br />The movie opens with a bunch of people
 The movie is a waste of time. Most of the people in it are not really likable, and even the ones that are, are not real believable. The love interests are better in the books, the book showed how the characters developed and changed, but the movie does not. It seems more like a casting call for the book, rather than a movie. I can't imagine that anyone who has read the book would have gone to this movie. They should have made it so people who have not read the book could enjoy it. They could have done a better job.

As a background, I have read the book and watched the movie, and it is impossible to make them so much different. So, I wish there was a way that they could have made the movie so that it would have been the same as the book, but the characters would have been the same in both. I think that would have been much better for the book.

The book was about how the main character, Brian, dealt with his parents' death, and how he developed into an adult. The movie did not show any of that. It was just about the love interests. The movie should have been about Brian's development as an adult
 After seeing this film, I felt a bit disappointed, as I had hoped for a better film. It's a pity that the actors, who had been chosen for the film, did not get the chance to give their best. The film is not bad, just not very good. The story could have been written by Ingmar Bergman. The movie is really quite boring, and I had to force myself to continue watching. <br /><br />The characters have been written with a great deal of beauty, and I would have loved to have seen them acted by more experienced actors. The atmosphere is quite dark and the film is quite slow. <br /><br />I would have liked to see more of the characters, and I would have liked to hear more of the songs, which are beautifully sung. <br /><br />The film is not a bad film at all, and it probably would have been a lot better had the actors been better. The film is probably too long, and I couldn't do it justice by just saying that the film was boring or that the film was not very good. <br /><br />I give the film 2 out of 10.

 Not even sure what to say about this one. It's bad. I'm not even sure it's worth writing about. The DVD that I rented from Netflix wasn't even in proper shape. Some scenes were skipped and others were reordered. It was on a very cheap label. It is also VERY short. I was already in the "I'm going to give it a shot" mood and I gave up after the first two minutes. I'm not usually a huge fan of horror movies but this one was awful. I would never recommend this to anyone looking for a good horror movie. If you want to know what I think, it's really just a big cluster of nothing. I think it's a good idea to write down your thoughts/opinions after watching a movie so that you won't forget. I didn't write anything down after watching this one. I just remember I was disappointed. The only thing I really liked was the acting. The rest of it was bad. I'm not even sure why I wrote this down. I'm not even going to delete this entry but I just wanted to make the point that I didn't like it. I think I just never got into it. I was expecting a lot from
 I was disappointed in all of the ads for this movie. From the previews, I believed it to be about a young boy who was trying to get his father's approval, and it turned out to be just the opposite. I liked it but I found the scenes a bit confusing.

I thought the acting was nowhere near good enough and the whole story just seemed a little confusing.

The ending was good though, I liked it a lot.

I don't know. I liked it and I also liked it but I didn't like it.

This acted as if it was made by the same people that made "The Sixth Sense", "Signs", "The Grudge", "The Ring", and the "Fight Club" films. The acting was horrible and the whole story didn't make sense. The only thing I liked about it was the ending, it was nice. But the whole story was so confusing. And there was no explanation on what the story was about. I don't know if I would recommend this movie to anyone.

i must say i
 This movie is a complete joke. This movie does not even deserve a negative rating. There is absolutely no plot or story line to this movie. The only reason I gave it a zero was because I actually went to see the movie. The movie itself is hard to watch and it is a waste of time. The movie is set up to make you feel sorry for the main character, but you will never feel sorry for him. He is a bad person and he does things that are wrong and will always be a bad person. This movie is a waste of time. Don't watch it.

 TOUGH RACE is a film that should have been great. It is the story of a blind racer, Travis Hinton, and his new sighted team mate, Terry Gibson. There are two other racers in this film, but they are never seen again. The two don't get along, but the film tries to make it look as if their differences are real, based on their personalities, not because of their skill.<br /><br />The film is directed by the great Jack Smight and the photography is by the great Gerry Fisher. A lot of the film is shot in black and white, with a few "color" scenes. The photography is very good, and the film is shot with a lot of nice angles. Smight's direction is very good as well, although he tends to have the camera on the racer during most of the film. The problem is, the film is a bit too long, and you get the feeling that it could have been cut down by 30 minutes. It is also very slow moving. I think it is a great shame that the film was not commercially successful. The film is worth watching, but it is hard to say if it will appeal to a large audience. I think
 I was a fan of the first two films in this series. The first was a bit slow at first and the second was a tad bit of a "so what" story. All that changed in this installment. This film was brilliantly paced and the story was absolutely riveting. I'm not sure what happened here, but I'm hoping that it was the change in directors. This film was one that really held my interest. I really couldn't stop watching.<br /><br />The acting was top notch. The entire cast brought their A-game. The only real flaw was the score. It was a little bit too "hollywood" for me. I'm pretty sure that I saw a couple of the same notes being played during the action sequences. However, I still enjoyed the music. The rest of the music was good. I don't know if I'd put any of it on my playlist, but it didn't get annoying. The music was well done.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the story in depth. I don't want to give anything away. I will say this though. It's a very dark film, but it also has some light moments. I liked that. I
 It's not easy to define what makes a movie a good one. The plot, the actors, the cinematography, the music, the direction, the editing, the special effects, the writing, the messages, the direction of the message, etc... all those things play a part of it.<br /><br />In the case of this movie, it was the part of the directing of the message. If you look at the movie and read the synopsis, you might think that this is a horror movie, but it isn't. If you look at the movie, there is a very small amount of scary elements. The movie is mainly a mystery, and it's the mystery which makes it a good movie. If you look only at the storyline, and the way the movie is shot, you won't like it (I just don't see how anyone can watch the movie without feeling bored or annoyed). If you look only at the ending, you might think that there is something good about the movie, but if you look at the rest of the movie, you'll find that the ending was a result of the director's personal opinion. At the end of the day, this movie is a mystery and it's the mystery which makes
 This movie is a boring and weird story about a guy (Justin Timberlake) who is sent back to earth to make money. It is not really a happy movie because he is not really a nice person. It is a very confusing movie because they are not really sure what they are trying to say. The story is very hard to understand and the characters are not very interesting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

 Like most people, I have seen a lot of movies. I have seen a lot of bad movies. I have seen a lot of movies in which badness is the primary goal, but this is not one of those. This is a very, very bad movie. I have seen worse movies, but never with such a shameless disregard for the audience's intelligence. One could watch this movie and think it was a documentary on the life of a mentally disabled person. All of the supposedly "real" people in this film are almost completely unintelligible. The only people who are even remotely credible are the ones who were hired to play the part of the mentally disabled people. Some of the most "real" people in this film (i.e., the ones who are supposed to be the most normal) are portrayed in the most repulsively way by the filmmakers. This movie is so bad that it is impossible to watch. I would not waste any more time watching this film. It is not worth it. I will never watch it again. I have seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing that is as bad as this. I have seen a lot of bad movies. This is the worst.

(spoiler alert:
 The premise of this film is a really great one, but the execution is weak. The acting, script, etc. are all very weak. I'm sure it's a good idea to write a film like this and make it work, but it just didn't. The film just seemed to drag on and on and you didn't care what happened. I mean, I'd seen the movie twice, and I think each time it just got worse. I'm more interested in the "real" story behind this film than in the film itself, but it does make for a good film to watch.

I guess the acting was alright, but if you're going to do this, make it believable. I was expecting so much more.

 This movie is incredibly unoriginal, and you're really not going to enjoy it if you're expecting a movie like "Highlander." This movie is a complete rip-off of "Highlander," but with a more horrible quality. I wasn't expecting anything special out of it, but I found this movie boring and unrealistic. There are a couple of bad guys in this movie, but it's not really the bad guys that bother me, it's the fact that the characters in this movie are just so boring and uninteresting. I like movies to have interesting and intriguing characters, in order for me to be interested in the movie. After watching this movie, I could have cared less about the main character. I got no sympathy for him, nor did I care about him. The actors in this movie are just not very good. I've seen better performances in a high school play. The director should have taken some lessons from the other "Highlander" movies and make this movie more interesting. I know that it has a very low budget, but I think they could have done a bit better with it.

Cheezy and terrible

<br /><br />This movie is awful
 I am a big fan of Rob Zombie's previous horror/satire film, "House of 1000 Corpses". I have even said that I love it and have watched it over and over since its release in 2003.<br /><br />I am also a fan of "The Devil's Rejects". This movie was a bit of a disappointment. The original "House of 1000 Corpses" was a blast and this one, not so much. The story is pretty weak and the acting, in my opinion, is the worst it has ever been in any of Zombie's films. It is like watching a group of amateur actors perform. The idea for the movie was good but the execution was awful. I am not sure if Zombie didn't have enough money to make the movie in the way he wanted or if he was just trying to make a cheap scare flick. Either way I think this movie should have been a lot better. If you like Zombie's previous work you will probably like this one too but I don't recommend it if you are looking for a good horror film.

 I didn't like this movie at all. I've never seen any of the other movies in the series, but I was willing to give this one a shot. I was expecting it to be another cheesy, borderline bad movie about vampires that would have a few laughs but nothing that good. Instead this movie was terrible. The acting was terrible. Even the funny parts fell flat. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that it was on the Sci-Fi channel. The movie would have been almost unwatchable if it wasn't on the Sci-Fi channel where I could turn the sound off if I wanted to. I was very disappointed that the movie was not good. I hate to see a good movie waste its time being on the Sci-Fi channel. If they really wanted a good movie they should have replaced it with something that was actually good.

1/10.

I would give it a -3 if I could.

 The title is misleading. This is not a "B" movie. There are no cheesy special effects, and no OTT, over-the-top characters. The acting is mediocre at best, and the storyline is a bit too involved to be called a "B" movie. A casting director from Australia sent a copy to a friend of mine in the States, who thought the movie was funny and original. I did, too, at first. But after the first half hour, I was so bored that I almost put the DVD in the trash. The only reason I kept watching was that I was hoping the stupidity would end and that at least a few of the scenes would have some sort of a twist. It did not. The only people who would like this movie are those who like the silly "B" movies that they used to show on TV back in the 1970s.

**This is NOT a review of the movie; I only wish to see if the title is misleading or not.

 I was a huge fan of "Dirty Pair" back in the arcade days. I have to admit, seeing the first season, I was very disappointed. They were too "cheesy", it was not as cool as it was in the light novel and anime. But, with the second season, I fell in love with "Dirty Pair" all over again. The characters and the coolness factor are still there, and the animation has gotten much better. I would say that this second season is a little better than the first one. It has a little more action and a little more romance in it. I would say that if you liked the first season, you will like the second. If you didn't like the first season, you won't like this one. I don't know if they will continue the story, but if they do, I will definitely be buying it.

 I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but was disappointed by it. I thought it was pretty bad. I've never seen a science fiction movie that had so many plot holes. For example, I didn't understand how the "evil aliens" were the same exact aliens from the first movie. How could they have survived the blast of an atomic bomb? The plot of the movie was just too thin to support a whole movie. It seemed like there was no character development or plot progression. It seemed like just a bunch of hot chicks and spy gadgets. I understand that this is a low budget movie, but there are some movies that don't need to be big budget to tell a good story. This movie definitely didn't fit into that category. This movie could have been a lot better if they had used a few more budget.

 I've seen this movie twice and both times I watched it I just couldn't stay awake. It is so incredibly boring. The acting is appalling. Especially James Franco. I may have watched this movie alone but I'm not sure because I was laughing so hard at how bad it was. I actually thought that "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" was a better movie than this. I think I saw it in the theater a couple of years ago and I think it was a couple of years ago because I can't remember anything about it. I think the only reason I saw it the second time was because I wanted to see how bad it was. Maybe it's because I'm a kid at heart even though I'm a grown-up now. Anyway, I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

I can't believe this is the same James Franco. He was so hot in "Pineapple Express". I liked "The Room" but I thought he was completely annoying in that movie. I can't believe I'm saying this but he's one of the reasons I don't like horror movies. I'm sure that if I see him in a horror movie I
 I was very excited to see this film, mainly due to the fact that I love a good horror movie, and this one looked to be a good one. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. I thought the premise was interesting, and the idea of a deserted island was very original. The execution, and so forth, were very poor. The acting was mediocre, but the dialogue was just awful. The characters were very one-dimensional, and the story was just plain bad. The plot was not very believable and the execution of it was just bad. I hope to see better films in the future, but this one was just extremely poor.

 Haha, I loved this movie. I have been a huge fan of the original movie and this movie is just as good. I have never really been a fan of the original movie, and I thought that this movie was perfect. I loved the acting, the story, the acting, and the acting. If you are a fan of the original movie and want to see this movie, I highly recommend it. If you have never seen the original movie and want to see this, I also highly recommend it. It is a great movie for both. If you want to see the original movie, but don't want to see this, I also highly recommend it. It is a great movie for someone who has seen the original movie, and wants to see the sequel. <br /><br />I give it an 8 out of 10, and 2 out of 10.

 I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of having to watch the same movie over and over again. However, I was intrigued by the bit of hype that this movie received on various movie blogs, so I decided to give it a chance. I wasn't disappointed. The movie is about a recently widowed mother and her three daughters who have to deal with the loss of their mother when she suddenly dies of a heart attack. The story is based on the book by the same name and it's clear that the movie is a loose interpretation of the book.<br /><br />The cast is very good and all the performances are very believable. I especially enjoyed the character of the mother. She was a very strong female character and it was interesting to see her interact with her daughters. Unfortunately I didn't care for the other characters. I think the filmmakers could have done a better job of explaining who these characters were and why they were important to the story. I also thought the overall story was a bit predictable. It seemed as if the movie was more about the mother and her interactions with her daughter and her friends, than about the mother's death. But overall it was an enjoyable movie with a good cast.<br /><br
 I found this movie to be very boring and just plain annoying. The characters were not developed properly and the story was not logical. I recommend it to no one and I don't know how anyone could like this movie. It's just one of those movies that you can't sit through no matter how hard you try.

1/10<br /><br />

The only reason why I have rated this movie a 1 is because I can't give it a zero.

I wanted to watch this movie to see what the fuss is about. I watched the first 3 minutes and I was so bored I couldn't make it through. I tried to watch the remaining 88 minutes but I couldn't do it. It was funny at the beginning, the end was exciting
 In the first five minutes of this film, I was ready to scream at the TV. I mean, what the hell is going on? What does this movie have to do with the rest of the film? I could not care less about the main character and his problems. I have no idea what is going on in his mind. I have no idea why he is making the choices he is making. I have no idea what the underlying message is of the story. I was ready to walk away from the screen, turn it off and never watch it again. What a waste of time.<br /><br />I am so glad I stuck with it. It eventually began to make sense. And then it got better. And then it became a very good film. It is a little slow to start, but it eventually gets better. I did not care for the ending, but it was good. A little bit of a surprise, but good. I was a little confused as to what was going on here, but it was all good. I liked the cast and the story was good. I am glad I stuck with it. It was worth it, but I was not really all that vested in the first 5 minutes.


 The first two are the worst of the series. The third is the best and the ending is probably the best of the series, but the first two are just plain bad. The first one doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The second one is all about the dumbest video-game characters ever. The third one is far better than the second. The fourth one is just plain stupid, with all the old school movie clichés. The fifth one has a good story and the ending is awesome. The sixth one is a lot better than the fifth, but still dumb. The seventh one is actually a little better than the sixth, but still dumb. The eighth one is just plain stupid. The ninth one is the best. The tenth one is just plain stupid. The eleventh one is just plain stupid. The twelfth one is just plain stupid. The thirteenth one is just plain stupid. The fourteenth one is just plain stupid. The fifteenth one is just plain stupid. The sixteenth one is just plain stupid. The seventeenth one is just plain stupid. The eighteenth one is just plain stupid. The nineteenth one is just plain stupid. The twentieth one is just plain stupid. The twenty-first one is just plain
 This movie was a real let down for me. I've been a fan of the TV series for years but even though it's been sitting in my DVD collection for awhile, I never got around to watching it. I'm not sure what it was about it that made me decide to finally watch it yesterday, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The movie doesn't follow the series at all, so don't even bother if you are a big fan of the series. The actors who played the "Cult of the Cobra" were completely unrecognizable. I do hope they find a job soon, they did a much better job on re-runs of the series.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was shown on AMC and they didn't show any commercials.

I guess if you are a fan of the series you may want to rent it, but if you are like me and waited too long to watch it, I would advise you to rent something else.

 I am not one for giving bad reviews but I have to say that this movie has to be the worst movie ever. I watched it with my friends and we couldn't stop laughing at the bad acting, the awful direction, the horrible dialogue and the twisted story line. I was expecting a horror movie but instead I got torture porn. I would give it a 0 if I could.

The acting was illiterate, the plot was so ridiculous that I just had to laugh and pretend I was watching a movie when really I was watching someone's nightmare. The writing was so horrible that it was almost a satire of a horror movie. If I had to give it one word that describes this movie that word would be "awful".

I would only recommend this movie to people who are in the mood for a bad movie. So if you are in the mood for a scary movie, not this one.

If you liked Saw then you maybe have to watch this movie because it is like Saw meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I can only imagine that this was the worst movie ever made and I can only hope that the next one will be better.

 This, like many other Dogma films, only has merit if you completely ignore the fact that it's a Dogma film. The only thing that's Dogma about it is the fact that it's a Dogma film. If you watch it for the story and the acting, you'll probably be disappointed. The story is about a priest who is dying and has to perform an exorcism. The only thing that's interesting about this is that it has to do with Satan. I have to question the logic of anyone who actually believes that The Devil ever existed. Most religions have a story as to how The Devil came to be. This is yet another one of those stories. I suppose if you believe that The Devil is real, you believe that he can cast a spell and make someone act like they're possessed. This is just another example of how silly this movie is. The only thing that's entertaining is the acting. The performances are all very mediocre and unbelievable. The guy who plays the priest is particularly bad. They completely ruin the ending with a stupid speech that they give him. It's supposed to show how he's actually possessed by Satan but it comes off as completely fake. So, I've rambled on enough.
 I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, and have watched all of the Matrix sequels. I was so excited to see this one, but they really need to find a new movie idea. This movie was boring, confusing, and has no plot. I kept on wondering what this movie was about. It had no story line. I kept thinking, "Where is the movie heading?" I was also confused by why there were so many characters, and so many names. The movie seemed to be going in so many directions. I really wanted to like this movie, but I was disappointed. If you want to see a good action movie, then you should see the Matrix Reloaded. This movie was a waste of time.

I saw this film with my son and loved it. I couldn't believe Kiefer Sutherland is in this movie. I never knew he was a fan of the book. I would love to see more of his acting in other movies. I love the trailer for the next movie that is coming out. I think it is going to be a very good movie. Keanu has the most great acting abilities. I can't wait to see it!

 I watched this movie with a friend of mine because we thought it would be funny. We were both wrong. This movie is boring, violent, and silly. There is no story line to it, it's just one after another of "bad guy doing bad things to good people" and it's all over the place. I think it's funny if you're laughing out loud the whole time, but it's not a good movie if you want to watch it and be entertained. The one thing that I liked about it, is that it has some good ideas, but they are not followed up on. Also, the actor who plays the main character was a good actor, because he played the part well, but I think he was one of the few that had any talent in this movie.

It has no good points, it's just a bad movie.

And for those of you who are wondering why this movie is so bad, it's because it was made with no budget.

 This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I saw it on HBO and it was so bad it was funny. It was so bad I couldn't stop laughing because it was so terrible. This was a real "what the hell" movie. It was so bad I don't know how anyone could have made it. I'd like to see the people who did it. I was laughing so hard that I had to make sure the TV was actually on when I was watching it.

 This is the film that was the cause of so many lawsuits. It was based on a book called the "Shirley" written by a former inmate of the women's prison where Shirley finally ended up. The book was banned in the UK but this film was extremely popular, causing the US to pass a law against the distribution of such sensationalistic, graphic and offensive material. The film was banned for years and the story was even made into a musical in the early 70's. This is a good story though and I've seen some pretty bad prison movies. The actors are good, the sets are good and the story is interesting. The film is very much like "The Shawshank Redemption" in that it's a good story and features beautiful actress. I haven't seen the book and I'm not sure if the book is any good, but the movie is a good one.

 This was a real disappointment. I was expecting something along the lines of "The Intruder" and got something that was nowhere near that. I liked the premise but the film just didn't live up to it's potential. The acting was poor, the plot was weak and the ending was pathetic. The film is quite long and I found myself wanting it to end, I just couldn't settle into it. I was disappointed enough to buy the special edition, just to see if there was more that I missed. I would have liked to see more of the female characters, they were just not developed enough. I am not a big fan of horror but I really should have been for this. I can't understand why it got such a good review from viewers on IMDb.

3/10

Daniel Radcliffe as a young man, he is a good actor.

The plot was weak, I couldn't see the significance of the masks or the significance of their use.

The acting was poor, especially from the female lead and the lead male character.

The film is quite long, I found myself wanting it to end

The film was too gloomy for me, I just wanted to see something
 I got this VHS tape about ten years ago and after it was over, I went to the TV and found a VHS that was about another movie called "Deadly Prey" and the cover said "Featuring Dolph Lundgren". I thought this must be the same movie. I played the tape and it was indeed the same movie. So, I called my friend and told him that I had seen "Deadly Prey" and I told him to get the same tape that I just watched. But he says "No, I already got it, I want to see "Deadly Prey" ". I told him that was the same movie. So, my brother went to get the same tape and he saw "Deadly Prey" and the movie was called "Bloodsport" and the tagline said "Featuring Dolph Lundgren". So, it was a different movie. I called my friend and told him I saw a different movie and he laughed at me. So, this is my story and I hope it helps you out.

 ***<br /><br />This is a terrible movie. I usually like movies about small towns in the American south, but this movie was so bad it almost made me change my mind about the genre. I have a friend who is from about an hour away from where this movie was filmed. He said the town where the movie is set is a real place, but that the movie does NOT resemble the real place. In fact, the main character in this movie is the source of almost all the trouble in the town. This is a movie that I would expect to make up for any deficiencies in the plot by the way it was filmed and it's special effects, but they were also awful. The story is told in a very flat way and the dialogue is very bad. The actors were also terrible and the special effects were awful. I will never watch it again.

4/10

This movie is about as good as it gets for a made-for-TV movie. It's a bit cliché, but that's good for a little movie like this.

--Robert Keef

I thought it was very well done. I don't usually watch made for TV movies. I caught the first 10 minutes
 I was waiting to see this film because I was intrigued by the idea of watching a "serious" horror film that finally, after 30 years of the genre, dared to actually have a plot and be intelligent. I'm sorry to say that it was a real disappointment. The characters are completely uninteresting and the story is simply too shallow for me to care about what is happening to them. The acting is all right, but the film is so poorly made that I was able to predict the ending about four minutes before the end. At the end, the film's makers apparently decided to try to make it a serious horror film by giving some shots to the audience of actual horror films, such as "The Shining" and "The Exorcist", but it doesn't work. This film is far too trivial and shallow to be a horror film. Furthermore, the average horror fan would be insulted by the ideas behind this film. For the first time ever, I found myself saying the words, "Why the hell did they make this film?"

 I really don't understand why this movie was ever made. I mean, it's a sort of lousy "Saved By The Bell" sequel. It's a lame storyline that is not even remotely interesting and the characterizations are not even amusing. I mean, what did the movie have to offer us? A bunch of wimpy kids who were trying to get a band together? I think that's what the movie was trying to say, but it couldn't. It's a lame attempt at a teen comedy, but it's even worse than the original "Saved By The Bell." I think the main problem is that the members of the band are all really lame. I mean, the band is basically just a bunch of wimpy kids who have to form a rock band so that they can have their own concert. I think it's a pretty lame premise for a movie and it's not even a very interesting one. I mean, how many times have you heard of a storyline like that? The basic premise of the movie is that all the kids in the film want to form a band so that they can have their own concert. The movie is basically just a lame attempt at a teen comedy and it's not even very
 OK, I will admit that I was a little bit curious to see this since I had heard that it was incredible. But I was simply not impressed with this film at all. It was just a really boring, mediocre film that really had no point to tell, and a weak ending that shouldn't have been there. The acting was good, but that's about it. The story is so incredibly generic and boring, I didn't feel anything for the characters and I just couldn't bring myself to care about the fate of the characters. Also, the dialogue was just terribly predictable and boring. The characters were also weak and boring and had no purpose and that made me even less interested in them. The film, like I said, just didn't hold my interest at all. It's a shame that this film was so critically acclaimed. I feel like it was very overrated and it didn't deserve the high praise it received. This film was just a waste of time and I really hope that I don't have to see any more of this director's work.

 A poor attempt to have a little fun at the expense of the current world situation.<br /><br />The acting is not good, the script is not good, the acting is not good, the plot is not good and the direction is not good. The only good thing about it is that it's not a documentary.<br /><br />The title says it all, "War is Hell" and that is exactly what it is, a travesty of a film.<br /><br />If you want a film that has some intelligence, some humanity and some humour, do not watch this, do not rent it, do not buy it, do not watch it.

 I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. I loved the book and I love the TV series. Unfortunately, this film didn't live up to my expectations at all. It had none of the wit and charm of the TV series and it was quite boring. I can't believe they didn't have a scriptwriter or somebody else working on the film to correct the many errors in continuity that the script suffered from. As a die-hard fan of the TV series, I just can't believe that the producers of this film didn't have someone who knew the book and the film series at all well standing by to correct any mistakes. The whole thing was just so badly done. Not only was the film not at all faithful to the book, but it didn't even have the charm of the TV series. I'm so disappointed in this film. If you loved the TV series, don't waste your time seeing this film.

 I saw this movie and was very disappointed. The dialogue was terrible. I thought the plot was weak and the story line didn't make sense. I don't know if I was the only one who felt this way, but I did not like this movie.

<br /><br />The story line is weak and the plot doesn't make sense. The dialogue is terrible and I swear to you I thought I was watching a movie made in the 90's. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.

<br /><br />There are no twists in the story line. The plot is weak, the dialogue is terrible and the movie goes on for far too long. I only saw the movie for about 1/4 of it, and I was very disappointed. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.

<br /><br />I am not sure if I was the only one who felt this way, but I did not like this movie.

 I could not believe how stupid this film was. I watched it with my son and we were both really disappointed. It is a really bad film and I do not know how they got it made. I was really looking forward to it because I heard a lot of good things about it and thought it was going to be good. I guess I was wrong. I do not know what kind of people would like this. If you are going to see this movie, go prepared for the worst.

I am going to have to say that I enjoyed the soundtrack, in fact I might purchase it for my car's cd player. I did like the score, but it is nice to hear something nice.

My son was laughing at the bad acting, the really bad acting, and then at the end of the film my poor son was crying at the bad acting.

The movie was not scary, it was just stupid. I think that this film was made for the people who like a lot of violence or sex. I think that this film was made for people who are trying to get away from the real world and into a world that is not real.

I do not recommend this film for anyone. I can only
 This movie could have been good. It was filmed in Hungary, which gives it a certain charm, and it's a good cast of actors. But the script is bad. It's not funny. It's not scary. The characters are uninteresting and the actors are not acting.<br /><br />If you're looking for a horror movie which is scary, look somewhere else. If you're looking for a comedy, see "Maniac Cop." If you're looking for a very, very bad movie, see "Candyman." If you're looking for a good movie that you'll watch over and over, see "The Usual Suspects."

Horror B-Movie at its Worst

My wife and I saw "Candyman" at the movies (in theaters, not on video) and were both disappointed at how bad it was. The acting was very poor, especially by the female lead (I don't even know her name) and the special effects were very poor. The movie
 I'm not sure if I have seen a worse film in recent years. This is absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen. The plot is nothing new. It is about a guy who is sent to jail when he is framed for a crime. He eventually escapes from jail and has to go on the run from the police. There is nothing new about this plot because it has been done over and over again. The acting is very poor and the film has no style whatsoever. The director must have been so bored of this movie because it is so bad that it is almost funny. It is just so boring I found myself falling asleep a few times! I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy. This movie is definitely not worth renting or even buying. It is so bad I can't even give it a 1 out of 10! I can't even comment on the acting because the actors simply aren't any good. The whole movie is just bad, tedious and boring. If you are looking for a good movie I would recommend "The Fugitive" or "Out Of Sight" over this horrible film.

 I saw this movie on cable one night and wanted to see it again. I borrowed it from the library. I read the reviews here and it seems that I'm not alone in my disappointment. The movie is so poorly made that it's hard to believe that it was made by the same person who did "Mystery Men", "The Producers" and "The Kids Are All Right". But I can't agree that the writing is so bad. I've read a lot worse. I think the problem is that the movie is trying to be too many things at once. The movie has a fairly good idea at the beginning but it doesn't know what to do with it. It then shifts its focus to tell a comedy about a family's problems and how they resolve them. It doesn't know what it wants to be. It then shifts again and ends up as a romance. The movie has the talent needed to be a good comedy, a good romance and a good drama. But the movie is often sub-par in all of them. It's hard to find a way to make it work. It's true that this is a small movie and there are only so many ways to tell a story, but every time the movie shifts
 This movie is so bad, it makes me want to vomit. The plot is so stupid. The acting is so bad, you can't follow the dialogue. The storyline is so bad, you can't even follow the plot. The special effects are so bad, they make you want to throw up. The only way to see this movie is to watch it with a friend or family member. Only then, can you sit through the whole thing and not throw up. I don't think I've ever seen a movie worse than this. This movie is so bad, I wouldn't watch it even if I had a time machine . If you think you can handle watching this movie, you can either watch it with a friend or family member, or you can purchase the DVD and watch it alone. Either way, you won't be disappointed. I cannot believe that anyone could have thought this movie was good. If you are still reading this, then I guess it means you think you can handle watching this movie, so go ahead and watch it. You will be glad you did.

5/10

Also, I think the acting was terrible. The plot is stupid, the special effects are bad, the dialogue is hard to follow
 The movie is very strange. Like they are trying to make a sci fi movie...but it has no logic why or what is happening....no explanation....and not even a story line. The movie is very short and not very interesting. I went to see it at a theater with a lot of people and all of them said the same thing. It was like the director forgot to make a movie...just to make a movie. The movie has no real ending, no explanation, no logic, very boring and very strange. I would suggest going to the video store in the nearest town and renting something else.

I have only seen the movie once, but I still remember it. There is a scene where the guy hears something and he is walking home and he is talking to his girlfriend.....and she keeps asking him....what did you hear?...what did you see?...and he is like looking around and he is like....nothing....nothing....it was just outside of the window....nothing...I was just thinking about something....and it was....nothing....

I have no idea what this movie is about.

I have seen a lot of movies, but I have never seen anything like this before. I
 I had a feeling this would be a bad movie when it came to Netflix instant watch. I was right. It seems to be an attempt to cash in on the success of Twilight by making a movie together with a love interest from the book. The writing is horrible, the acting is horrible, and the story is horrible. I actually like the book (and I'm not a fan of Twilight at all), but this movie is so awful that I'm giving it a one star rating. I hope it does well enough to warrant a sequel, but I'm not holding my breath. See the trailer for yourself and see why I gave it a one star rating. The only thing I liked about it was the production value. It was shot on a budget and I think it shows. But that's really the only thing it has going for it.

 This movie was truly awful and boring. I was so depressed watching this movie that I had to turn it off after the first 15 minutes. The acting was terrible and the characters were very uninteresting. I do not understand how this movie was not banned from theaters across Canada. If you see this movie critic it, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of foreign films. I am only now becoming a fan of French films and this is the first one that I have truly disliked. Not because it was badly written or anything like that, but because it is such a bad movie.

 I saw the first showing of this film on the Sci-Fi Channel, and when I found out that it was a remake of "Outland" (which I've never seen - at least not while it was running on TV), I was pretty excited. I was expecting to find a decent "space opera" movie.<br /><br />I soon found out that I had been fooled. The film opens showing a big asteroid field, full of asteroids. After a bit of time in the asteroid field, we see the main character (Hugh Jackman) getting a call from his wife, telling him that she'll be on the other side of the planet, and that she'll be alone. Hugh decides to join her, and we see a montage of the two of them falling into love. Then, as soon as he and his wife are alone, as Hugh gets ready to leave, his wife is killed by a big asteroid. Hugh, who had been looking for her in the asteroid field, accidentally backtracks, and becomes trapped in the asteroid field. The next thing we see is a huge alien spaceship, piloted by a giant creature, entering the asteroid field. Hugh, who had been stuck in the asteroid field for
 In The Company of Men, an older man (Philip Seymour Hoffman) befriends a younger man (Vincent Gallo) who is in the process of leaving his wife (Rachel Weisz). The older man is very candid in his advice to the younger man, which is along the lines of "don't emasculate her by leaving her". The younger man then proceeds to emasculate his wife. Meanwhile, the older man gets involved with a younger woman (Marisa Tomei) who is also in the process of leaving her husband.<br /><br />There is a certain something missing in this movie. It's not the fact that it's a movie about emasculation, which is the subject of much of the dialogue. The missing something is the plot. The movie is about a man who is about to leave his wife, and his friends warn him not to. But then, he does it anyway. This sounds like a plot in and of itself, doesn't it? Or, to put it another way, we have a plot of a man who is about to leave his wife, and his friends warn him not to. But then, he does it anyway. Now, we have a story
 Well, I really don't feel like saying much after seeing this movie. It was boring, uninteresting and had no good storyline. I know that it was released in the US as a "B" movie because of the fact that some people might find it entertaining, but it was a total disappointment. I thought that it was going to be a good one, but it was a boring, flimflammery movie.<br /><br />The acting was terrible and I'm sure that some of the actors hadn't even tried to act, they just played the characters they had written into the script. The way the movie was shot was really bad and I don't know why they didn't use any good cameras. One scene was a car being filmed by a small camera, maybe a camcorder. It was shot down the street and it was very grainy and dark. The movie was also poorly edited and it didn't help that the director was always going out of focus. I don't think that the director cared about what he was doing and he wasn't very good at telling the story. The story was about a man who was in prison for killing his boss and he was released and was with a woman who he
 I've been a big fan of the original "Star Trek" series from the sixties, and was really excited to hear that a new movie was coming out. I really can't figure out why this movie is so popular. It didn't have the same effect on me as the original series had, and I'm a pretty big fan. I know that the first movie had a lot of technical problems, and I don't want to go into them here. But the so-called "surprises" that were supposedly going to happen in this movie didn't happen. The movie was kind of slow, and it seemed to drag on forever. I guess the only positive thing I can say was that the special effects were good, and there weren't too many scenes of people running around in their underwear. I can't help but wonder if this movie is due to the fact that the original series is no longer on the air. I'm hoping that next year's movie will be as good as this one was, or better.

F.A.Q.'s

Q. Is this movie based on a real life incident?


 I have heard of "The Producers", but never watched it. I am not sure what the hype is about. I am not sure what I expected, but I was not impressed. It was pretty bad. In one of the scenes, the characters are talking about how they are going to out-smart the consumer. I am not sure if they did, but they really did not think this through. They make up a song, but they do not know what they are singing about. The characters are not even believable. The story was not very exciting. I did not care what happened to the characters. I am not sure what I would recommend it for, but I do not think I would recommend it for anybody.

10/10 for the acting, 1/10 for the story, and 1/10 for the overall experience.

SPOILER WARNING!!

<br /><br />The show was about a group of producers who make bad movies, but they make a movie that is so bad that it makes a lot of money. I am not sure if it makes a lot of money in the real world, but they really do not think it through.

The first scene of the movie is
 I'm sorry to say that after watching this film, I came to the conclusion that it was a total waste of my time. Maybe I'll see it again... but I'm not sure. It didn't get to me at all. The plot is completely predictable, the characters are so one-dimensional it's unbelievable (in other words, they're not even human), the acting was pitiful and the writing was so bad that it was painful to watch. I found the whole thing to be very, very trite. I would not recommend this film to anyone, but especially to the young and impressionable. It's a film that should be shunned. Don't even think about it. Please.

If you want to see a sweet, warm, tender and a touching film, look no further than THE WEDDING SINGER. It's a far superior film.

My rating for THE DARKNESS: 1/10.

My rating for THE WEDDING SINGER: 10/10.

 I remember watching this movie as a kid and being overjoyed. It was the first movie I ever saw with a girl that wasn't blonde and extremely dumb. This movie had potential, because it starred the nerdiest guy on the planet, but it had a horrible plot. The entire movie was a bunch of jokes that had no substance, and the movie was so forgettable that I can't even remember the ending. I still have the VHS and the poster, but I never even bothered to find it on DVD. The movie was just so bad that I could never bring myself to watch it again, and it's been years. If you've never seen this movie, don't bother. It's not worth it.

The only good thing about this movie was the special effects. The rest of the movie was awful. I'm not sure why, but for some reason I find it hard to watch this movie. It just seems so boring to me. The part where Luke and Leia were on the ice planet, and a deflector shield put out the fire on the ice planet, was the only scene with any action. The rest of the movie was just Luke and Leia
 I saw this movie at a movie night with a friend and I was disappointed. I felt like I was watching a short student film. I would say that the acting was okay, but not great. I was not impressed. The story was not that interesting. The story line was that the main character was trying to get back his girlfriend who left him for another man. I didn't really care how he got back his girlfriend. Also, the movie did not have much of a plot. I felt that the movie was trying to be artsy and something new. My favorite character was when the main character was doing something dramatic, and his girlfriend was trying to help him. Overall, it was not that interesting. I would not recommend this movie to any of my friends.

While the premise of this film is nothing all that original, the way it's been presented makes the movie a definite must see. Pacino's character is a father who's lost his daughter to a car accident. He has a son who takes after his father in all the ways he's not proud of. The son is a troubled,
 This is the worst science fiction movie I have ever seen. The characters are so shallow and one-dimensional, the plot is paper thin, and the whole thing looks like a grade-Z made-for-TV movie. I can't believe this movie has been nominated for an Oscar. I'm sure if the shoe fits, wear it, but this does not.

The acting is flat and uninteresting, the special effects are laughable, the dialog is horrible, the directing is disjointed and confusing, the plot is confusing, the characters are all one-dimensional, the story is not well-conceived, the action is lame and non-existent, and the cinematography is poor. The only thing that is good about this movie is the special effects. But even those are so bad they are laughable. The whole thing is a piece of sh*t.

I would rather sit through an episode of the Olsen twins than watch this crap.

Funny, but not funny enough to be worth a trip to the theater.

This is a very funny movie, but it's not funny enough to be worth the trip to the theater to see. The movie is very short, and the running time is probably not more than 90 minutes. The main problem is that the movie is not funny enough to make that much time worthwhile. I'd probably recommend spending the money to see it on a video, but you'll be missing out on some very funny gags.

Inspector Rex is one of the best anime movies I've seen.


 This is a film of many flaws, including bad acting, bad dialog, poor directing and a poor script. I think the filmmakers were intent on turning this into a horror film, but failed miserably in that endeavor. There are some good scares, but overall, it is really just a bad film.

The acting is bad. The dialog is bad. The directing is bad. The script is bad. The only thing good about this film is the music. The score is very good, and the songs are OK. I wish the film had been better than it was.

I give this film 4/10.

Oh, and by the way, if you are going to rent this film, be warned, it is very graphic, including rape scenes.

See it at your own risk.

 I'm just a bit disappointed in the fact that Hollywood should make a movie like this. A movie that is so predictable with the way it goes, so unrewarding and so "un-Hollywood." The acting is brilliant, the story is just plain silly and the action is just boring. I don't know if it was the camera work, the editing or the score, but the movie was just too slow and boring. I think that this movie is going to be forgotten very quickly. I'm sorry, but this movie just fell flat on its face.

I've seen a lot of the big names and I have to say that the acting in this movie was the best I've seen in a while. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into the acting. I would gladly watch this again if it were on TV, but I think it was filmed on camcorder. I really don't understand how they were able to get away with
 The story was very good and the acting was excellent, but the movie was just too long. It could have been done in half the time. I have seen many films with this same story and this is the first time I have ever been bored by one. I watched it because it was directed by Luis Bunuel and because of the cast, which included Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda and Mary Steenburgen. I was not expecting much from it and was surprised at how boring it was. I would recommend it for those who want to see an interesting and unusual story.

B-movie made into a great movie.

I have seen this movie many times. No matter how many times I see it, I find it just as interesting and intriguing as the first time I saw it. With the same actors, it has a great story, but the way it is written and filmed makes it a classic. I love movies like this. It is easy to see what makes a more entertaining movie, like "Fried
 From the moment this film opens with a naked man covered in cement being dropped through a hole in the ceiling, you know you're in for a very interesting, if not disturbing, film. The filmmakers take a very unique, creative, and original approach to the concept of a film, in that they leave no room for the audience to be bored. The odd structure of the film -- alternating between the present and a flashback to a past life -- allows for the audience to compare and contrast the two timelines. The only way to do this is to watch the film with an open mind, and pay attention to the similarities and differences between the two. The film is not only interesting, but also very well acted. The dialogue is clever and the actors pull it off. The only problem with the film is that it is not as well put together as it should be. Without spoiling anything, the ending is a bit of a let down. The premise of the film is very original, and the acting is good. The story is compelling and the characters are well rounded. The cinematography is excellent and the music and sound effects are perfect. The only thing missing from the film is an effective climax. By the time the film gets to the end,
 This movie is so bad it's funny, and I'm not just saying that because its about squirrels. I mean it's bad like "Alien" bad, but only funny instead of scary. The plot is so stupid, the characters so unbelievable, the acting is so bad that it's funny, the special effects are so bad they are funny, and the squirrels are so funny that they are scary. It has a lot of elements of a horror movie but it doesn't deliver. It was a waste of my time, but I'm glad I watched it. I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie. If you are the kind of person that likes watching bad movies, this is the movie for you.

Buy this? No, don't waste your time.

5/10

I wish this movie was funny, I wish that the squirrels weren't so scary and I wish that it was a little less predictable. If your a horror fan and want to watch a bad movie, this is for you. If your a horror fan and want to see a good movie, then don't bother.

Buy this? No, don't waste your time.

4/10

 This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is so bad that it makes the documentary "Citizen Kane" look like Citizen Kane. It's obvious that a lot of money was spent on this film, but it was all wasted. I really wonder how such a film could have been made. The plot is so bad that it is hard to follow. I was unable to identify with the characters, as they all seemed so shallow and unlikeable. I was so disappointed that I couldn't even finish watching the film.<br /><br />I also felt that this film was very insulting to women. Many parts of the film revolved around the character of the "office manager", played by the actress who played the "office manager". She was the only character that was remotely likeable in the film. I can't understand how the director believed that this would be a good idea. This was the worst film I have ever seen.

 I was pretty excited about this movie since I love the book. However, the movie was quite a let down. The acting was not very good at all, and it was hard to tell if they were speaking English or not. I did not feel like I was watching a movie. It was just a lot of talking and not a whole lot of action. This movie is not worth seeing if you have not read the book.

Not as good as the book, but still a nice story

Author: cmarie3 from United States

11 December 2006



I loved the book series and was excited to see the movie. I will say that the movie did not live up to my expectations. I had read the book over and over again, and I found it difficult to get through. The actors were not as strong as the actors in the book. The ending was different than in the book and the movie was not as good as the book. I think that the movie would have been better if the book had been made into a film. The movie was a nice tribute to the author,
 I don't know if this is the only movie of this nature that has been made. It seemed to me that it was a rip off of the movie "A Gathering Storm", the movie which features former President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower. It seemed to me that this movie had the same plot with the exception of the fact that the "hero" was a Marine instead of an Army man. The movie is basically a documentary with a little bit of dramatization thrown in. I am not sure if this was supposed to be a documentary, but it seemed to me that the movie was made that way. There is no plot to this movie, the "hero" goes from one place to the next and this woman has a lot to say, but the movie isn't about her, the movie is about the Marine. I just did not understand why all of this was done in a movie, I thought it was all kind of weird. I just felt that the movie was not necessary, I think I can do a better job. The movie had no redeeming value for me and I only watched it for the "love" of the movie. I think this movie would have been better if it had been a documentary.

I
 I have to say that this movie was way overrated. I have nothing against the director, but the movie itself wasn't that good. The acting was too "acting" for me, the story was too complicated, the action sequences were all over the place and some of them were just stupid. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was gonna be good, but it was just not. The movie had a cool concept, but it failed at all the details. The story was way too complex and the action sequences were too fast.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but it obviously didn't deserve the praise it got. It is a good movie, but it is not in the same league as "The Matrix". It is also not a complete rip-off of the movie, but it was really close to it. I think that the movie was better than "Matrix 2" (which wasn't that good either), but not as good as "The Matrix", which is still my favorite.

5.0 out of 10 stars The Matrix meets "Spirited Away" Format: DVD I have to say that I watched this movie because of the rave reviews. I am not a big fan
 I snagged this from a local garage sale for a buck, not expecting much because I had seen a lot of garbage during my time in the military. I decided to give it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Though the film is a bit dated now, it's definitely worth watching. It's an excellent example of a collaboration between a great director and a great screenwriter. The acting was superb, and the script was a little more literate than you would expect from a 1950's film. Sanford Meisner is the main character, and is amazing. His stage work is well known, and his screen work is equally as good. His character has a lot of depth, and he's not afraid to show it.<br /><br />A lot of people say the movie is about corruption in the military, and that's true to an extent. However, it's also about the carefree lifestyle of the GI's in comparison to the daily grind of a career military man. It's about the two sides of war, both the good and the bad. It's about the military lifestyle, and the sacrifices it requires. The movie is a great example of what it was like for the men and women of
 I had my doubts about this movie, when it came out, but I was really surprised. The acting was actually pretty good, it was filmed in black and white and the cinematography is really good. The film is very slow, it's not even a thriller, but it's also very well shot. There is a lot of nudity in the film and that was a little disturbing to me, but that is not the main problem. The main problem is the plot. It's just not very believable. Maybe it's the plot that is not believable, but the way it is filmed, I thought it would be more of a thriller. Still a good film though.

I'd give it a 7 out of 10.

 This movie is a collection of bad acting, bad story and bad directing. It has a lot of problems with its story and dialogue. If it had more good dialogues it would be a lot better written. The bad acting is the biggest problem here. It is very hard to understand the characters and the things they say. Also the characters seem to be very stupid and the story is not very good. It seems like the story is written for the movie and not for the movie. It is these kinds of movies that are good for a laugh but not much else. The direction is very bad too. The camera's movement is very weird and it does not fit in the story. It does not seem like the director was really able to control what was going on. The conflicts are very hard to understand and the end is very unclear and confusing. The story seems to start somewhere in the middle and then it jumps to the end and you can't really understand why it is happening. It is very hard to understand the characters and the story. Also the acting is very bad. The actors are very bad here. They do a lot of strange and awkward things and they do not fit in the story at all. They just seem to be very dumb
 This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I say worst because I don't mean it's bad because it's bad, I mean it's bad because it's so bad it's funny. I'm a huge fan of horror and indie films and even some mainstream films, but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of bad films, but this is one of the worst.<br /><br />Now I am going to be completely honest, I am a big fan of the original film "The Hills Have Eyes". I believe that it is a classic in the horror genre and I think it is a must see film. I also own a copy of the DVD and I usually watch it when I am bored. I love horror films and I think that this is one of the best horror films of all time. However I saw this film and I thought it was just as bad as the original. It just didn't have the right feel to it. I had a friend who told me that the movie was supposed to be more of a comedy, but I still felt it was just as bad as the original as a horror film.<br /><br />I mean seriously, the
 It's hard to believe that, in the year 2000, a film like this can be made. The plot is at best silly, and does not make any sense. The script is so bad, it's hard to believe that a second draft was even made. The acting is terrible. The characters have no purpose. The obligatory, "Why didn't she just tell him?" line is used in every scene. The director of photography (the guy who sets the lighting) knows nothing about lighting, and the comparisons between the shots he set up and the actual shots in the film are horrific. Most of the film takes place in one room, and the lighting is so bad it's almost impossible to see what's going on. All of this bad material was shot with a $1 million dollar budget, and it was done in two weeks. It's obvious that the filmmakers were under a great deal of pressure to bring the film in on time and on budget. Despite all of these problems, it is not particularly funny, and there is no point that the film makes. The only thing this film has going for it is the fact that it is the directorial debut of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who are known for their work
 A group of friends are at a creepy old house that is supposedly haunted. An old woman comes to visit them and is murdered by one of the friends. The remaining friends try to figure out what is going on and what is killing off their friends. There are a lot of clues and a lot of questions but no answers are ever really given. The acting was pretty bad and didn't really help the film at all. I did like the film but I'm a fan of the older horror movies and this one did not really fit in the category of a horror film. I would recommend renting this one but I would not buy it.

 I was truly hoping that this movie would be good. I was hoping that it would be a movie that I would like, that I would be able to sit down and watch a few times without getting sick of it. I was hoping that it would make me laugh. God help me, I was hoping that it would have a plot. It didn't. The only thing that made this movie watchable was the fact that it was only two hours long. I know that the two hours seemed like two days, but at least it was two hours... no wait... was it two days? It was two hours. But I didn't care. I just wanted it to end. And after it was over, I wanted to never see it again.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a group of people who are on their way to an evening cruise. It is the first day of their trip, but the problem is that one of them (the narrator) has a broken leg. No problem, right? All of the passengers are very capable of taking care of themselves. No one is worried. Well, except for the narrator. The narrator is worried. He's worried about his leg, but he's also worried about his entire
 This was the first time that I've seen this movie and I was very disappointed. It could have been a good movie but the ending was so ridiculously bad that it ruined the whole movie for me. The end was just crazy ridiculous. I think the director was trying to make a drama, but instead it was a comedy. I'm pretty sure the director would have had a better chance of making a movie 100% if he had made it into a comedy. To be honest, I don't think the actors did a very good job. The ending was so bad that it made me laugh out loud. I laughed because it was so ridiculous. The whole time I was watching this movie I was trying to figure out what was the point of it. I finally figured out that it was supposed to be a comedy. I don't know what the point of it was. It was just a bunch of teens walking around in a forest that was something like a summer camp. I'd give this movie a C. I'd give this movie a D<br /><br />

 I was very excited when I saw the trailer for this movie I had to see it. The premise of this movie is great and I was very excited to see what it was all about. What I saw was Hollywood at its worst. I saw a lot of people shooting guns, cars exploding and a lot of shaky camera movement. I saw some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life. I wanted to laugh at the acting but I couldn't because it was just that bad. So what really made this movie was the action and it was just as bad as the acting.<br /><br />The action was just all over the place. The initial car chase I thought was really cool and had a lot of action in it but it was just that the car chase that had the best action in it. The rest of the action was pretty bad. There was a lot of shaky camera shots and the actors didn't even seem to be trying to act. I think the main reason that they didn't seem to be trying to act was because of the bad acting. When you watch a movie, you look at it and think that the actors have to have some kind of emotion. You look at it and think that they've got
 This is a film that needs to be seen in a theatre. Once seen it will never be forgotten. This film is truly unique and it will stay with you. The acting and the direction are top notch.

 This is a very poor quality made to look like a film, and it doesn't even have a budget. It stinks of bad acting. The plot is very weak and it fails to tell us anything new or interesting. The acting is terrible, the plot is boring and the picture quality is poor. You don't even get to see the band playing the song. A very poor film, you can't even comment on the quality of the editing or the sound quality as there is no sound. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

The only good thing about this film is the band "Uncle Tupelo".

 I must say I have never been so disgusted by a film. This film is a direct result of the fact that the writers of the film and the director of the film have no clue about what a "horror" film is supposed to be. The story is impossible to follow and the characters are so annoying that you don't care what happens. I'm half way through and am sorry I bought the DVD. The actors are good, but the script has no sense of horror and is more like bad soap opera. I guess the producers felt that since they had to pay the actors they should get them something to do. I'm used to cheesey horror and this is not it. Don't buy this one unless you want to be entertained by a truly boring film.

The Horror Show (2007) Lacking in any real horror 3 December 2007 - 7 out of 15 users found this review helpful. I have to agree with the previous comment. This is one of the most boring and pointless horror films I have ever seen. The only thing interesting about this film is the fact that it is based on the true story of the "lemon heads
 The first half of the film is a bit slow and pretentious, but it gets better in the second half. The cinematography is very good, and there are some nice scenes in the second half. It would have been nice to see a few more of the scenes in the first half, but I think they were jammed in there to make it seem more "epic" than it really is.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good, but the writing wasn't that good. I wish they would have left out the whole "I'm a new parent" angle. It seemed as if the writer was trying to make it as bad as possible for the parents, or something. I also wish that the writer had focused more on the effects of the plague on the villagers. The effects of the plague were pretty much a lead-in to the climax of the story, but it seemed to drag on a bit. It would have been more interesting if we had seen a bit more of the effects on the villagers. Perhaps it would have been too much to ask for a scene where the villagers are fighting over food because there is no food and the kids are starving. It would have been nice to see what the villagers did after the
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's got a few good moments, but the rest of the movie is just a confusing mess. The script is just horrible, the acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. I've seen worse movies, but this one is just a complete waste of time.

 This is it, the dud of the season, starring Kurt Russell and Tom Selleck. However, in my opinion, the best part of this movie is the title. The movie itself is just not that good. Russell is a believable leader of a group of outlaws, but his character is not very convincing. Selleck is playing a character that he has played before, and he was not very good in it, either. Also, the story line is just not very interesting. Selleck's character, who is an ex-cop, is not very good at being a policeman. He is a little too naive for a cop and makes many mistakes in his first few days on the job. He also is not very good at using his weapons. Russell's character is a little too much of a bad guy, but he is not very convincing as a bad guy. There is not very much action in the movie, and that is what keeps it from being a good movie. Also, the movie has a few very obvious plot holes and unrealistic scenes. But there are some funny moments in the movie as well. Overall, it is not a very good movie, but it is a little better than the other Remington Steele
 I was very disappointed with this film. I was so looking forward to seeing it and I'm an avid fan of the book, but I think I would have been better off if I had just read the book, the film is a very poor adaptation. The storyline isn't believable, the characters don't feel right, the acting is terrible, the characters are not developed at all, the scenery is poor, the film itself is unwatchable, and the only thing I liked about this film was the music. I found the movie to be very slow and boring and I was glad when it was over. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because I had read the book and it was very interesting, I'm not sure what the director was thinking but the book was much better. I think if the film had been done by someone else, it may have been good, but it is not a good adaptation of the book.

 I must say that I was expecting a lot from this movie. I know they are trying to make a new Jeep movie and they have a great team of actors and producers behind the project. So I was expecting great acting and directing and a good script with some surprises. But what I got was really bad acting, bad directing and a really bad script.<br /><br />I don't see how this movie can be called a Jeep movie. I see it more as a drama on life. But at least they didn't do something real stupid like they did in the Fast and the Furious movies. Here they have a Jeep as a real life hero, but he is not perfect. He has to fight his enemies and there is a lot of action. But I would hardly call it a good Jeep movie, more of a drama on the life of a hero.<br /><br />The story is about a young guy who lives in the ghetto with his family. He has become a good street fighter and in his spare time he does some street racing. But he is still not a street racer and he can't afford to buy a car. So he doesn't even have a driver's license. And he also doesn't have a car
 A story about a girl who loses her boyfriend in a plane crash. The movie seemed to be lost in the movie. It was very dull and the acting was not good. The movie was very predictable throughout. The movie showed a lot of airplane crashes and never showed a plane crash itself. The movie seemed to be a little bit of a rip-off of ET. The movie was also very cheesy and it was very unrealistic. The movie was very unnecessary and it was also very slow, so this movie is not recommended.

Rating: ** If you are looking for a good plane crash movie, I would recommend Air Force One or The Lost World. I would rate this movie a 0 out of 10

 I was given this DVD for Christmas and found it a huge disappointment. The acting is terrible and the film looks amateurish. The audio quality is also poor. The story is weak and lacks any depth. The film is overlong and boring, not helping that there is no storyline and not much to say about it. Not a patch on the first film.

From my DVD options:

1. The best thing about this film is the "behind the scenes" footage of the actors going through their lines. I found this quite entertaining, but not many others will.

2. The "scenes" are not very interesting. The look of the film is not much to write home about. The actors are not very good and this is clearly evident.

3. The story is not very interesting and is only really interesting in the "behind the scenes" footage.

For the first film in the series, I was really impressed by it. The story was well thought out and the acting was very good. This film is 100% not worth watching.

If you have not seen the first film, then don't bother with this one.

4/10

P.S. The cover
 I know that the critic of this film is a major fan of the original, but I think that the original was a little too silly and a little too much of a spoof of the original. I am a fan of Burt Reynolds, but I think that this film was not a good effort on his part. He tried to make it as serious as possible, but it wasn't.<br /><br />I also think that the original was a better film, with more laughs and more interest. I am a huge fan of this film, but I think that it is a little overrated and a little overpraised.<br /><br />It's still a fun film, and the ending is great, but I think that it's a lot of overpraising.

1.0 out of 5 stars Bland and Boring. Format: DVD This film is rather bland and boring. Reynolds attempts to make it funny with the new characters, but the end result is very bad. There are also too many funny lines, which are delivered in a very weak manner. The film has a few good moments, but they are not worth the effort. The dialogue is also very dull.<br /><
 I liked the first episode, the second one was a bit better, the third was the worst and the fourth was the best. I didn't like the character and it was a bit boring. I don't know why they decided to create a show of this subject and I don't know why they decided to make it in the first place. I would like to know why they decided to do it, how they did and how the show was created. I don't think I will watch the fifth episode. I will wait until the sixth episode to see if it's better or not. I will give it a 2 out of 10.

 The plot is so thin, you might as well write it on the back of a piece of paper and fold it up, maybe even burn it. The plot isn't really the problem here, it's the fact that this is just painfully boring. I've seen better amateur productions than this on the internet. The only reason to watch this is to see how bad it can actually be. It's a little better than that, but not by much. It's just painfully boring. If you like this movie, then you are a very dull and boring person. Don't watch this movie, it's horrible.

I have to say that I am a big fan of Ninjas and I have seen many Ninjas movies, but this one has been the worst.

If you like watching people get their heads chopped off, you will love this movie.

I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie, it's not even entertaining.

I would give this movie a -20,000,000 on a scale of 1 to 10.

Don't watch this movie, it's horrible.

 In the spirit of BEWARE THE CHILD, I thought I'd give this film a shot. I have to say I was sorely disappointed. It was painful to watch the characters repeatedly try to make the film more interesting. They are trying to achieve something, but don't realize it. The story is uninteresting, the characters are dull and the dialogue is not even clever. I started to give up on it and was willing to move on to something I hadn't seen before when I noticed they were trying to make it more interesting. It was like they were trying to make a movie that would be a hit at the Sundance Film Festival. There is nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't make for a good movie. If you have seen every movie ever made, then this one might be a fun diversion. Otherwise, run far, far away from this film.

1.0 out of 5 stars Worst movie I have ever seen in my life

I am absolutely amazed that this movie is getting such good reviews. It is the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen in my life. I could not believe how boring this movie was. I don't know how anyone could sit through this movie.

 This is a terrible film. The acting is wretched, and so is the production quality. I thought it was an awful film, and I can't imagine anyone finding it entertaining or even mildly watchable. The only thing it has going for it is that it's not a Disney film.

 I saw this movie on cable and was so disappointed I had to write about it. What a waste of film. I wanted to like this movie, as I went to see it in the theater as it is directed by one of my favorite directors, Atom Egoyan, but it was a complete waste of time. The film seems to have been shot by a cinematographer who never used a single light meter. It just looks bad. The sets look like they were built in a garage, and the actors are just there to act. The story is horrific and is supposed to be about a psychiatrist who is attacked by a patient, but it's not very well told. It was obvious the director had no idea of how to bring the characters to life, so he just had them say a lot of things. The film is about a psychiatrist who is treated badly by his patients and then he is attacked by a patient, so he tries to get revenge, but it's not clear how he does it. The film is a waste of time, but at least it is a waste of good film stock. I was very disappointed in this film, and if you are going to see it, try to get a DVD so you don't have

It's a nice date if you ignore the fact that she keeps on asking him what his college major was and that he keeps on saying that he was an engineer in the computer department. Then they get back to their place and the first thing he asks her is whether she wants to have sex. She doesn't. Then they talk about their respective lives and then it's to bed. In the morning everything is fine and they decide to go to a roof-top bar. As they're sitting there they receive a call from Kevin's father who asks them to go to his hospital room because something is wrong. They go there, but he's fine. Then he gets a

 This film was the worst movie I have ever seen. I really enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie but all of a sudden it became a complete mess. There were so many things that should have been edited out but they were left in. Yes, the director and writer were trying to show the evilness of the computer but it just became over the top. I was very disappointed in this movie.

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The first half was very good, but the second half was horrible. The actors were excellent, but the story was choppy. Perhaps the film could have been better, but it was still a good film.

I like this movie. I have seen it many times and it never gets old
 Sorry, I was hoping that this was going to be a funny sitcom about a wacky family from the South. I thought that it would be like "The Jeffersons", "In Living Color" or "Martin". It wasn't. It was funny for about two minutes, but then it really got old and I stopped laughing. I don't understand why everyone had to be so obnoxious about the fact that it was a comedy. If you want to watch some good old fashioned family comedy, try the Cosby show. It is a far better show than this one. I think it was even funnier than "The Jeffersons". This show was full of stupid jokes and the family was annoying. I also think that the actors were good, but I don't think they were good enough to carry a show.<br /><br />I also thought that the plot was boring. It seemed like they were living paycheck to paycheck, and they were always struggling to get by. I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy for them. I thought that the story was really pointless.<br /><br />I think that if you are a fan of "The Jeffersons" and "In Living Color" that you would like this
 I have waited for the day that I would be able to review this piece of crap.

If you can't even find the DVD, I'm not sure how you will be able to understand this review.<br /><br />NOTE: I am not a reviewer, and I am not a film critic. I just know when a film is bad, and this film is bad.

 I first saw the movie in the theater in 1980. I loved it. It's a great story, and one of the few films which I saw as a kid which I still love to watch today. About ten years ago, I saw it on video, and I thought that it was as good as I remembered it. But I couldn't help but notice that the quality was not as good as I remembered it. It was as if the director had been forced to shoot the movie in a hurry. I've never understood why the DVD version was so obviously inferior to the VHS version. The colors seemed faded, and the sound was no longer as loud, clear and crisp. Because the DVD version was so inferior, I decided to write this review. It's a shame that a good movie was so obviously mistreated by its producers. It's one of those films that I would recommend to anyone who has never seen it. But if you're considering buying the DVD, please don't. It's not worth the money. It's a shame, because this is a great movie.

 ..or maybe it's just that I was expecting more from a Burt Reynolds film. I had high hopes for this movie, having recently read the book, and I was pleasantly surprised. The film is well-written, and the acting is good--Burt is not the same old Burt we've seen in so many other films. He is an appealing character, and the plot moves along briskly. However, somehow, I just don't care whether he and Betty make it as a couple. There is no real chemistry between them, and I don't believe that they would have worked out in real life. They come across as shallow, self-absorbed, and insincere. It is obvious that they have been together before the accident, and they behave as if they have known each other forever. It seemed like they were acting out a script, not acting out the life of a couple who might actually have lived together for some time. If you are a fan of Burt Reynolds, you will be disappointed with this film. I was curious to see what he would do in a light romantic comedy, and I am left wondering about his choice of material.

 I hate to say something negative about a movie when it is based on a book I liked but the book is great. The movie was very confusing, it didn't flow with the story and when the movie was over I was still confused. I have never read the book but I was still confused and didn't understand the ending. If you like the book and you are looking for a movie that tells the story than this is not the movie to watch. I would suggest the book to anyone who likes a good book.

I really like the book but the movie is not the same.

 This is probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The acting is terrible, the story is even worse, the special effects are laughable, the script is confusing and the dialog is so bad that it makes me cringe. I don't know what the director was thinking with this movie. It seems like he had no clue what he was doing. The director's name is Brendan Murphy, and if you watch the credits at the bottom of the screen before the movie starts, you will see that he is the only person credited for this film. The story is about a man who has a late night job in a small town that keeps him awake at night. He meets a very beautiful woman and she has been very isolated in her life. He starts to fall in love with her, but he can't help but notice that she has a dark secret that she is hiding. But the man has a dark secret of his own, and it is revealed in the middle of the movie that he has been a serial killer in the past. The man tries to stop the woman from telling the police about him, but he is not able to do so. Will the man tell the police that the woman is his accomplice? All of
 I just finished watching the entire series. It was a real disappointment. I have never written a review before, but I felt compelled to write one after watching the entire series.<br /><br />Policeman John Pride is sent to investigate a series of murders and suicides. He is joined in his search by the beautiful and clever Lucy, who is also in the midst of a personal crisis and has a thing for Pride. As the series unfolds, Pride and Lucy begin to realize that the murderer is someone who has targeted them individually. The series ends with Pride and Lucy together, but there is no closure as we are left to wonder who the murderer is. The ending is also a little goofy. I figured Pride would die of a heart attack, but it seems he had a heart transplant after he was shot at the end of the series. I must admit that I was entertained by most of the episodes, but the ending left me feeling like I wasted my time watching the entire series. I hope someone will make a movie of the series because it would be great to have a Pride/Lucy movie.

 This movie was really bad. it definitely didn't make any sense. The story line was very stupid. The acting was horrible.

If you want to see a good movie go see "Unfaithful", it is a great movie. Only watch this movie if you are bored. If you want to see a good movie go see "Pulp Fiction", it is a great movie.

 Some horror movies are so predictable that you can't help but laugh at it; "The Thing" is one of these movies. It's amazing how the story is actually more interesting than the actual movie. I don't know why but "The Thing" just didn't interest me. It's very short, which is a good thing. The acting is borderline terrible, the storyline is very boring, and the special effects are not even that good. I'll give it two stars for being short and sweet. I think this movie was made for the fans of the original "The Thing", and I think they'll love it. I don't. I just can't get into it.

 I saw this movie because I liked the actors, I thought it would be cool to see a movie with a bunch of actors playing themselves. I don't know why the movie has gotten such a bad review, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that they made the actors do stupid moves and the movie was so short. The movie was just a collection of jokes and a lot of stuff going on at the same time. I know that's not what a movie is supposed to be but it's not something out of a bad movie, it was just a bad movie. The acting was not that good, the jokes and gags are funny, but would only be funny to those who know the actors in the movie. I would have preferred to watch them in other movies, but I guess this is the only movie they have in this career of theirs. I thought maybe the movie would contain more jokes, but it was just a bunch of stuff going on at the same time. I think that this is really a good idea for a movie, maybe if it was longer and more jokes I might have liked it more, but it was just a bunch of stuff going on at the same time.

 I did not laugh once during this movie. I had low expectations after hearing about this movie, and I have to say, I was completely and totally disappointed. I rented it just to see how bad it really was, and after watching it, I can say it was the worst movie I have ever seen. I think the only reason I didn't give it a 0 is because I felt bad for the director. The acting was ridiculous. There was no plot, and no script. I think it was supposed to be a comedy, but it wasn't. The idea that the first 15 minutes were supposed to be funny, and then it was supposed to be a horror movie, but it wasn't. I also think the supposed "intro" to the movie is supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. It just was a bunch of random scenes thrown together, and they were funny in the beginning, but that was the only funny thing in the whole movie. The characters were all annoying, and the "comedy" of the movie was so bad that I kept laughing. I kept trying to find a good thing about this movie, but I couldn't. The actors tried their best, but they couldn't save this movie. I

 I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I thought I was going to see a story about the fall of the Berlin wall, but in reality I didn't see much of the wall at all. Actually, all I saw was the walls of the Russian prison. I felt that the movie was a little too long, and that the story of the Berlin wall was not developed enough. I was disappointed, and would recommend this movie to only people who are interested in the Berlin wall.

This movie is about the fall of the Berlin wall and the subsequent reunification of Germany. It is based on the true story of a group of East German prisoners of war who escape from a prison camp and plan to reunite with their families.

The movie starts out with a few scenes from the fall of the wall in 1989, of people celebrating in the streets of East Berlin. The wall comes down, and the East German prisoners of war are able to escape. They are hunted by the KGB and stumble across an old man named Rupert who is able to help them hide out in his farm. Rupert tells them that they should go to the West and
 There is a reason why the three "Houdini" movies are so bad. The dreadful acting, the awful script and some of the out-of-place special effects are what is wrong with "Houdini". The film is also one of those that is so bad that it is not even funny, unless you are a fan of bad movies. I am a huge fan of Houdini, but even he couldn't make this film entertaining. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you are a big fan of Houdini.

"Houdini" is a movie that tries very hard, but fails miserably. The story is about a magician who wants to be discovered and who wants to be a famous magician. Unfortunately, the character of Harry Houdini is played by a guy who is not very good, and the movie is not very good either. The acting is bad, the script is bad and the special effects are bad. It is not a good movie.

 I was looking forward to seeing this film, but I was disappointed. I thought the plot was interesting, and some of the characters were fun, but the movie itself was not interesting. It was a little too slow and boring. I can't see the draw of this movie. My husband laughed at some of the lines. I think the movie is a little tough to sell to young teens, as the sex and violence is pretty explicit.

I thought the movie would be more like a musical. I think it has a lot of potential. I see that this movie is based on a novel, which I hope means that the novel is a lot more interesting. I hope that the movie will be better than the novel.

I think that this movie will appeal more to adults than teens.

I would give it a 6 for the plot, but for the rest I would give it a 2.

 I think this movie is a load of crap. The acting is horrible, the plot not very good and the story is pretty bad. I don't think this film stands toe to toe with "The Ring" or "The Grudge" (although I don't believe those films are that good to begin with).<br /><br />I can't believe that this movie has won awards. It has nothing going for it except for one or two good scenes (which are very short). Everyone should turn in their voting ballots and vote for the film that deserves to win, not this piece of crap. I don't think this film deserves one vote out of the entire world.

Great Thriller in the Horror Genre

I am not a big fan of horror movies, but I do love a good thriller. And this movie fits the bill of a thriller. There are multiple twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. It moves along at a good pace. I am not sure how well it would work in a theater, but I think it would be an excellent choice for a
 I had been looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, but am very disappointed with the way it has turned out. I agree with the other reviewers that the film is not nearly as bad as the general media would have you believe.<br /><br />The story about the murder of a black man at the hands of white racists is a first-rate starting point for an interesting film. The aim of the film is to establish a relationship between the black man, a father, and his son, a college student. The son's girlfriend is white and the film's attempt to establish a racial relationship between the father and son is lost because the film is so heavy-handed in its efforts to make the father-son relationship "better". The film is also very heavy-handed in its attempts to establish a relationship between the girlfriend and the son. The film is not subtle in its attempts to establish these relationships. The film is also not subtle in its efforts to make the white racists "look bad". The film's attempt to make the white racists "look bad" is so heavy-handed that it makes the film's attempts to establish the father-son relationship look even worse. The film's very heavy-handed attempt to make
 I have never seen any of the other Three Stooges movies. This one was not the best. These are the same jokes that were used in the earlier movies, but they seem to have lost their punch. I think that this is one of the few that I have seen in which Joe Besser did not have a role. He had a face like a horse's butt, and was always making fun of his own face. The early ones were much better.

I didn't like the way that they used the "Hello Dolly" song. It was too long, and it was the same old song. They could have made it a different one. I would have liked to see the Stooges do old-time music or something.

I think that the movie was not a good one, but I still like it because I am a fan of the Stooges.

The Three Stooges are the quintessential team of the silent film era. The three men starred in over 200 short and feature films, many of which today are considered classics. The Three Stooges were the original
 This is a very silly and very bad movie. It has a lot of problems. First of all, people are saying the movie is a remake of the classic "The Shining". Well, it is not. The movie is a remake of the classic "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" combined. This movie was also supposed to be a sequel to "Scream". "I Know What You Did Last Summer" was about a girl that was all about revenge for the death of her father. "Scream" was about a girl that came back from the dead, and the people that made her die again. Now, this movie is about a girl that comes back from the dead, and she wants revenge on the people that made her die again. This movie is just ridiculous. There is a lot of violence in this movie, and a lot of people are killed. This movie is a lot like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but a lot more blood. This movie is also a lot like "Friday the 13th". There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie, and a lot of people are killed. This movie is a lot like "Saw", but a lot more blood and gore
 I'm not sure what to say I'm a huge fan of the original Superman and I love the Christopher Reeves version so I expected this to be a masterpiece but it was a complete and total disaster. The acting was horrible, the plot was terrible, the special effects were laughable and worst of all the editing was just horrendous. If you want to see a good Superman movie then watch the original and forget about this piece of crap.

A great way to waste an hour and a half of your life.

I'm not sure where to start. The acting was terrible, the story was so dull and boring, the special effects were laughable and worst of all the editing was just horrendous. The whole movie felt as if it was a parody of Superman and instead of being a comedy it was a comedy of errors. The script was extremely bad and the dialogue was so unbalanced they had to take this movie out of the theater and re-edit it. This is a movie that would have been better off not being made at all. Don't waste your time with this one, it's not worth it!

The beginning, when the police are looking for the two men in the white van who were trying to kidnap a girl is pretty good. Then it goes on with the story of the two men, one of them who works at a factory and his wife. The story moves along and then the other guy gets killed, but not by the police. The police are investigating the other guy who was working with the factory guy, but they never find him. The factory guy gets killed, but not by the police. The factory guy's wife is being investigated and the same guy who killed the other guy comes to the office of the factory guy to ask him some questions. The factory guy gets killed, but not by the police. The police are investigating the wife of the factory guy, but they never find her. The wife of the factory guy gets killed, but not by the police.

 This movie is just plain stupid. It has some humor, but it is mostly pathetic. I mean, the way that the "bad guy" gets away with his crime, and then the "good guy" is forced to shoot the good guy he was about to kill, then the "good guy" gets knocked out and the "bad guy" gets away with the money and his car and the "good guy" is left to watch over the dead body of the "bad guy" - How stupid can you get? Oh and the "good guy" saves the "bad guy's" life because of some childhood friendship - what a stupid plot device. This movie was also unbelievably unoriginal. The "good guy" is always forced to undergo some kind of training to be a good shot. The "bad guy" always has some sort of "evil plan" and is always trying to rob some sort of bank or something. The "good guy" always has to take some sort of drug to "help him" and it always makes him into a "super hero" - oh and the "good guy" always gets the girl. But the main problem with this movie is that all the characters have no character. They are all just a
 This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I did not even get past the first part of the movie to find out what was going on, and I don't think I have ever felt so depressed in my life. I have watched a lot of movies, and this is definitely one of the worst. If you have the opportunity to watch this I don't recommend it.<br /><br />One of the worst parts is that the movie never ends. It is like a movie that is never going to end. It is longer than any movie I have ever seen. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to watch an absolutely horrible movie and don't want to see any real gore, then this is the movie for you.

 I have to agree with the comments that this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I don't think that it was a very good movie, but it was better than it deserved to be. The movie was like a boring soap opera. I didn't like the characters and the plot was just a little bit too "bleh" for my tastes. I think that if is made by a more experienced director and writer, like a Martin Scorsese or a John Hughes, then it will be a lot better. For example, the movie had a few funny moments, but it was only a few. The acting was a little bit too "cutesy" for my tastes, but it wasn't bad either. The action was a bit dull and the story was a little bit too simple. This movie is not a bad one, but it wasn't a great one either. I think that you should rent this movie if you're looking for a decent "soap opera".

(spoilers) <br /><br />The movie was about a young boy and a young girl who fall in love with each other, but they can't get together because the girl is engaged to his best friend.
 I have a problem with this film. I saw it at the cinema and it was so bad I couldn't believe it was made. I have been to some of the locations and they really are in the film. I have also read some of the comments on the film and it seems that the people who haven't seen the film can't understand why it was so bad. I have managed to read the comments and I can't understand why some people have seen it and enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it you should.

I'm sorry but I can't comment on this film because I haven't seen it. I'm looking forward to the next film though Dear Nobody

I just saw this film at the cinema and my god it was awful and so bad it's unbelievable. I was so excited about this film but was so disappointed when I saw it. I want to watch it again with my mates when I get the chance but I'm not going to say I didn't like it because it was awful.

I've seen this film, I must admit it was one of the worst films i've ever seen, i've seen the film in the cinema, I thought the film was
 This, like the movie it is based on, "The Last Movie", is a complete and utter waste of time and effort. I am not a fan of the director, but would have at least been willing to give this one a chance. My wife, who is, must have seen it at least twice, and she didn't like it either. I've seen "The Last Movie" and, although it can be a bit pretentious at times, at least it has a plot and a direction. And it has one, albeit a ridiculous one, but it has one. This one, however, is just a collection of random scenes with no plot or direction at all. I guess if you want to watch a gang of random characters go about their lives, this is the movie for you. But I didn't watch it for that. I wanted to see some movie. I wanted to see a plot. I wanted to see something meaningful.<br /><br />There are a couple of good scenes in this movie. One is the dogfight in the beginning, which is beautifully shot. The other is the opening scene, which I don't even want to spoil for you. Other than that, there are too many other scenes that
 I am a huge fan of the original "Ugly Betty" series, and I'm a fan of the character of Betty. I kept seeing actress Ashley Jensen mentioned as the actress for the new "Betty", and I got totally excited. I love Ashley Jensen's acting, and I have high hopes that she would bring an interesting, new take on Betty. Unfortunately, my hopes were not met.<br /><br />Betty is a total mess. She has the same attitude that she had in the original series. She is a bit snobby, and not down-to-earth at all. Even her relationships with friends, co-workers, and family are the same as they were back in the '90s, and they are all irritating. I was hoping that her final relationship with her father would be different, but instead, it was more of the same.<br /><br />Ashley Jensen's acting was good, but the character of Betty was not. I just can't stand her. I didn't laugh at all throughout the entire show. I was bored and exasperated for the entire two hours. I can't believe that this is the same Ashley Jensen that I loved so much in "Ugly Betty
 This is an awful sequel to a great movie. I saw the first one a year ago, and fell asleep. I really liked the first film and it was a disappointment to see how bad this one was. There was absolutely no reason for any of the characters to have changed, and even the actors playing the same characters from the first one were awful. I would have hated to watch it with someone who had never seen the first one, because I'm sure they would have thought the first one was awful. The only reason I didn't give it a rating of 1 was because the first one was so good. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.

0/10.

*P.S. I saw the first one on DVD, with an additional scene, and it was better.

 The only reason I can think of to watch this film is to see how John Travolta got in his role. I saw him in it, and it is indeed funny. I remember the scene where he is trying to look like a Mexican in the bar, being told he doesn't look Mexican, and he says "but I speak Spanish." There are a few other scenes I remember, like where he explains to the girl how he's going to get her money back, and he's just too nice too say things like "I'm going to beat you up." Also, he is so bad at impersonating Mexican, he can't even get his accent right. He's supposed to be from the Southwest, but sounds like he was from New York. I would have given this a 2, but for the fact that it's a comedy. Next time, I'm renting something else.

5.0 out of 5 stars A great comedy. Format: DVD | Verified Purchase If you're looking for a great movie to laugh at, this is definitely it. The plot is a little weak, but you'll still laugh at this one. It's a bit of a remake of "American Pie" but I think it
 After seeing this film, I just want to get in touch with "The Director". He/she has to be one of the most sickest people I have ever seen. John Cusak is on a roll with his direction. He is being compared to Quentin Tarantino and he will never ever be able to surpass him. All he has put out is just plain stupid and it will take a long time before anyone will ever think he is a good director. The movie is so bad I cannot even watch it. It is like the director is on a mission to make people hate John Cusak and when he does, we will find out who he really is. This is a total waste of time and I have heard a lot of hype about this movie and it is just plain stupid. Go and rent "Six Days Seven Nights" it is a lot better and it is about his character, who is the character that he is in the movie.

I have been thinking about this movie for a while now. I have seen it and I have heard a lot of mixed reviews about it. I have to say that it is a very hard
 It's a pretty cool movie, but it's not really a religious movie. It's more of a movie about the complexities of spirituality and human nature. The ending is fantastic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great movie that doesn't have a lot of sex, but does have a great ending.

 What?<br /><br />A film about the "kids" that can't have sex? Really?<br /><br />I have to say that I was extremely disappointed in this film. I can't say I totally understood the premise or the plot, but I did realize that two friends played by two very attractive young men were going to have sex. I was kind of irritated that the sex scene was not longer, but I was even more irritated that all the characters in this film were completely unbelievable, and that the dialogue was incredibly stupid.<br /><br />This is a film that made me think, "Wha? What?" more than any other film I have ever seen. It was a film that I wanted to like, but could not, and it was a film that I thought I could watch no more than once.<br /><br />If you are looking for a film that will make you think, look elsewhere.

The film
 When I saw the trailer for 'Straw Dogs' I thought this film would be great. Who would say no to David Hull's performance as a psychotic, twisted, psychopathic killing machine? As it turns out, I was wrong. The director and writer, Sam Peckinpah, gave us a bad movie that was far too dark, gory and violent for a movie from the 1960's. Peckinpah made the classic mistake of trying to modernize a classic film, by making it more violent and gruesome than it was in the original. The movie was subject to the criticism heaped on the original film and it's directors, but I think he went too far. The violence to the characters in this movie is also over the top and unnecessary. There was no need to show a woman being disemboweled or a woman's head being split in half. The film is also far too long. Peckinpah could have cut half an hour of this movie and it would have been a better film.

I would highly recommend that anyone see 'Straw Dogs' but only after they have seen the original. It's a classic.

 I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of the old Universal films of the 30's and 40's. However, I must admit that I was just a bit disappointed with this film. I almost feel that this film has lost a little of its magic. I'll give it a 7 out of 10.<br /><br />The story itself was good, but seemed to lack some of the romance and magic of old films. I think that the story did have a good ending, but it was just a little to abrupt. <br /><br />The scenery and scenery was beautiful. However, the music seemed to be a little over done. The sound track did seem to "over do it" a little.<br /><br />The acting in this film was excellent. I like the fact that these old films still have the same "feel" to them as they did when they first came out.

The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the old Universal films were so "magical." I guess they've just lost a little of the magic.

Having said that, I give this film a 7 out of 10.

~By the way,
 You know, I have never really been a fan of the films of the "Saw" franchise, but apparently everyone else is, so I decided to give them a go. I was a little surprised to see this one would now be a prequel, as the original film was the first one released. I have seen the original Saw film once and the original Saw II film once, so I know that the original saw was a prequel to the first one. As far as the prequel goes, I have to say I was a little disappointed. There was a lot of talking and not enough film. There was barely any blood and there was a lot of naked girls. I know that this is a horror movie, but I was expecting more. One good thing I can say, is that there were some good twists to the film, although I was expecting more. This film did not do much for me. I didn't even bother to finish it and I am pretty sure I will not be getting the third one either. I will say one thing though, I would like to thank the director for making the original Saw film, because that one had a lot of blood and gore and a lot of twists, which I also enjoyed.
 This movie is about as slow, boring, and pointless as a movie can be. Director Mark Waters (who also wrote the script, although the actors wrote their own parts) was reportedly inspired by the book "Six Degrees of Separation" by John Guare. However, the resemblance between the movie and the book is only superficial. The book, which I have already read, is a masterpiece that explores the social relationships between people in New York. This movie, on the other hand, is more like a lesson in how NOT to make a film, as it is filled with conversations that are boring, cliched, and pointless. The actors who were not given much screen time were not given any lines that would have made them interesting. If you are looking for a movie that is actually funny, then this is not the movie for you. It is, however, an excellent lesson in how NOT to make a movie.

<br /><br />The story is pretty boring. Basically, the main character is a young man who is trying to make his way in the world, and is also dealing with his family. The story is about as interesting as a sentence that begins with the word "and." The movie does have
 I don't know what it is about these movies that I have a hard time watching. I can't quite put my finger on it. No, I think it's more than that, it's just that I get bored and irritated watching a movie like this. It's just an uninteresting movie with a cast of people I feel nothing for - but I guess that's the point. I think the basic story is a good one, but the execution by the writers is terrible.<br /><br />And that's the reason for my rating. This movie gets an 8 out of 10 on the "boredom meter".

I had high hopes for this movie, but I was left a little dissapointed. I found the trailer to be quite intriguing, and was excited to see it. However, the outcome was very disappointing. I just don't think the movie did it's story justice. The movie also didn't feel very believable. The characters were just so flat
 I'm not sure whether to be offended or not. I saw this film on a movie channel and decided to watch it. It was so bad I had to watch it again. And again. And again. And again. The acting was so bad I couldn't believe it. There were so many lines that were totally unbelievable that I just laughed out loud. The characters were so one-dimensional it was unbelievable. This was a big disappointment for me, since I love the original. But I will say that the music was fantastic. The rest of the movie, not so much. I wish I could rate it zero, but I can't, so I'll give it 2 out of 10 stars.

 Just finished watching this movie, and it really is a waste of time and should be avoided at all costs. It's painfully bad and probably not even worth the two hours it took to watch. I was so bored I wanted to throw myself out the window. I wouldn't even have watched it if I hadn't paid for it, but it wasn't worth the money. Just skip this movie and spend your time on something that's actually worthwhile.

I just finished watching this movie and have to say that I am disappointed. I was expecting a bombastic, violent, and at times gratuitous film. I was expecting a film that would make me want to get off the street, get a gun and start shooting people. Instead, I got a story that was boring and slow. It had a few good scenes, but the overall film lacked any real excitement. I was bored throughout the film and was relieved when it ended. It is one of the few films I have watched where I found myself in the middle of the film without something to look forward to. I would not recommend this film to anyone unless you are a fan of the film
 This is the worst movie I have seen in years....<br /><br />I was watching the movie for about 30 minutes and I said to myself "this is the worst movie I have seen in years". And I watched it again later on and it is still the worst movie I have seen in years.<br /><br />The set up and start of this movie is as bad as it can get. You see this movie and you think "Wow, they really went there with this movie" and you watch the rest of the movie and think "Wow, they really went there with this movie".<br /><br />The acting is bad and the characters are bad. And the plot is bad and the story is bad. This is the worst movie I have seen in years. And I am going to see it again to see if it is still the worst movie I have seen in years.<br /><br />If you have the time, do not watch this movie.

If you're looking for a good horror movie you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a good crime movie you will be disappointed.

 I'm sorry to say that this film has the worst acting and dialogue I've ever seen. The worst acting I've ever seen in any film, let alone a horror film. The script is poorly written, the acting is horrible, the camera is shaky and the film is poorly edited. There are no good scenes in this film, only bad ones. And the film is only 30 minutes long, what the hell. I would never recommend this film to anyone, it's a waste of your time and money. This film is so bad that I couldn't even finish it. I just stopped watching it and started to think of things I could do, I couldn't think of a thing to do, then I left the house. So don't waste your time and money on this movie, or you might as well burn it in your fireplace.

 I was hoping to see a good movie of this type, but this is one of the worst I've seen. As usual, the acting is horrible. The story is not believable, and the plot is quite absurd. What a waste of time.<br /><br />There's no plot, no suspense, no intrigue. It's just a long, boring story of a guy who has a crush on a girl, and then kills her in an effort to get her back. He gets his wife mad at him because he won't tell her where he's been. It looks like the main character is a real whacko. The plot is a totally irrational and sadistic one.<br /><br />The ending is not very good. You never get any idea what is happening. The only thing that makes you feel better is that this woman was probably a total bitch.

This is not a masterpiece of film-making. But it is a movie that will stay with you. The
 Worst film I have ever seen in my life. Bottom of the barrel. I give it a 1/10. It doesn't deserve even that. The worst film I have ever seen. In my opinion, there was a big mistake in the casting of this film. The lead actor was not up to par. There was no chemistry at all. The lead actor was also not able to convey his emotions. The director should have done a better job choosing the right actor for this role. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Horrible, horrible. There was no point in watching the movie. I feel that the director should have never gotten the movie made. It was a complete waste of time and money. I didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It was absolutely boring and pointless. There was nothing interesting whatsoever. There was no suspense at all. The only thing that kept me going was the fact that I had to finish the movie. I don't think I would ever recommend this movie to anyone. Don't waste your time or money on this film. It was a complete failure. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't know how I am going to survive this.


 This movie is not even worth viewing, it is terrible. I bought it for a dollar and wasted my time. It's a typical horror movie with a blonde girl who is fighting for her life. She looks like a young girl, but her voice sounds like a man. The special effects are horrible, and the storyline is weak. The movie is full of clichés. It is an English language movie, and the English accents are not very good. I have seen better horror movies than this one. Don't bother.

 I love that this movie is a low budget, independent affair. It is only seven minutes long and it is so bad that it is actually good. It is a great horror movie.<br /><br />It is a homage to the old, weird, strange independent horror movies of the 1990's, like Black Sabbath or Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. It is also a shocker in that it does not have a big budget, it is not a remake, it's not a sequel, and it was not even made by a major studio. It features one of the most disgusting, disturbing and disgusting and disturbing scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It is so strange, so bizarre, and so bizarrely bizarre that it is so confusing, it is so confusing that it is actually all too confusing, in a good way, in a weird way, in a bad way, in a good, bad way, way.<br /><br />There are some weird scenes in this movie, like how the main character is naked in the beginning of the movie and goes around naked for the rest of the movie, or how there is a scene where the main character, who is a young women, is unknowingly being watched
 This movie is just a rip off of "The Omen" (the original) with a different ending. The story is not very good, the acting is terrible, and it's just boring. I am guessing that this movie was made for teens who don't know any better, but somehow I doubt this. I couldn't stand watching it for more than 10 minutes at a time. This movie would be a hit with 13 year olds who are out of their heads on drugs. I won't watch it again, and I'm not sure if I want to watch the original.

A very interesting movie about a group of people who are trying to survive in a world that is at war with itself. It's about one group of people who are trying to stop the war. The film is excellent, and I think that it is destined to become a favorite. Here are some of the highlights from the movie.

The acting is excellent, the story line is great, and the effects are fantastic. This is definitely one of the best movies I have
 I first saw this when I was about 11 years old, and after all these years, I really can't remember anything about it! It was quite shocking, to say the least, and I was amazed by the fact that I was watching a movie made in the 1950s. It had a few catchy tunes, and a few other things that made it a little interesting. I was very disappointed, however, when I found out that the movie had been filmed in the 1920s. I can't imagine that anybody could enjoy this movie. It's not very entertaining, and the music seems to have been put in to appeal to people who are not very hip. I haven't seen any of the other songs in the film, and I'm not sure if they're any better than the first. I would recommend this film only to people who are really into the 1920s, and I would say that it's probably a good idea to watch this movie if you're an old lady. I would give this movie 1 star out of 10.

*If you're thinking of reading this review in the future, you should know that I'm only 12 and I couldn't think of better words to describe the movie. I've never read a
 Klaus Kinski is a phenomenal actor. He has the ability to take any role and play it like it's the best role of his life. It's not a surprise that he is the best of the best in the acting world. He does it all. He has acted in every genre of film and he has been one of the most successful actors in the history of the industry. He's not right for every role, but he is always right for the right role. He is simply one of the best actors ever. The movie that he was offered to star in was a bad movie. It was known as "The Last of the Mohicans" and the director was Michael Mann. The movie was based on the novel of the same name. The novel was one of the most popular novels in the history of American literature and it was the major reason why the movie was made. When the movie was made, it was a huge success. The movie was a huge commercial hit. It was one of the top grossing movies of 1993. The movie was about five Mohican men who are on their way to the American frontier to join their tribe. They are joined by a young white woman named Maguire (Angelina Jolie). She
 This movie is about as bad as it could be. A few of the actors have nice chemistry together and the plot is interesting but it is terribly over-edited and the script is terrible. It's worst when the film just seems to stop moving and the actors aren't even acting. It's like the director was so concerned with getting in as many jokes as possible that he forgot to tell the actors to act. The only good thing about this movie is that it's only 90 minutes long and it's over before you realize how bad it is. The only things that are good are the two leads and the two or three good scenes but this movie is so bad that I don't think I'd even recommend it.

 I enjoyed the first few episodes of this series, but then it started to get really annoying. I found it hard to listen to the characters constantly yell at each other. The plot lines were not that interesting and the way the characters behaved was just plain annoying. I have no idea why I even bothered to finish the series; it really wasn't that good.

About the only thing I liked about the series is that it featured a bisexual character. I think that was a nice touch and it was just one of the many reasons I didn't give up on this show.

Recommended for people who are really into gay fiction, but I really don't recommend this series to anyone else.

I give this series a 3 out of 10.

 This movie is terrible. The acting is awful, the plot is weak and the direction is a disgrace. The story is ludicrous, so what is going on? What is the point of the movie?<br /><br />A man is shot in the back and the killer is fleeing away. The police are not able to find him. Then he is discovered and wounded by an ambulance. He escapes because he is shot. Then he is found again. He is found again and once again he escapes. Then he is found in the police station where he is arrested.<br /><br />The film begins with a woman taking her daughter to school. She is a doctor. She takes her daughter to school and she is shot in the back and killed. Then the killer is escaping away and the police are after him. Then the killer is wounded by an ambulance. Then he is found again and once again he escapes. Then he is found in the police station where he is arrested.<br /><br />The secret to this movie is that it was made in a hurry and by people who had never seen a movie made before.

The acting is terrible. The plot is uninteresting and weak. The direction is a disgrace.
 I have to say, I am a fan of the 80's/90's TV series "Gilligan's Island", so I figured I would give this movie a try. I was very disappointed, I'd say worse than "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Some of the jokes are very unfunny, and the storyline is not that good. I would only recommend this to the most die hard fan of the TV series, otherwise it's better to just rent the TV show.

I give this movie a 2/10.

7/10 for the fun of it

1/10 for the storyline

2/10 for the overall film

I was looking for a good laugh and then I came across this movie. The first time I saw it I was pretty disappointed but the second time I've seen it on TV I laughed my head off. I guess it's because I knew all the gags and jokes the first time around. I can't really explain why I like it so much but I do. The movie was funny and the cast was good. The storyline was okay but it wasn't the best thing ever and it wasn't
 I had been looking for a good horror movie to watch, and this one came up in the search. I was hoping for a good story and some good scares, but I got neither. I was very disappointed in this movie. I can't believe that a movie with a good concept and a great cast would be so bad. I was really hoping for a great Halloween movie to watch this year, but this movie definitely didn't deliver. The acting was horrible, the story was boring and pretty predictable, and the characters were bland. I was expecting a little more from this movie, and I found it to be very disappointing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I think I will stick to a good movie like Scream 3 or Friday the 13th to watch over the next few weeks.

<br /><br />I give this movie a 2 out of 10

 So I rented this movie and was sort of disappointed. Its a big budget movie with good actors but the movie is hard to follow and the story line is hard to follow. I have seen better movies along the lines of this one. Its a cool idea but the movie doesn't deliver. Who would have thought that it would take so much money to make a movie that was not believable in the least. Some of the action scenes are not very good. The movie tries to be funny a lot and it just comes off as funny. I think it would have been better off if it was just a straight action movie. The sound I thought was OK but not the best. Overall it was a good movie that I would recommend to those who are into that type of movie. I just think it was kind of a shame that there was not much that was realistic about it.

 I don't think this movie is bad, I just think it is boring. I think this movie would have worked much better if it had a completely different premise. I think it would have worked much better if they had a little more action, a little more adventure, and a little more romance.

 Yes, this is indeed a film about a kid of a very rich family who is brought up in a very strict manner. He is brought up with his sister and taught to be of a very high and moral standard. The film is about a kid who has some "special" talents and is brought up to be a real fast-learner. He is also not allowed to do anything that is not in the line of duty or so to speak. He is not allowed to go out of the house (without the permission of his sister in law). He is not allowed to have any friends. He is not allowed to do anything that may involve him in negative aspects. Now he is in the year of his 10th birth-day and all of this is about to change, he is going to be given a challenge that he must accept and overcome. All, thanks to some "help" from his mother in law. And one more thing, he must be careful and not get noticed, he must not get arrested or anything like that, or he will be punished. So it's a story of a boy, who is brought up strictly, he is trained to be of a moral standard and he is told that he is not allowed to
 This movie is awful. The acting is laughable and the plot is a mess. I don't know why I watched this movie because it just sucked. The best part about this movie was the bad guy. I'm not a big fan of action movies but the action scenes in this movie were the best part. Overall, this movie sucks. But if you like movies that are bad, watch this one.

 I have to say that I was really excited to see this film after seeing a few of the trailers on the big screen and on TV. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. I don't think that the film is all that bad, but it is certainly not anywhere near up to the "big screen" standards set by the likes of Speilberg, Lucas and Coppola. I mean, I can deal with the fact that this movie is low budget and not as interesting as the average film, but why did they have to be so incredibly boring? The film is all over the place. Scenes that are supposed to be funny, are not. Scenes that are supposed to be scary, are not. I have seen this film twice and I don't understand why I bothered to sit through it the second time. The movie makes no sense and the characters are not believable. I was very disappointed.

I'm looking forward to seeing "Alien" in a few days and I'm hoping that it is much better than this film.

I know that I am in the minority on this one, but I think that more people will dislike this film after seeing it.

 This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't even finish this film because I found it so offensive. I am a fan of the band Van Halen, but I can't believe that this film was made about them. Eddie Van Halen was a genius, a musical genius, but then I guess he had to be portrayed as an a**hole who was never home. His wife, the lead character, was portrayed as a "home wrecking" type. When I read the plot, I was like "Oh, come on!" The only redeemable thing in this movie was the guitar playing and the singer, but let's face it, they are all just actors and actresses. This movie is probably the worst thing I've ever seen, but I am glad that I wasted my time watching it.

I loved it. 9/10. I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. The characters were great. I really liked the whole "rock and roll dad" thing. Sometimes, I feel like my dad over reacts to things, but this movie showed me that I would have felt that
 I really don't know how to start this review...<br /><br />I loved the first one. I rented it because I liked the original, but still managed to enjoy the sequel. I looked forward to this one, and even though it was another great adaptation of a book, I was still hoping for something different.<br /><br />It was just too much like the first. The kids were too much like the kids in the first movie. Almost to the point where they were annoying. The only thing that set this movie apart was the fact that the kids were even worse.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but it just didn't do it for me. I was disappointed. I would have loved for them to do a third one, but unfortunately, I think it would have been just as bad as this.

<br /><br />On a side note, the only actor to not irritate me in the movie was John Amos. I loved him in the first movie, and I think he did a wonderful job. The rest of the people in this movie were annoying.

<br /><br />It was too much like the first for me, and
 This movie is so bad that it is almost unwatchable. The acting and dialogue is terrible, the plot is stupid and the special effects are laughable. I've never seen a movie so bad. I mean, the acting is so bad that even I couldn't laugh at it. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but his acting in this movie is just flat out garbage. He looks half asleep and dead on many occasions. The action scenes are laughable, and the special effects look like they were done in a few hours with a few friends on a deadline. I can't believe that this movie was made. I don't understand why the director chose to go the route of a poor imitation of the Matrix. He should have just gone with the whole idea and made a movie that was full of action and not a bunch of computer graphics from another movie. I hate it when movies go for the same idea as another movie and try to make it better. That's exactly what this movie does. The whole time I was watching this movie, I kept thinking that it was a poor imitation of the Matrix. It's just that bad. I don't know what else to say so I'll just leave it at this. I
 I can't say I've ever read a book so full of holes and inconsistencies. I've read the whole series and I still can't believe how poorly put together this whole thing is. The action scenes are poorly written and edited, and the plot itself is just a huge jumble. I can't even imagine how it is possible for anybody to sit down and write this story, then have the guts to publish it. The movie literally makes no sense at all. The whole thing is just so poorly written and edited, and the characters are all so horribly out of character. The only character you could even remotely trust is the Goth chick, who is so out of place and so amazingly out of character I can't even imagine what they were thinking. The whole thing is just so poorly put together, I can't believe they actually published it. Anybody who reads this book and is interested in a good movie, I would strongly advise you to skip it altogether. If you want a good book, I suggest you read The Hunger Games, or Harry Potter, or even Game of Thrones, just not this one. It's all just so poorly put together and I can't believe a publisher would even let this get published. I see a lot
 Don't get me wrong, I love the original "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" as much as anyone else, but I have to admit, this movie is seriously flawed. I know the film is meant to be a parody, but it just didn't work for me. Paul McCartney's character is a caricature of himself, and the band's stage costumes (and the film itself) are just plain silly. But I can overlook that, because I enjoy the Beatles so much, I really don't care about the style of their films. I'm just not sure about the script, though.<br /><br />The band members are portrayed as very uncouth, and the film is nearly devoid of humor. It's just not a very good movie.<br /><br />I just wish there had been less of the new songs, and more of the old.

 The film seems to be about a high school teacher who is a pervert. He's a bit of a loner, but he has a relationship with a young student.<br /><br />I could not even make it a whole hour through this film. It was so boring. I was looking for the "excitement" of the plot, but I never found it. The furtive glances between the teacher and the student seemed to be the "excitement." The teacher's imagination was off the charts in this one. He was constantly doing things in the classroom that were inappropriate. He was looking through the student's desk. He was looking through the student's locker. He was looking at the student's underwear while they were changing.<br /><br />It was like a "slumber party" with the teacher and the student, but the plot was just boring. <br /><br />I realize that this is a "soft-core" film, but I just couldn't stand it. I would advise that you avoid this one.

 I was a big fan of the original "Some Like It Hot" and the "Stuntman" remake was pretty decent. The original was over-the-top fun, while the remake was just a little too serious.<br /><br />I could have forgiven the remake if they'd just made the lead characters gay. I mean, that's the point of the original, anyway. But the remake is told from the perspective of the straight girl with the occasional moment of gayness from the two men. And that makes me want to puke!<br /><br />*sigh* I don't know, maybe I'm missing the point of this. I just wish they'd gone with the original and made it a story about a straight girl who falls in love with a gay man. I mean, the original was about two men falling in love with the same woman! How can you make that movie without the two lead characters being gay?

Reviewer Score: 3

 the original is better than this

I have seen this movie twice. I thought it was very funny the first time. I thought it was great the second time. I found myself laughing more than I thought I would. I think that
 This movie is an absolute piece of junk. The acting is terrible, the story line is ridiculous, and the special effects are abysmal. There is no point to this movie. The only thing it had going for it was a decent cast of actors. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you want to waste a couple of hours of your life. I know this is a direct to video movie, but if you want to see a good movie, I would suggest rent one.

I rented this movie to see it and then returned it. I didn't think it was very funny. I tried checking out the cast and did not recognize any of the actors or the writers. It was a pretty boring movie. Some of the acting was ok, but the plot wasn't very good.

 What a joke of a film. I saw this film because I was asked to be part of the audience for it. I was about to leave and I said, "I'm not going to take part in this film. I'm not going to stand here and watch this film. I'm not going to come to this film and watch it."<br /><br />I went out of the cinema and actually passed a man in a van that was parked outside and I said, "What was that film?" and he said, "I don't know. I've never seen it before." And I thought, "Wow! What a film." And I thought, "Well, this is the end of cinema." And I thought, "I must have seen the worst film of all time." And I thought, "I'm going to go and read some books on cinema and see how I can get a job in a film industry. I'm going to be a film critic." And I thought, "I'm going to go and see some films that are actually worth watching."

And thank God I did. I saw The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. I saw The Grey Zone by Andre
 I can't make heads or tails of the plot of this movie.

 I've seen many movies in my life, and I've seen this one a few times in the theater, and actually had a friend who lived in the neighborhood of the movie studios as a kid who had actually been on the set and was able to bring me a free DVD of it.<br /><br />It's kind of a cute story of a family that's living in a small, isolated town on the edge of the Mojave desert. One of the children has been diagnosed with leukemia, and it's up to his family to decide whether or not they should drive him to a major medical center, or take him to a local facility that's run by a group of Mormon missionaries. It's a good story, but the movie itself is very weak. The acting is very bad, and the dialog is terrible. It's not really a comedy, but it is a comedy, and in fact, the whole movie is an unintentional comedy.<br /><br />If you want to see a good comedy, see "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure".

<br /><br />The only reason I gave it an 8 is because it does have a message about how cruel life can be, and how hard it is
 This movie is a boring and uninspired rip-off of the original "The Hunt for Red October". Don't believe me? Get the original instead. I am a Navy pilot, and I flew the F-14. I am not a fan of Tom Clancy, and I don't like movies about Navy pilots. I have seen the original, and have read the books. This movie is nothing like them. The first half of the movie is about Navy pilots. The second half of the movie is about the Russian subs. There is no reason to make this movie. I have seen a lot of bad movies, and I have seen a lot of bad Navy movies. This one is the worst of both worlds. Don't waste your money on it. It is also sad to see Tom Clancy's name attached to such a bad movie.

 I have to be honest in saying that I have never been a fan of westerns but this film has changed that. I love this film. <br /><br />I'm not sure if it was the excellent performances or the superb story telling but this film is a must see. It is a western adapted to the modern world with a twist and it works.<br /><br />The story is excellent. So simple but so effective. It is a story that we can all relate to. A guy that loses everything he has because of one mistake. He must now find his place in the world and this is a great film to watch on a Friday night. It is entertaining and entertaining is good. <br /><br />The acting is excellent, it is the same with all the actors and actresses involved in the film. I know that there are no big names in the cast but to me that is a bonus. This is a film that is based on the performers and it is still going down in my top ten. The actors are all great and the music is excellent. <br /><br />I recommend this film to everyone. It is excellent. Go and see it. It is a film that I will watch
 I liked the first two movies of this series, but this one just wasn't one of the good ones. I thought the first two were very good and the characters were believable, so it's a shame that this one was the weakest of the three. There's a lot of bad acting and the characters are pretty unbelievable.<br /><br />It was quite hard to follow the plot. I understood that they were both on the run from the police and were also trying to find out who killed their parents, but I felt that the movie moved very slowly. The characters didn't really develop and the story didn't really have a climax or conclusion. It was just a series of random events and too much time spent on characters we didn't care about. I wanted to know what happened, but the focus was too much on the characters and the story was lost.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the acting, but it wasn't all bad. I liked the first two movies and I thought the actors were good, but they did a poor job in this movie, like they didn't feel comfortable with the characters. The acting was just too bad and they didn't really fit the characters. They didn't have the charisma
 This movie is terrible. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is so bad, that I couldn't finish watching it. I didn't want to give up on it, but I had to, because I was so upset. I wish I knew how to make it so I can send it back to the director and give him a piece of my mind. This movie is so bad, I wanted to know how to get it out of my DVD player, but I didn't know how, so I had to watch it to the very end. The movie tells the story of five people, who are in the middle of a war. The movie shows the events of their lives, and their life together. But the movie wasn't good, the characters weren't good, and the movie wasn't funny, so I won't give it any stars for the acting. The movie just made me feel bad, because it was so bad. I don't know how a person can make a movie this bad, but I wish they got what they deserved. The movie doesn't make sense, and it's boring, so I won't give it any stars for that. I don't know what else to say, other than
 Let me start by saying that I love Nick Cage. I think he's one of the most interesting actors of the past 20 years. I think he is a talented actor. I think he's even funny. But that is all irrelevant. This movie, one of the few bad ones along with Training Day, is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only reason I am not giving it a 1 is because there is an amusing scene where Cage's character is trying to get a cell phone out of a woman's bra. And because Cage plays a cop.<br /><br />The plot is so stupid that it defies explanation. I'll try to give it my best shot. A guy who is obsessed with his daughter starts killing people who look like her. He finds out that his daughter is a cop and he kills her as well.<br /><br />And that is it! I can't believe that anyone who has read this far has spent the time to watch this atrocious movie. I am not sure if this is supposed to be a comedy or a thriller or what. It's just one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen.

 This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the first 2 movies, and I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD, but I will not be purchasing it. The entire time I was watching it, I was thinking, "How did they forget to tell me that this movie was supposed to be a sequel to the first 2 movies?" The first two movies are so good and so original, that I couldn't believe that this movie could compare. The acting, the writing, the plot, the story line, everything is so bad. It made me sad to watch. I don't know how this movie even got made, it was so bad, it was hard to watch. I would not recommend this to anyone.

<br /><br />I hope this never gets on DVD, because if it does, I will be really upset. I am going to try to get a hold of the first two movies, and see how bad the third one is. I don't think I will ever be able to watch it again. If I do, it will just be for fun, and I don't think I will ever be able to watch it again. If you watch
 This was the third movie I rented from Blockbuster, the first two being The Punisher and a few weeks later, The Punisher II.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this movie when I rented it. I was excited to see a movie with a great word-of-mouth rating and I was looking forward to seeing the first Punisher movie. I liked the first Punisher movie but I thought it was a little long.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to find that this movie was just as long as the first Punisher movie. It was very similar in plot and action. The only difference was that this Punisher movie had a lot more bad language.<br /><br />I was also surprised by how much the Punisher movie was like the The Punisher comic book. I thought that this movie would have a different plot than The Punisher comic book. I was also surprised by the plot of the first Punisher movie. I thought that this movie would be a little more original and different.<br /><br />Overall, I found this movie to be a little boring and predictable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you are a fan of the first Pun
 I've seen this movie and in my opinion it was a big disappointment. I loved the first one and thought this one would be just as good. Well it was far from that, in fact it was the complete opposite. The acting wasn't good, the script was awful and the only good thing I can say about it was the music. I'm still trying to find a good reason to see the movie, but it's just not very good at all. I was hoping this was going to be a franchise, but it's not. I'm very disappointed. I guess not everyone will like it as much as I did, but it didn't have to be THAT bad.

<br /><br />P.S. I'm not a big fan of the other movie, but I find myself thinking about it (I'm sure if I'd seen it before this one I'd be just as disappointed).

<br /><br />P.P.S. I think some people don't understand the fact I didn't give the movie a 10. Most 10s are for movies that are really good, and this wasn't one of them. It's just that bad.

<br /><br
 This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I'm not basing this review on the fact that it was made in Japan or that it had subtitles. This movie is horrible. I have watched this movie approximately 8 times, and every time I watch it, I think it's worse than the last. It's so terrible that I can't think of anything else to say. It's so bad that I don't want to write this review. Please, someone tell me it's not true.<br /><br />What is this movie about? I have no idea, but I think it's a romance. There are two people who meet on a train, get off the train and go to a house somewhere. The two people get married and then they go to a house somewhere. I think they're in love, but they don't make clear what they love. They just kiss and then they have sex. Then they go to a house somewhere. I think they have sex again. I think they have sex again. I think they have sex again. I think they have sex again. I think they have sex again. I think they have sex again. I think they have sex again. I think they have
 If you must watch this movie, DO NOT waste your time and money.<br /><br />The script is hard to follow and has some of the worst editing and effects I have ever seen. The CGI looks like something done by a 4th grade student in Microsoft Paint. The acting is sub-par, and the lead actor looks like he is on too much meds.<br /><br />It's as if the director, who's name I am too lazy to look up, was on some kind of LSD trip, writing and shooting this movie.

I am hard pressed to think of anything positive to say about this movie, but I will try.<br /><br />The main character is not bad looking, and the movie has a few nice fight scenes. The problem is that the rest of the movie makes no sense. I am not talking about the story, which is very poorly written and seems to have been written by a high school student. I am not talking about the quality of the special effects, which are so poor that I don't think it is worth discussing. I am not talking about the acting, which is actually pretty good for a movie like this.

What I am talking about is
 I really wish I hadn't seen this movie. I'm usually a big fan of movies with raunchy content and I love movies with all kinds of different fetishes but I've never seen anything so foul as this. It's all about sex, sex, and more sex and the only reason anyone would want to watch this kind of movie is to be able to say that they've done so. The acting is terrible, the film is poorly done, and the script barely makes sense. I think the only reason this is being released is because of the cannibalism and the fact that it's made by the same people who made the equally awful "American Psycho". If you are looking for a good movie to watch then don't waste your time on this.

The worst movie I've seen in a long time.

I'm not sure why I even bothered to watch this movie. I decided to rent some movies on my computer and I was surprised to see this there. I have nothing against cannibal gore flicks, I've seen plenty of them in the past and I've always enjoyed them. I'm not sure exactly why they decided to make this movie though. I
 I'm a huge fan of both De Niro and Pacino and I loved the first two films. I also like a lot of the actors in this movie but this was a terrible film. It was boring, unbelievable and no one cared. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I saw it with a couple of friends and we all hated it. I don't know what happened but after the first two films both De Niro and Pacino were excellent. This one was horrible. I stopped watching it after the first 30 minutes and it was a very long ride.

I don't know why this film got such a high rating but I really don't recommend it.

The movie was very slow and boring and I didn't care about any of the characters. I couldn't even tell who was who. The only reason I can think of to watch it is if you're a big De Niro or Pacino fan.

As for the ending, I was so annoyed by it that I can't even remember it.

There's not much to say about this movie. If you're a big De Niro or Pacino fan I can't say it's a good movie. If
 I just finished watching this movie, and all I can say is WOW, it was so boring and disappointing. I love the first two Matrix movies and have, over the years, grown to look forward to the release of each new Matrix movie. I was so looking forward to The Matrix Revolutions that I actually went out and bought the DVD just to get the extra features. I never expected it to be this bad. The movie was so slow and boring that you almost don't care what happens to the characters or what they are trying to accomplish, or even what is going on. One thing i did notice was that this movie has some of the best special effects i have ever seen, the battle scenes were amazing, but most people though that was the only thing this movie had going for it. I felt so bad for the actors who had to put up with all the bad lines and bad acting, especially Carrie-Anne Moss. She is one of my favorite actresses and i love her in both the Matrix films, but i feel that she had a terrible time filming this one. I think this movie was probably a very bad idea, but i guess i will give it a pass just because i love the Matrix films.

 I have seen this movie several times. Every time I see it, I cringe. This movie is awful. Save your time and energy and do not watch this movie. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the actors are very attractive; however, that's not enough to make a good movie.

I have never seen a movie so stupid. This movie is like a bad version of "The Time Machine". A movie about a time machine. If a movie is about time machines, it is not a good movie. I think that this movie is about a time machine but I'm not sure. The story is not clear at all. It is hard to understand. The story is very confusing and confusing. It is not a good movie about time machines. I think it is a bad movie about time machines.

I think this movie is a bad version of "The Time Machine". The movie is a bad movie about time machines. I think that this movie is a bad movie about time machines. It is a terrible movie about time machines.

 I saw this movie at the cinema. I was totally disappointed by it. I expected much more. The movie is about a young girl who has to go to school, but some how she has to go back to the circus. She has to be a good girl, but she has to be a bad girl too. Just like with the circus. It didn't work at all. There was nothing funny or interesting in the movie. There was a lot of boring stuff in the movie. My favourite character was the old lady on the bridge. It wasn't really funny though, I guess. I think that this movie was bad. I expected something much more. I only liked some parts of the movie. I'm not really sure if I would recommend this movie to someone. The only good thing about this movie was the trailer.

I saw this movie at the cinema. I thought it was a bad movie, but I was wrong. I actually thought it was good. I can't explain why. I just liked it. I don't know why. I didn't like the trailer. I thought it was boring. I thought the movie was about a girl
 If you are a true fan of the LOTR trilogy, this film will make you want to vomit. This film is the worst of the trilogy, the worst of Peter Jackson's career and the worst of the Tolkien canon. The film is supposed to be a sequel to The Two Towers, but it is not at all comparable in any way. The characters, the sets, the story, the acting, it all sucks. The only redeeming quality was the script. It was awful, but it was at least original. The director makes very little use of CGI and the special effects are the only things that save the film. The fact that they totally screwed the original story and writing is unforgivable and shows that Peter Jackson doesn't have any talent. He's simply an opportunist who jumps on the LOTR bandwagon and makes money. But is this film worth the $10-$15 you would pay for it? No, it is not. It should not have happened and it is a disgrace to the LOTR saga. If you want to see the original and best LOTR films, see The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. If you want to see the worst LOTR films, see this and The Return of the
 I don't know how this got such high ratings, especially considering this is a comedy. This movie is so lame. The plot is very predictable, the two leads are so annoying, the dialog is the rudest I've ever heard and the humor is juvenile and lame. The only reason I'm giving it a four is because some of the scenes are very funny, but they are in VERY few scenes. I don't recommend this film at all. It's not even worth renting. It's so bad. Don't even waste your time.

BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! That's all I have to say about that. It's about these two kids, Jon and Kate, who are in the same class at school. They become friends and help each other out. One day, Jon and Kate get pulled over by the cops and the cops think that Jon is drunk and arrested him. Kate gets in trouble because she was driving. It's a great movie about friendship and family. My favorite part is when Jon's dad comes to the school to pick up Jon and Kate and gives them a ride home. All I can
 This movie is just loaded with bad acting, bad editing and bad direction. The whole thing felt like it was designed just to make a quick buck. The story itself was nothing special and the acting was bad.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this from a definite F is the special effects, which aren't bad, just not enough to save the whole thing.

<br /><br />C+

<br /><br />I'm sure most people on IMDb rated this movie positive out of 10, but I didn't. I'm giving it a 3 because there was just something about it that I didn't like.

<br /><br />I could care less about this movie, but I do have to point out that the movie was directed by James Cameron's brother, William (the other one of his brothers who hasn't done much in the business).

<br /><br />I'm not saying that the movie is bad, but I just didn't like it.

<br /><br />Overall, this movie is just a big disappointment. If you like the director's brother, then you might like this movie.

<br /><
 The first half of this is a little disappointing. The second half, however, is GREAT. It's like they just decided to give in to the horror of the first half, and it ends with a bang. I was really pleased. But it really is just a little disappointing. I feel the film makers should have had the courage to stick to their guns, and make it a straight horror film. But I have to say, this is the first film I have seen of this genre in a while that has made me actually laugh. It's not often you laugh while watching a horror film. Well done, Lionsgate.

 *SPOILERS* I'm a big fan of the original "Jaws" and liked "Jaws 2" quite a bit, so I was excited to see the third one when it came out. But, alas, it was not nearly as good as the first two. First, there was absolutely no suspense. You knew exactly what was gonna happen, and it happened to some pretty silly characters. The shark wasn't really scary at all, and the worst part was that it attacked a kid! How pathetic! This film was a complete waste of time, and the only good thing about it was the music, which was nonetheless not all that great. Ignore this movie and save yourself the money.

 You see a lot of films that are strangely amazing for their awfulness. Some movies that have a certain kind of charm, some have the amazing ability to entertain you to the point of laughter, and some films just seem to be there for the sole purpose of being terrible. "Frogs" is one of those films. It's not quite a bad film in the sense of being just awful, but it's certainly the kind of film that deserves to be called awful. It has a bunch of things going for it, and none of them are enough to save it. There are some decent actors in this film, and it's hard to believe that a film with this many talented actors could end up being this bad. It's also got a decent-looking setting, with some interesting looking costumes, and a good-looking, fairly well-lit setting. Unfortunately, the director never has a clue what he wants to do, and the result is a film that is the epitome of annoying, pointless and stupid. The film starts out with a little girl who is running away from some self-appointed witch hunters, who are hunting down witches, who are just people that have the magical ability to see the future. She is beaten and
 The film is essentially a 90-minute "teaser" for the sequel, which in turn was just a trailer for the second sequel. The film features a lot of action sequences, particularly in the beginning and the end, which are reminiscent of the action scenes in the second Indiana Jones film. Given that this is a different incarnation of the film character, some things just don't work as well.<br /><br />The film has a lot of potential, and the entertainment value is not bad. It's just the story (and the script) which is lacking. The film seems to me to be more of a "film-within-a-film" than a story in its own right.<br /><br />Although I've seen the second film in the series, this movie doesn't really add much to the story. I suspect the second film provides a more satisfying conclusion, largely because it's not bogged down in unnecessary action sequences.

 This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's a cheap knock-off of SAW, it feels like a low budget horror movie, and it's as boring as watching paint dry.<br /><br />I know the original SAW was a great movie, and that it was made by some great directors. But this movie has none of those things. It's boring, it's a waste of time, it's not scary and it's too long at over 2 hours. The acting is also very bad, and the script is very bad. It has only one or two good ideas in it, and everything else is just a waste of time.<br /><br />I would only recommend this to people who have nothing better to do, or who are bored and don't know what else to do.

What a rip-off.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I can't believe that a film as bad as this was released. It's not even scary, and the acting
 I'd read some good reviews of this movie so I went to see it. The movie is good and funny but it has a few flaws that make it hard to sit through. The first flaw is that the movie is in the form of a play. However, the whole movie is one long monologue. There's no storyline or action. There is some singing and dancing but only occasionally.<br /><br />The second flaw is that the movie makes a few political statements that are not quite clear. For instance, at one point the lead character, who is a professor of philosophy, says that students should be able to choose their own lecture topics and that instead of giving exams to determine their mastery of the subject, it's better to base the grade on their ability to write a good essay. It's a reasonable point, but the movie does not drive it home and make the audience understand why he is making it.<br /><br />The movie is funny, but it's not laugh out loud funny. It's mostly a slow comedy. I don't think I've laughed out loud at a movie this much in a long time. Most of the jokes make sense, but many of them don't. The main character, for
 Sometimes, you just want to see a movie that is so bad that it's good, and this film is just that.I could have watched a bad porno with a better storyline than this film.The only reason I was able to sit through the whole thing was that there were so few scenes. There are scenes of people getting it on, but there's no plot, no story, no nothing. If you only watch one movie this year, make it "Bob's Burgers."

I did not like the movie very much, but didn't hate it either.I know it was a big hit and it was on cable a lot, but I just don't get it. I'm not a fan of the show, but I liked the first film.I think the first one was supposed to be a spoof of horror films. It was pretty clever, but it was a little too clever for my tastes. The second film I thought was even better than the first. I guess the third one was supposed to be a spoof of action movies, and it was a little better than the second one, but still not on par with the first film. I think the fourth one was supposed to be a
 This is a fine example of those movies that are trying to be "artsy" but are just too stupid to be anything else. Some of the acting was good, but the direction, script and production values were all atrocious. The characters were so utterly predictable and the dialog was trite and full of cliches from Mel Brooks, Woody Allen and Woody Allen again. The "big ideas" were so dumb and the whole movie was so pretentious that it was just plain boring. The only reason I watched half of it is because I have a soft spot for Woody Allen and because I'm a sucker for anything with Richard Dreyfuss in it.

 This movie was horrible. I feel bad for the people who actually believe this is a good movie. I am in disbelief. I wouldn't expect much from a movie called "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" but I though at least it would be fun to watch. Wrong! The movie is so bad that I think it is a waste of time to even watch it. The acting is horrible and the storyline is so bad it makes me believe that the people who wrote the movie must have been high on drugs. This movie is a waste of time, it is so bad I couldn't even get through it. If you are looking for a good movie, look for something else. I really have no idea why this movie is even rated 7.4/10.

I give this movie a 0/10.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2004)
 I've seen this movie a lot, apparently I'm not alone, but I also like to think I know a little about horror movies, and this is one of the worst. I'm not going to get into plot, but what's wrong with this movie is:<br /><br />1. The plot is completely stupid, not really scary. The movie really should have been called "The Stalker" instead of "The Horror". It's not scary at all. It's just a movie that tries to scare you.<br /><br />2. The acting is terrible, the actor playing the stalker is awful. The movie is so hated that the actor can't even get a job in a movie anymore.<br /><br />3. The movie is completely unrealistic<br /><br />4. It's really really boring. I have no idea why anybody would ever want to watch this movie.

End of the line.

1/10

I can't imagine how anybody could watch this movie, it's just not good. I mean I could give it a 2 or a 3, but I wouldn't. I'd give it a 0, or maybe a 1 or a 2
 At first the film is intriguing, lots of the historical facts are correct and one can actually tell what the plot is about. However, after a while, the plot starts to unravel, the plot becomes over-complicated and the whole thing gets really confusing.<br /><br />It also helps that the film is set in a time where one could say the average citizen was as dumb as a rock. A time when a lot of people were illiterate and many didn't even know what a horse was! <br /><br />The film was good to see the historical facts, but the plot itself left a lot to be desired. And while a lot of people, who aren't bothered by historical inaccuracies, might enjoy the film, I found it hard to do so.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too much of a history buff, but I would have liked to have seen a film which had more plot and was more exciting.

 I rented this movie to see how bad it would be.<br /><br />It was very bad. Very, very bad. I'm not sure I could have enjoyed this movie even if it had been made in the '80s. The plot, the acting, the technical aspects...everything was so bad that it was painful to watch.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend it to anyone.

I found myself yelling at the movie at the end, "Come on! Let's get this over with already!" I think I actually wanted to throw up a couple of times.<br /><br />And that's the best thing this movie has going for it: it was painful to watch. I was very disappointed in the overall quality of this movie.

I wish I had read the reviews before I rented this.

I really didn't like it.

I wouldn't recommend it.

I guess I'm glad I rented it, though. It did give me the opportunity to watch a lot of movies I would have never seen otherwise.

 I was so excited for this movie. I had just seen the trailer and it looked so interesting. I am a huge fan of the first movie, and I was hoping that the second movie would be as good. I was very wrong. The first movie was so good because it was not predictable. The second movie was so predictable that it was hard to watch, and it was so hard to watch because all of the characters were so unlikable. The first movie could have been so much worse, but the second movie made the first movie look like a masterpiece. I hope that the third movie will be better than this one, because this one was just awful. I hope that they do not make a third one. I think that the first movie was better than the second one, but this one was worse than the first one. If they do make a third one, I hope that they make it better than this one.

 I'm sorry to say that I truly was disappointed with this film. My expectations for this movie were high. I love the TV series, American Gothic, and was excited to see that the movie was based on a book series by the same name. I was looking for a good film and found it a poor imitation of the TV series. The movie is just too fast paced and has too many characters to keep track of. The movie also has a "campy" feel to it. I think the cast was fine, but the movie just didn't live up to the hype.

I would recommend watching the series instead. There is so much more character development in the movie than the series. It seems the movie was just a rushed attempt to get the first book to the screen. The movie is also very predictable. I have watched the first episode of the series and could have predicted what was going to happen in the first 45 minutes of the movie.

I think that if you have seen the series, this movie is a disappointment.

 I loved The Big Lebowski. It was one of the most original comedies I've ever seen. I think it's a great film, and I enjoyed every minute. I think the Coen brothers are great filmmakers. I'm looking forward to the next one, which I'm told is a crime-drama called Intolerable Cruelty. I've also heard rumors of a remake of The Ladykillers. So, I guess the Coens are doing the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />I have a theory about the film, though, and I don't think it's entirely fair to say that I just don't 'get' it. I think that when people like The Big Lebowski, they're getting the Coens' particular brand of humor. I don't think the Coens are a comedy duo. I think they're more like a comedy triad. The Big Lebowski, myself, and the Coen brothers. I think my tastes are different, and I'm not interested in their particular brand of humor. I think I understand the humor of the film, but I just don't 'get' it.<br /><br />This is probably why I'm not
 I went to see this movie because I had heard the actors in it were great. I really didn't know what to expect. I guess I should have looked up the story of the movie before I left the house. The movie was so bad that I was afraid to leave the theatre. The story was pretty good and the characters were great. But this movie had such horrible acting that I couldn't take it seriously. The movie had several scenes where the actors were pretending to be asleep. They would snore, gag, and roll around. I know that it is a comedy, and I guess that is what they were going for, but I just couldn't stand it. I tried to laugh at the movie, but it was so bad that I couldn't even laugh. The movie was very unrealistic and was a waste of time and money. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

This movie had a lot of potential, but if you don't like to laugh at bad acting, then you should avoid this movie.

 I thought this was a decent movie and I can see how some people wouldn't like it, but I loved it. The ending was a little anti-climatic but I still loved the movie (I'm a horror movie nut). It was pretty much a combination of the first two movies, and I think if you liked the first two then you will love this one. I think what saved it for me was the fact that it was short, it was only about 90 minutes long and in this day and age it's hard to find that. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror movie.

When I watched this movie I was expecting the whole thing to be a prequel but it was actually a sequel. I'm a bit confused as to why they made the main title so similar to the name of the first two movies but anyways, I really enjoyed this movie.

 This movie is a real low point in the career of director Roger Corman. The film is confusing, the characterizations are horrible, and the performances are just plain awful. It's possible that this was intended to be campy and over the top but it comes across as just plain awful. It could have been saved if the script had been better. Unfortunately, it's one of those things that is so bad that you can't help but laugh at it.

I have read the book and to me it makes a lot more sense than the movie version.

I'm surprised that anyone really likes this movie. I don't know why, but I would suggest that you rent the movie, watch it, and then put it on the shelf and never look back.

 To be frank, I was expecting a lot more from this movie. It's not a bad movie at all, but it's not quite as good as it could have been. I've been watching a lot of low-budget horror movies lately, and there's actually a lot of good material in here, but it's just not well-developed. There are a lot of issues that could have been explored, but it wasn't. There are a lot of questions that the movie just doesn't answer. I think the movie could have been much better if it had taken the time to develop its characters more. The character of "The Cougar" could have been given much more time to develop, and the movie could have made a lot more sense if the movie had explored this character more. I felt like the movie was very plot-driven when it should have been character-driven. That's not to say that the plot is uninteresting, but it would have been nice to have more character development in the movie.

I also felt that there were some weak plot points in the movie. The "big twist" that occurs at the end of the movie is actually very weak. I'd have to say that the movie is worth
 Let's get this straight, I thought this movie was not very good. It was more of a comedy than a film. One thing I did appreciate was the acting of Jack Black, who was great in it. The movie was not scary which is a huge plus for me. The ending was not what I expected but I guess that's okay. The whole about the ring was so dumb, I mean other movies have been made about the meaning of the ring, but not like this. It was kind of like a bad "High School Musical" with the whole love story. I guess if you are into that kind of movie, this is for you. In my opinion this movie is not worth your time and money. I can see why it was nominated for the Oscars. I'm not saying this movie was bad, but it's pretty average. I would not recommend it to people who are looking for a scary movie or something to watch with their kids. If you want to see a bad "High School Musical" this is the movie for you. I know it's hard to believe, but I did enjoy this movie.

 I'm not sure if I can make sense of this movie but I can say that it was the first movie I've ever watched in which I felt like I was watching an actual amateur movie. I've seen some bad amateur movies, but this one was different. Since it was the first, I couldn't tell what the movie was about but it didn't matter. I was happy that I didn't have to wait for the whole movie to be over, but I was very, very disappointed in the story. The characters, the acting, the dialogue, the script--everything was terrible, and I'm sorry I wasted my time on this movie.

I can't even say why I was really interested in watching this movie. I don't even remember what I was expecting. I was hoping it would be a good movie, but it wasn't. I felt like I was watching a cheap, uninteresting movie.

I'm sorry I wasted my time on reviewing this movie. I'm sorry I wasted my money on buying this movie. I'm sorry I wasted my time and energy on writing this review. I'm sorry.

The movie was about a man, who is the son of a wealthy family, who discovers
 I've seen a lot of bad movies. This one was just plain awful. The acting was atrocious, the plot was unoriginal, and the editing was horrible. I also feel that a love story needs to be believable for it to be a true romantic story. This movie had several plot holes that could have easily been fixed. I remember thinking, "What the heck is this all about?" The movie was just so confusing that I had to look up some of the actors' names to see if I had seen them in other things. I did, but this movie just didn't fit in with them. I was hoping I was wrong, but I wasn't. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it was short. I wish it had been longer.

I haven't seen this many reviews on any other movie, but this movie seems to have gotten a lot of attention. I think I am the only person who has actually watched the whole thing. I knew nothing about it, but I decided to watch it anyway. What a mistake that was for me. First, the acting was horrible. The actors could barely
 This movie is supposed to be a comedy. It seems to me that the writer/director was confused, which is the reason why he took a comedy and gave it a serious tone. The movie was pretty bad. There were some funny scenes, but nothing too funny about this movie. i don't recommend it to anybody.

7/10

***SPOILERS***

<br /><br />The first half of the movie consists of all the lead characters attempting to survive out in the desert. Some get killed, others get captured. The movie eventually ends with the characters, who are still alive, at the end of the road, with a church in the background, as though to say that these characters will finally be saved by something good. I don't see this film as a comedy. I see it as a serious drama. <br /><br />I don't think that Hollywood should be allowed to do this. It's cruel to the audience, who will pay money to see a comedy, only to be subjected to a drama. <br /><br />The characters are so boring, they're not even funny. Of course, they're not supposed to be funny, but they aren't funny
 I have to agree with the previous reviewer. The best parts of "The Legend of Hell House" are the sections that are made up of the reviews by the members of the Society for Psychical Research. This allows the story to become more about the participants than the plot itself.<br /><br />The plot is that a book of satanic rites is discovered. The book is sold to the highest bidder who will have to solve the riddles to read the book. The plot is weak and the writing style is awful. The plot is also confusing. The characters are not well developed and the entire story is quite boring. There was no suspense or awareness of danger. The plot is actually quite stupid.<br /><br />The movie is not terrible. The actors are good, but I did not enjoy the movie at all. I was bored and did not care about any of the characters. The movie is not in the style of a horror movie. It is more of a psychological and social commentary. <br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie and get a good laugh or cry. The movie is very entertaining and enjoyable. The audience is not expected to give a great deal of thought to
 I've only seen this movie once, when it aired on TV, and I found it was not only poorly acted, but poorly directed, and poorly written. It is a movie that tries to be sophisticated and intellectual, but fails miserably. It's a movie that tries to be "artsy," but is actually silly. It's a movie that tries to be profound, but is so simplistic and shallow that it comes off as silly. It's a movie that tries to be profound, but is so stupid and not thought out that it's painful to watch.<br /><br /><br /><br />The acting is so poor, that it's painful to watch. The story is so stupid, that it's painful to watch. The ideas are so simplistic, that they're painful to watch. The setting is so poorly conceived, that it's painful to watch.<br /><br />I realize that this movie is not for everyone, but I do think it should be viewed by anyone who has ever had a sincere interest in movies. It is not a movie I would want to watch again, and I haven't any desire to watch it again. The writing is so simplistic (and so poorly written), that it's
 This was the final film in the series as far as I know, and it didn't live up to the previous films. The first film was good and this was not. The story, which was very loosely based on the first book in the series, was slow and predictable, and nothing could save it. I disagree with the previous comment that it was better than the first, because the first didn't have a lot of action. This one had very little to begin with, and that's why it seemed to fast-forward through the talk between the characters and the introductions of the new characters, which were pointless. The only things that saved this film were the actors, who were all very good.

I give it a 6/10

The film's a classic, but the book is superior.

 This is a decent movie that tells the story of the mother of one of the 9-11 terrorists. <br /><br />The movie is well done and the actors are believable. My problem is with the situation the family is in. It doesn't make sense that the mother would be so happy that her son would be killed. It's not like he was a real threat to the rest of the family. He was already in Guantanamo for god's sake. It's just not believable that a mom would be so happy that her son was going to be killed. The movie should have been "pride in the name of terrorism" instead of "pride in the name of the family."

<br /><br />The other problem is that it doesn't make sense that a family member would be so happy that the family business was destroyed. The whole thing was in the news and the family business was destroyed. The family should be ashamed of the business and the fact that their son was a terrorist and not be so happy about the business being destroyed.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent movie and I think anybody who likes the story of the 9-11 terrorists would like to see it.


 This movie was so boring you could not stay awake. I was embarrassed to watch it with my friends. The only thing good about this movie was the fact that it was short. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

 This was a terrible film. It was so bad that we had to watch it twice. The one good thing about it is that it didn't try to make any of the characters sympathetic or likable, so you don't have to feel bad about it when the movie gets you. The movie was just terrible. I was never able to figure out why the main character would even want to be a cop. He was a complete jerk, and didn't even seem to care about his kid. He was so full of himself, and acted as if he was better than everybody else. The other characters were just as bad, and I don't even want to talk about them. The only good thing about this movie is that it was short, so I don't have to feel bad about wasting my time.

 A nice idea for a movie, but it doesn't translate well. The script is not very good, and the acting is not very good. The cinematography is well done, and the music is very good. The idea of a black woman being the only one who can have a child, and eventually have a child that looks like a white child, is a good idea. But the movie makes it look like the black woman is the one who is making the child look like the white child. In reality, it is the white man. The movie could have been much better.

I love the fact that they make movies that deal with sensitive issues, and they don't make it seem like the whole world is going to end. It's not like most movies today that pretend to be about something important, but it's all a lie. This movie is about a very important issue, and they made it look like it wasn't. I love movies that deal with sensitive issues,
 I never saw the original. I thought it was a remake. The trailer on the DVD made it look like it was a remake, but it's not. It's a sequel. I read the book once, and I think the movie did a decent job of the book, but it was just OK. The music was annoying and the acting was always off. The pacing was really slow. There was a lot of unnecessary sex scenes in the movie and it was too long. The movie was just OK. It was nothing special. In fact, it was really boring. I didn't really like the ending. The acting was good, but the script was weak. The directing was OK, but it was just OK. I was expecting a lot more from the movie. It wasn't a good movie, but it was nothing terrible. I was expecting a lot more. I was expecting the book to be better. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special.

 This movie is a mess. A bad, bad mess. I was so bored I was imagining SNL-like sketches involving the cast and maybe some of the extras.<br /><br />The plot is a horrible combination of 1980s action movie and 1980s slasher movie. The action is so bad and so over the top that it's hard to take it seriously. The slasher elements are incredibly weak, and seem to be more of a stylistic choice than anything else.<br /><br />"The Boy Who Cried Werewolf" is one of those movies that I feel is so bad that it's good, and you can't help but laugh at the badness of it. You can't help but laugh at how bad the acting is, how bad the effects are, how bad the story is. The movie is a weird mix between "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and "My Bloody Valentine", but with the horror elements taken out. I think it would be better to say that it's a parody of the horror genre. It's a parody that's so bad, it's good. It's a parody that's so bad, it's good.

I think the acting is the biggest problem with
 I'm not sure what the original version of this film was like, as I've only seen the DVD release. The DVD version lacks any extras whatsoever, and is a very cheap production. I will probably not watch this film again. As a film fan, I am very disappointed that this film is getting a DVD release. For a $30.00 purchase, I feel like I've been ripped off.<br /><br />The film is not a good one. The film is not even a good bad film. It is just a pointless, stupid, pointless film. It tries to be a film about revenge, but the film is so bad, that it does not make any sense. I would probably not even bother rating this film as a 1, because it has no redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The DVD release is probably better than the original IMDb rating of 2.5, but that is only because I have a DVD player. If you're not a film fan, you might want to skip this film.

I, too, saw the film
 I have to give it to the actor, who plays the evil villain in this movie, he did a great job. His performance was the only thing that kept this movie from being a complete waste of time. I'm not saying it was an amazing performance, but he was better than a lot of the other actors in this movie. The rest of the movie was terrible. It was bad to the point where I was actually hoping for it to end, so I could get out of there and never have to watch it again. I kept thinking, "I wonder how much the movie costs to make?" This movie was a complete waste of my time. I'm sure the filmmakers made a ton of money off of this movie (I'm not saying that it was really a crap movie, just saying that good actors can make a bad movie good, and bad actors can make a good movie bad.)

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not saying that it was an excellent movie, but the actors did a good job. This movie was so bad that it makes me wonder if it was really made by a real movie studio, or
 This is one of the most ludicrous pieces of donkey work I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. The characters, the plot, the dialogue, the acting, the sets, the costumes, the direction, the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack, the lighting, the lighting technicians, the script, the editor, the cast, the production crew, the script supervisor, the director. EVERYTHING! I am speechless. The only thing that saved this movie from total disaster was the jaw-dropping incompetence of the producers who gave this pile of sh*t a budget. I heard it was supposed to be a comedy. Why is one of the funniest comedians in Hollywood writing, directing and producing such a bad movie? This is like a comedy version of "Citizen Kane" with a cast of mentally challenged extras.

<br /><br />The plot is so convoluted that I couldn't even begin to follow it. I know it's been said many times that the plot is completely irrelevant to the movie itself, that it's just window dressing. Well, I don't agree. The plot is integral to the movie, and if I didn't know anything about the plot I wouldn't have even come close to guessing at
 I was a huge fan of this show. I was a child during this time frame in history and the show was so captivating I couldn't stop watching. Then tonight I watched it and I realized the main reason I hadn't watched it in a while was because I had no idea what was going on. I mean, what was that thing that would come out of the water and take the men away? I have no idea. The other thing that really bugs me is that there are several factual errors in the show, but I'm willing to let that slide since the show is so gripping to watch. But one thing I can't let slide, is the acting. I mean, it's hard enough to believe that some of these people are real, but it's even harder to believe that these actors can act with all these things going on. Even the cover girl, who is supposed to be a homely, no-good woman, is acting with such emotion, I'm expecting her to break down any moment. I don't know if it's because I'm being so critical of the show, or if I just don't like the acting. But either way I just don't have much respect for this show now.


 I was expecting the worst from this movie...but was pleasantly surprised. It was very entertaining in a stupid sort of way. I thought it would be a poorly made and over-hyped movie, but it wasn't. I like the fact that the movie didn't take itself too seriously. The actors all did an exceptional job, even though I don't think any of them were in the movie for very long. I think the movie was actually pretty funny and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a(nother) funny movie.

8/10

The movie was pretty good, even though it left me a little unsatisfied. It was a little out there and the characters didn't really get what they wanted. The movie was more of a comedy, but it still left the audience with a little bit of a depressing ending.

 This movie was so, so bad it was painful. I know it's a comedy, but it is so painfully, painfully bad. I felt sorry for the actors trying to make this movie as funny as they possibly could, but it just wasn't funny. I had high hopes for this movie, but was completely let down. The only reason I'm giving it a two is because it did make me laugh at times. I would say to anyone who is interested in watching it, don't do it. It's just not worth it.

In my opinion, the best movie of that caliber was the Hot Tub Time Machine. This movie, this movie sucks. It sucks so bad.

 The entire movie is a joke. The movie starts with a very bad and bad acting by the lead actor and actor of the movie, i could not understand what the film was about and i couldn't for the first 15 minutes. Then we find out about the movie with a very bad and bad acting by the director. I think he was more interested in making a movie than making it good, because of this my question is if he can even make a movie not just a bad one. The movie is just bad and bad, it is nothing more than a bad joke, it is just so bad it is funny. The only thing that is good is the originality of the film, the idea of making a movie about the holocaust, is something that is near impossible to do. So i think the film made it as close to the truth as i could imagine. But a bad and bad movie that still is funny, you have to see it to believe it, i give it 3 out of 10.

 I watched this movie with my husband, and he was a little surprised by the ending. The thing that made the movie so good was that it was so real. For the first time I knew what it was like to be at a party in high school and be so embarrassed by some of the things that your classmates do. I remember being embarrassed of my friends who wore fake hair and things like that, but this movie showed that there are other people out there who are just as embarrassed as you are. I feel bad for the kids who have to go through that, and it makes me a little angry that some people have to go through that.

I am going to say that the actors did a good job, even though the acting was not the best, the story was great and I would say that I was very impressed. I was very happy when I saw the movie and can't wait to see the sequel. I think that this movie is good for high school kids who are going through the same thing, or people who just want to see the real story of a high school party. I would say that this movie is suitable for all ages, but I think younger kids (tweeners) would really enjoy it.


 This film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is absolutely terrible, and the special effects are laughable at best. The director has no clue as to what is going on. The plot is very confusing, and I couldn't follow it the whole time I was watching it. It is the kind of film that you have to see to believe. It is a complete waste of time, and a huge waste of money. I can't believe that this film was released in theaters. I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this one tops them all. I have never seen a film that was so bad that I couldn't believe it was actually made. I have watched this movie about 20 times and I still can't figure out what is going on, and I'm not even sure I want to. The film is so bad that you have to see it to believe it. The only good thing about this movie is that it's a short film, so you don't have to sit through it for very long. My advice is to stay away from this film. The only good thing about this film is that it's a short film, so you don't have to sit through it for very long. My advice
 I just saw this movie and I have to say that I am so angry I didn't read the book first. I'm not a Dickens fan, in fact, I think I've only read 1 of his books and it was so bad I didn't enjoy it, but this movie was even worse than I thought it would be. The names were changed to protect the innocent, but the story was just awful. I can't believe how bad it was. I just read the book and I thought it was good. I hope The one with gustave says a word about this movie. I guess it doesn't count if it's a work of fiction.

It is a shame, as the actors acted well and I've heard good things about the author. Maybe I read the wrong book. Maybe the movie doesn't match the book. Maybe the movie is just flat out different. Maybe I should have just read the book. But I'm glad I didn't. The movie wasn't even funny. It was depressing. I can't believe that I wasted my time watching this. It was so bad.

In the book, Charles Darnay's former master is killed and he is forced to flee England. He is being
 "Escape From Planet Earth" is a very bad movie. It is an awful excuse for a comedy, with a very boring story, a bad script and characters that are so unbelievable that they are not worth mentioning. The character of the child (who is the main character of the movie) is not only incomprehensible, but also annoying. The movie also has a very unconvincing story with a very poor script and a very confusing ending. This movie is a huge waste of time. I would definitely not recommend it.

**spoiler alert** The movie starts with a very boring story about a kid named Jay (played by Chris O'Donnell) who has a fantastic imagination. He lives in an apartment in the city and his dad is a surgeon. His mom (Annette Benning) is a scientist and his sister is a doctor. He has these imaginary friends whom he always talks about. One day his mom comes home and tells him he must move to a new apartment because her new apartment is much bigger than the old one. They move to the new apartment and when they arrive there, they get a big surprise. On the inside of the apartment there are all kinds of robots, computers,
 I am a huge fan of the first two movies, and I am not sure if it was just the fact that the first two were so much better, or if it was the fact that I knew what I was getting into that makes this one so lackluster. <br /><br />First off, the movie follows the original movie pretty closely. The character of Killian Scott is still the same, and the story line is still the same. However, the acting and the script is a complete turn off. The first two movies were filled with cheesy, over the top, and campy acting, but here the acting is just plain bad, and most of the characters are just not very interesting. There is a scene where Alex (the little sister) is crying, and it is real bad, and it's obviously staged, but it doesn't add anything to the story. I agree with the other reviewers, the music is pretty annoying, and the main score is really bad. There are a lot of scenes with slow motion, and weird camera angles, and it just doesn't add anything to the movie. <br /><br />I also disagree with the other reviewers that this movie is better than the original. The original is still
 I know that this movie is a cheap rip-off of the "Dirty Harry" movies, but it's still absolutely horrible. Even if you like "Dirty Harry" movies, this is a bad one. It is not funny, the car chase is awful, and the acting is atrocious. They should have done a better job on it. I would say to rent "Dirty Harry" instead of this.

 This is the best worst movie I have ever seen. I feel like I'm in one of those episodes of South Park where they make a really bad movie with really good actors and it's really funny. This movie was so bad it's actually good. The acting was bad, the script was bad, the sets were bad, the movie was just bad. So bad it's good.<br /><br />All the actors in it are really good. I particularly enjoyed the "star", the one who is in it all the time. He is the worst actor I have ever seen. The guy who played the best friend is pretty good. But the rest of the actors in this movie are just hopeless. I was laughing out loud when I watched it. I'm not kidding. The movie is so bad it's actually good.

Worst movie ever

This is the worst movie ever. the acting was terrible, the script was terrible, the sets were terrible, the locations were terrible. the only thing that was good
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am a movie fanatic. I was looking for a good movie to watch on the weekend and I came across this one which I had never heard of. The concept of the movie was great and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately I was proved wrong.<br /><br />The acting was mediocre and the script was poor. The storyline was unrealistic and the cinematography was almost non-existent. The movie was long and drawn out and it gave me a headache. I have seen better movies such as "Evolution" and "The Island".<br /><br />Overall, the movie was a complete waste of time and I would not recommend this to anyone. It is definitely not worth the money you would pay to view it.

 I picked this movie up on a whim and was really surprised to find it to be such a horrible piece of crap. This is the most trashy film I've ever seen and I have a certain degree of tolerance for trash, but this was really, really bad. The acting is terrible, the plot is completely derivative of other films (the best example being the opening scene in which the main character is attacked), and the costumes are, frankly, ridiculous. There are several "wacky" musical numbers, and one of the supporting characters is a man who sings about how he's not gay but has a "lady friend." It's all very unfunny, and the movie's only saving grace was a surprising amount of nudity. I enjoyed the performances by the two girls who were nude and I even laughed at the "fake" sex scene (because it was so obviously fake). To make matters worse, the DVD I saw was in Italian and the language and subtitles were awful, but I think the DVD I have is the original version. Apparently, this movie was a huge hit in Italy. I found out later that the English one was released in the U.S. under a different title. I still can't figure out why.
 First off, the title isn't very creative, the movie's title is God's Warrior. The movie is about a warrior god that was born of a virgin mother, who is raised by the Devil and becomes a warrior of his own. He's sent by the devil to kill the warrior god and overthrow him. The movie's also about the fight between good and evil, with a little bit of love thrown in. The movie's not very good, with a lot of special effects and some really corny dialogue. There's really not much to it, and it's a very long movie. I suggest renting it, unless you're a really big fan of the director.<br /><br />Kratos is a good actor who can play a tough guy, but he's not very good as a fighter. He's a good actor, but he's not an all-around actor. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars.

 This movie is awful. It's not the acting, it's not the lack of money, it's not even the editing. What's wrong is that it doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense that a group of friends go to the movies and get stuck with some random guy in a movie, it doesn't make sense that they go to a movie theater, it doesn't make sense that they are trying to figure out where their friends are, it doesn't make sense that they got stuck in an elevator, it doesn't make sense that the guy is talking to a plant. It's a mess. The acting is pretty bad, though Annette Benning is pretty cute. I'm not sure why she was in this movie, she could have been in a better movie. She could have been in "Gone in 60 Seconds" with Nicolas Cage. But then again, he's been in a lot worse flicks. So I guess if you're a fan of Annette Benning, go see it. Otherwise, I wouldn't watch it.

 The first two-thirds of this film are extremely well done. The acting, the directing, the cinematography, and the script are all top-notch. But the third-quarter of the movie is almost entirely different, and the direction of the film is so-so at best. There are so many plot threads that run throughout the film that it's hard to keep track of them, but some of them include: the suicide-murder of a young woman; the death of a drug dealer; a 12-year-old boy who becomes a drug dealer; the capture of a female drug dealer by the police; the capture of a large shipment of drugs by the police; another man who is a drug dealer; and three other men who are drug dealers. There are also various side-plots, such as the romance between the film's two main stars and the problems between them, the romance between the film's two main stars and his girlfriend, the romance between the film's main character and the girlfriend of his father's killer, the romance between the film's main character and the 12-year-old boy who becomes a drug dealer, the romance between the film's main character and his girlfriend's father's killer,
 I had high hopes for this movie, but was surprised at how bad it was. The acting was terrible, the plot was unbelievable, and the characters were uninteresting. There were a few good scenes, but the bad outweighed the good. I give this movie a 3 out of 10.

I recommend this movie only to people who enjoy comedy.

I watched this movie in the theater, and it was worth the money, but it was not a good movie.

I've never seen the movie, but did read a lot of the reviews. I was expecting it to be rotten, and it was. I didn't see any of the good things people have said in the other reviews. Also, I am in the middle of another movie that
 In a dark, cold and uninviting lab, scientists conduct experiments on animals. The animals are in cages, which are held upright by wooden poles. Not a pleasant environment for the animals. The experiments are performed on them, in an attempt to find a cure for the deadly virus which is known as the "Million-Dollar-A-Head" virus. The virus does not affect humans, but when one of the researchers dies, the rest are infected. As the virus spreads, the scientists try to find a cure, but in the process, they have to find a cure for the virus. The virus spreads to the animals' eyes, which somehow propagate the virus. So, in a horrific manner, the animals become infected as well. But when a human researcher dies, the human researcher is able to find a cure.<br /><br />The film is slow, tedious and just not enjoyable. The story is not predictable, and the ending is not a happy one. If the viewer has an interest in the virus and the scientific experiments, then the film is worth watching. Otherwise, pass.

<br /><br />This film was originally released in Germany and was known as "The Return of Doctor Cal
 As a fan of both John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, I was impressed to learn that Carpenter was making a new film about the former, and I expected the film to be a true labour of love. I was completely wrong, as this is a mess of a film that was made by a filmmaker who doesn't give a damn about his audience. I understand that the subject matter and situation was very difficult to portray, but Carpenter's film is no more than a slight improvement on the average TV movie. The film is centred around a man (Russell) who is accused of killing his wife, and the story picks up when he is on the run. Russell is a great actor, and he carries the film with aplomb, but he can't save the film from being a dud. I still think John Carpenter is a great director, but he seems to be in danger of losing his touch.

 I liked this movie for the most part. Some parts were funny. But the movie did a number on me. I am a die-hard Fonzie fan and I am a big fan of the show Happy Days. If it weren't for these two things, I would not of bothered to watch this movie. The movie seemed to drag on and on. I found myself falling asleep at times. I don't know if it was the acting or the direction. Perhaps it was a combination of both. I will not go into too much detail as most other people have already gone into detail. If you are a fan of Happy Days or Fonzie or both, then you may enjoy the movie. But if you are not, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

Please note that I am not being paid to write this review. I just happened to have seen this film and thought it was worth mentioning. I have no connection to this film at all.

I did not find any errors in the review above.

 The first thing that struck me about this movie was the huge difference in the quality of the acting. The "stars" were awful. The only good actor was a woman who played the mother (I don't know her name). She was a very decent actress and I remember thinking that she did a good job. The rest of the actors were extremely bad. I found myself wondering why they were all in the movie. Also, the direction was very amateurish. I am no expert but it looked as if someone just taped a bunch of shots to a board without any editing. The music was about as bad as the acting and the story was extremely ridiculous. The grandmother of the family, played by the mom, has a new husband that comes to town. The new husband has a son from his previous marriage who has a crush on the daughter. The daughter falls for the son thinking he is in love with her. Of course, she finds out that he is only after her money. The story doesn't get any better from there. I didn't stay to see how things turned out.

After seeing the previews, I was expecting a good movie. In reality, it was very disappointing.

 I laughed at this movie. I have no idea why anyone would think it was funny. Anyone who likes this movie is either stupid or has a serious mental illness. There is not a single person in this entire movie who either has a sense of humor or can act. They should just go directly to hell. I was stunned at how unfunny this movie actually was. I laughed at the goofier parts of "Hot Shots", but this is right up there with "Spaceballs", "Spaceballs 2", and "Spaceballs 3". It's horrible. The guys who wrote this should be shot. They're losers. No one should ever watch this movie, and no one should ever show this movie to anybody else. The only reason I even watched this was because I was given a VHS copy of it from another person who probably had no idea what it was or how bad it was. After watching this horrible film, I can confirm that everyone else who has given this movie a good review is a complete idiot. This movie is a joke, and you must be stupid to like it. I hope that idiots like you who actually like this movie will be ashamed at the end when you die. Just remember that this movie is the worst thing
 I have never seen a movie so cheesy and boring as this. I was expecting at least a little action, but was disappointed.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good film to watch, I can recommend this one only with one condition: Don't expect any action and don't expect any plot either.<br /><br />The movie is not about football, but about a nutcase who wants to kill everybody.<br /><br />There is no action, no plot, nothing. It's just an exercise in bad acting.

It's a real shame, because I am a fan of the sport, and I thought that there would be something good in the film. I was extremely disappointed.

More movies like this I would appreciate.

Diary of the Dead (2007) review



This movie is so bad that you have to ask yourself if it was done on purpose.<br /><br />I am not a fan of zombie movies, but I was looking forward to this movie.
 I was expecting a great film; a film about a group of rebels, fighting for the freedom of their country, for the control of the land, for the dignity of their people. I did not get what I am saying; I got a film about a group of rebels, fighting for the freedom of their country, for the control of their land and for the dignity of their people. A film about a group of rebels, fighting for the freedom of their country, for the control of their land, for the dignity of their people; in the end of the film, they all end up dead, or they are captured or they go back to their homes. I thought that the film was going to be about a group of rebels, fighting for the freedom of their country, for the control of their land, for the dignity of their people; but in the end of the film, they all ended up dead, or they are captured or they go back to their homes. I thought that the film was going to be about a group of rebels, fighting for the freedom of their country, for the control of their land, for the dignity of their people; but in the end of the film, they all ended up dead, or they are
 Finally, a movie about a dysfunctional family that is both funny and heartwarming. This is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. The cast is wonderful, as is the script. The scene in which the kids run around the house looking for their mother is classic. The plot is lighthearted and the dialogue is very funny. The only problem is that the movie is too short. They could have added a few more scenes and given the movie a bit more punch. But it's still a good movie.

The Extra Man (1994) Superb! 9 November 2000 - 1 out of 2 users found this review helpful. "The Extra Man" is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is witty, charming and very amusing. The movie is about a man who is trying to find the love of his life. He meets three women who each feel the same way about him, but don't know it. The women are played by Ellen DeGeneres, Jennifer Tilly
 I was a wee bit disappointed with the quality of this movie. The plot was a bit thin, and a lot of the dialog felt like it was taken out of a late night infomercial. The acting was very amateurish, and the dialog wasn't exactly the greatest either. The movie just felt like a bit of a waste of time.

The movie did, however, have a few good points. I like the fact that it was mostly a "guy" movie, which is a little rare in the world of movies. I would still recommend this movie to other people, because I think it's worth a rental.

 I hadn't been planning on watching this movie until I saw the trailer. It looked like a mildly entertaining movie with some funny moments, so I figured I would give it a shot...<br /><br />I mean, come on, it's Charlie Sheen, right? It's got to be better than something with Ashton Kutcher or Gwyneth Paltrow. The movie's title says it all, "wag the dog", and that's exactly what it is...a whole bunch of jokes about Bill to make you laugh, but that's about it.<br /><br />The best joke in the movie is the one where Bill goes to war and the camera tracks along with him, zoomed in on his crotch. That's pretty funny, but the rest of the movie is just a series of "ooh, look at the funny thing, watch what Charlie does, laugh a little..." kind of moments. They get old really fast, and if you watched the trailer, you'll see that there are a couple of scenes in the movie that were NOT in the trailer. <br /><br />I think it's pretty low budget (I don't expect much from Charlie Sheen, but still...) and there
 I didn't realize this movie was a remake of the 1976 film "Slumber Party Massacre" until after I saw it. While I was still watching it, I was thinking, "Hey, this isn't bad." But as soon as it ended, I realized I was wrong. I mean, it is a bad movie. Not just one with a bad script, but a bad movie. It's not even a good slasher film, not like the original that I had seen years before. This is one of those B-grade horror films that you see on late night TV and wonder, "How the hell did they get away with that?"<br /><br />The story involves four sisters (Kirsten, Elizabeth, Brittany and Rachel), one of whom is a lesbian, who are staying at a mansion with their mother and stepfather. The girls decide to go to a slumber party. Their stepfather is a rich and creepy guy who likes to play a game called "Hide and Seek", where he'll hide, but the girls can't see him. The slumber party turns out to be a bad, bad idea. While the girls are having their slumber party, the stepfather is trying to kill them
 The film itself is a bit flat and dull, but not the fault of the actors. The script is weak, it's hard for me to even grasp what is going on. The film just feels flat, like underground water. The special effects are mediocre, but the film is not totally lacking in them. The main problem is that the film is just too slow. It's not until the very end you realize how much time has passed since the film began. The film has decent cinematography and camera work, but not great. The film is fairly short, but it's the pacing that is the problem. The film has a lot of wasted opportunities to be more interesting than it is. The film has some truly funny moments (one of the "goons" gets hit by an arrow and is on fire, another gets hit by a big rock and falls from a cliff-side), but the film is not funny. The film is not as poorly acted as some reviews have made it out to be. There are some really good performances in the film, it's just the film's slow pace makes it impossible to really get into the performances. The film is pretty much a one-joke movie, but it's a good joke.
 I saw this movie back in January and found it very disappointing. It starts off well enough with a good plot, but then it drags out boring and repetitive. There's not much in the way of special effects, and the movie is pretty much all dialogue, which can be very tedious to listen to, especially all the time. The movie is supposed to be about a new evil force, but all it does is cause the young boy to lose his girlfriend, although the way they go about it is to a rather non-suspicious extent. It tries to get a little more interesting at the end, but it was too little, too late. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

7/10

P.S. I know this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it's not funny at all.

P.P.S. For some reason, I find it funny that the evil (???) force has a name beginning with "M", like "M-Force", or "M-5", or something.

P.P.P.S. The title of the movie is "Mummy" spelled backwards, which is funny and even more so because I've seen
 As a movie, this is a bore. As a documentary, it's a bore, but this is a documentary. The use of the 'talking heads' format (with the exception of one of the cameramen, who may or may not have been paid to be there) is a great way for the viewer to get to know the people that are interviewed, and for the viewer to get to know the subject matter. I had to turn this one off because I didn't want to see anyone else be interviewed. It doesn't matter if you're a documentary fan or not, the whole thing is tedious. I'd of course give it a miss.

 I really didn't like this movie. It was boring. And I felt like I was watching a Lifetime movie or something. I was watching it because I was curious, but as an adult, I just couldn't get into it. I wish they had just left it as a TV movie. I'm not sure why they made this into a movie, since it doesn't have the same impact as a movie.

There was a lot of the story line that I didn't really understand. I felt like I was missing something. And I don't just say that because I don't understand how to use a computer. I know how to use a computer, and I just don't understand how this movie could be confused with this story. I think that if I had been clued in on all the details, I would have loved this movie. But I just don't understand how this movie could be confused with the story. It was very confusing.

Another thing that I didn't like about this movie was that the whole story line is about the computer, and it was never explained how the computer works. I don't know how they could have missed that detail. Unless they were just trying to make it seem less like a
 I used to be a big fan of the movie "Mystery Men". In fact, it was the first comedy movie I ever saw in the theater. I've seen it several times since then. I've seen it so many times I probably watch it once a year at least. I was very excited when I saw this movie. I thought that it would be the same kind of movie that Mystery Men was. It was not. Mystery Men was a movie that you could watch over and over again; this movie is not. I feel it was a wasted opportunity. There were so many things that could have been done with this movie, but they just didn't. I felt like I was watching the same movie over and over again. The movie was not as funny as Mystery Men. The jokes were not as good. The characters were not as likable. You'll see what I mean once you watch the movie. I give the movie 2 out of 10.

 I just can't believe this movie ever got made. I could not tell what the point was of this movie. I guess the only redeeming value was the facial hair of the main character. If a person was to judge this movie purely on the acting, i.e. the two leading men, then it would get a 1/10. But why did this movie need to be made? I am a huge fan of the original and I was really looking forward to watching this. This is why I usually give a movie a pass and just enjoy the plot, characters and dialog. But, no, I have to judge the plot, dialog and characters of this movie against the original and this movie fails miserably. I am a big fan of the original, and the idea of Mad Max and all the plot changes, this movie disappoints. I understand the plot was changed and it is a different take on the story, but the plot seemed as if it was written by a 12 year old. I am not sure what the story was supposed to be, but I think the idea was to have the most popular movie of all time and make a new version, but this movie is not only a bad movie, it is a poor attempt
 I was expecting a little bit more in this movie. The first thing is the setting. The school's in the middle of nowhere. It looks like a real school, but it's really a film studio set. That's not a problem, but when you don't see any actual teachers for most of the time, it's a little bit boring.<br /><br />Next is the acting. I have to admit, I couldn't understand most of the time why the kids were doing what they were doing. Some of them were even speaking the same lines over and over again.<br /><br />Finally the story line. For example the main character kills a guy who killed his friend. The guy who killed his friend was a bad guy, but the main character didn't know it. At the beginning of the movie the main character said in front of the principal that he did it because he had to. I mean, we don't see any of that. He just kills the guy and goes home. Nothing happens to him. He doesn't get in trouble, nothing. It's just like it never happened. I mean, it's a good movie, but it's not a good thriller.

 This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Why? I don't know. I guess it was just a bad day. The plot is terrible, the acting is horrible, and the character development is non-existent. The director seems to want to do a "horror" film, but the whole thing is just a slow, boring, and really boring film. There is a lot of blood and gore in this film, but that doesn't make it a good film. In fact, the only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was only 85 minutes long. So I guess that's a good thing.

 When a film is as bad as this one is, it's hard to find anything good to say about it. I had to sleep last night with the TV on to get to sleep. What a waste of time and money. I've seen some bad movies, but this one stands out as the worst film I've ever seen. I would give this movie an "F" if only the rating system allowed me to do so. <br /><br />The "acting" was horrendous. The story line was so confusing I had to ask my wife if she took any of the pills that the characters took. The characters were completely unbelievable. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. I nearly fell asleep during the movie. I do not understand why this film has even been released. It's not even worth renting. Just avoid this one at all costs.

 In this movie, the good guys are the bad guys, and the bad guys are the heroes. The good guys are the ones who are always doing the wrong thing, whether it's shooting up schools or blowing up people. The bad guys are the ones who are always trying to save the day and make the world a better place. It's not a bad message to be teaching, but the movie is terribly written, acted and directed; the message is too simplistic. Oh, this is a tragedy, but the hero is too much of a good guy. All the good guys in the movie are always the ones who are doing the wrong thing, which is not very realistic. The hero is always the one who is decent and in the right, but he doesn't know that his own best friend is a villain who is out to get him. The bad guys are never given a chance to explain themselves, and when they do, the hero doesn't believe them. This is a very anti-American movie. I am very anti-American, but this movie just doesn't work for me.

 I was rather surprised to see that this movie is well-regarded. I'm not sure what I saw that was so great about it. It was really boring. I was really surprised when I saw a "10" rating.

What were the reviewers thinking? The plot doesn't make any sense. Why would the writer of a script with a seemingly realistic plot (the story of a girl who wants to be a boy) make the story so absurd that it can't even be taken seriously?

The movie was a complete waste of time. It is not funny, it is not interesting, and it is not believable. I don't know how the reviewers can give it a 10/10. I know that I wouldn't have wanted to sit through it.

 This movie is a waste of time. The premise is good, but the execution is terrible. This movie is the ultimate in the "been there, done that" genre. The movie is a complete mess.

The synopsis of the movie is this: Visiting sci-fi writer, Michael Hordern, is invited to the island of Lindera to do a book tour. The island is the home of the Lindera people. The main character, Michael, is shot at by a sniper, is attacked by a crazed woman in a white dress and then is kidnapped. He is forced to do things that he doesn't want to do.

 This movie is a real stinker. Three college students go on a trip to a lake on the edge of the Sahara desert. They find themselves being stalked by a mysterious figure and eventually get picked up by a truck driver. He turns out to be a former British secret agent and is going to kill the kids so he can go back in time to kill the bad guy. It's a very silly, silly movie that doesn't work at all. The acting is stilted and wooden. The plot is so thin it's practically non-existent. The cinematography is pretty bad. The music is about as exciting as elevator music. The director is so determined to create some kind of a mystery that he ends up introducing lead characters that are so thinly disguised that you can see through them. The actors are quite good with the exception of the lead female who had the most difficult role to play. She is a very good actress but she just doesn't seem to fit in this movie. The lead male, who is supposed to be a good character, doesn't seem to be at all. The special effects are cheesy and that's all you need to know about them. The movie is really bad. Avoid it.

 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and I have seen some truly awful ones. The acting was amateurish, the plot was lame and the pace was slow. In short, this was a bad movie. The only reason I watched it was because I was curious to know how Statham and McQueen were going to take the lead roles - and, unfortunately, they do not do much to interest me. The only reason I gave it only one star is because I didn't bother to change it.

The film makes the mistake of trying to be a serious film and fall into the same trap that made The Godfather and Chinatown such disasters. <br /><br />The film tries to be serious, but the plot is so weak, it's laughable.

 As someone who loves the original Star Trek TV series and the movies, the premise of this movie really appealed to me. The first few scenes were really interesting, and I was really looking forward to seeing how they were going to develop the idea of the Enterprise crew and the Romulan threat. They didn't. The Romulans turned out to be as inept as the Klingons, and the Enterprise crew turned out to be as inept as the original cast of the series. The Romulans were a bunch of amateurs who had no idea what to do with a war, and the Enterprise crew was a bunch of amateurs who had no idea what to do with a Romulan threat. What a waste of potential. I really enjoyed the original series and the movies, and this movie didn't live up to my expectations. The actors were ok, but not enough to compensate for the lack of substance.

Star Trek: First Contact is a good movie, but it is not a great one.

By Javier Ortiz

I have to say that this was a good movie. I don't think it was great, but it is still a good movie
 The first movie in the series, "2000 A.D." is a classic for a reason, but not for the reason that most people say it is a classic. The reason it's a classic is that it was a breakthrough in special effects, and it was the first movie to feature a computer generated dinosaur. But if you don't want to see a film that has a dinosaur in it, then don't waste your time. The movie is an action/sci-fi film with a suspenseful plot, but it is not one of the best. The movie is basically a rip-off of "Dune", except that the movie is not as good as the book. The movie was terrible, and there is no reason to see it. The only reason I saw the movie was because it had a dinosaur in it. I would recommend any other movie to see over this one.

Reviewer Rating: ** out of *****

Rating: PG-13

Running time: 1 hour, 27 minutes

Release date: December 18, 2000

Directed by: Roland Emmerich

Written by: Roland Emmerich, Dean Devlin, and Harald Kloser

 This film is not really a horror film as it is advertised, but more a comedy. It is also not a comedy, but more a drama. The film begins well with a bang, but it soon loses its way and doesn't gain it back. There are too many subplots which go nowhere and the ending is a bit of a let-down.

The acting is pretty poor and the characters are not believable. The only two actors who do a good job are the main director and the main writer. Sadly the director's name is not on the credits.

The film does have some good moments, but the bad outweighs the good.

I rate it 3/10.

I watched the director's first film 'Under the Shadow' (also on this site) and it was a good film, so I'm hoping that this one is too.

 I am so angry I am going to warn people about this movie. The trailer looked so good, it was going to be a killer horror movie. The reviews I read said it was a horror, but it really isn't. It's a movie about an old woman whose granddaughter was raped and murdered.<br /><br />The movie is supposed to be scary, but it isn't. It's just an old lady saying "why" over and over again.<br /><br />All in all, it's just a sad movie. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

(If you want a scary movie, try, "The Uninvited" or "The Grudge")

 The first thought that entered my head when I saw this movie was "what the hell is this, who made this, what is this movie about, what is this movie about, how did this ever get made?" Then the thought of "where's my popcorn?" came. This was a waste of time and money. Mr. De Niro and Mr. Krasinski made a couple of good movies in the past, but this one was a waste of time and money all around. There was a scene where some lady was trying to kill someone (I can't remember who was trying to kill who) and I guess it was in a bathroom (or kitchen). There was a scene where a couple was having sex and Mr. De Niro was having sex with the lady while she was asleep. I don't know what he was waiting for. I don't care if the lady was asleep. I don't know what the lady was thinking but maybe if she had told him to wait a little longer until she was awake. I watched the movie for about 10 minutes and turned it off. This movie sucked. I can't believe this movie got made. It was a waste of time and money.

 I was very disappointed in the movie. The opening scene was the most interesting part. The rest of the movie was just boring and predictable. I was hoping for a bit more action like in the book. I am a huge fan of the book, and read the book before I saw the movie. I was expecting more from the movie. The actors were good. I did not like the actors in the movie, but it was good for the kids to see a good movie. I would recommend the book, but not the movie.

I give it 3 out of 10.

My first favorite movie was the first Harry Potter movie.

If you are looking for a good movie to take the kids to, and they are Harry Potter fans, then you might want to take them to this one.

 After watching this movie, I have a lot of questions. Why do we have to suffer through a movie that's a complete waste of time? Why must movies that are based on the Bible have to be so poorly done? Why can't people actually write a script that is based on the Bible and not try to make it into something that it isn't? Why can't we have movies that don't try to be politically correct and stick to the facts? Why do we have to sit through a movie that is more about the actors than the actual plot?

 Unlike the other reviewers, I wasn't expecting a "great" movie but was hoping for an entertaining movie. That's what I got. No narative, no excitement, no real plot, just a bunch of men in the desert having a party. Not only is the action confusing, but the editing and camera work are terrible at times. The "surreal" moments won't even make sense. Think about it: a group of guys in the desert with a row of cars and a hooch house, and nobody talks? Not to mention John Travolta's performance was not only awkward, but laughable at times. When he is first introduced, he is being interviewed by a reporter. The reporter asks Travolta questions, and Travolta answers the questions with a blank stare. That's not acting, that's bad acting. A guy and his girl are having sex in the desert at night, and we are given a close up of the guy's hot dog....that's not dramatic, that's just weird. There is no story to this movie. The only reason I can think of to see this movie is if you are a fan of the star and his movies and you really want to see how
 I saw the movie on the Sci-Fi Channel a few months ago. It was awful. Although it was only about 30 minutes long and I wound up just fast forwarding through most of it, it was so boring and stupid that I had a hard time doing it. The plot is that the United States government has figured out a way to build a body that has a brain but no soul. They have successfully built one of these for a guy in a military prison to act as a spy for them. The movie is about, well, the spy. The movie is all about how he goes about his spy business. The plot is so stupid and boring that I can't tell you anything about it. If you like mindless, boring movies, then this is the movie for you. I had a hard time getting through it.

The only cool thing in the movie was Bill Paxton. He did a lot of his own stunts and he did a great job of it. The other actors were awful. I don't know if they were just inexperienced or not, but they really didn't do a good job.

I can't recommend this movie. It was so dull and pointless. I can only give it one star. It
 I have to say I was very disappointed with this movie. I had read the first book a few years ago and I was really looking forward to the movie. I wanted to see if they could adapt the story to the big screen. I was disappointed. The movie just seemed to drag on and on. There were no real character developments besides the main character and his relationship with his daughter. I would have liked to see more of the book in the movie. Maybe had the movie been longer we would have gotten to see more of the story. Maybe had there been more character development and less of the "splitting up" scenes I would have liked it more. I think the movie would have had a much better rating if there had been a little more character development. I had to constantly check the time because I just did not feel like sitting through another scene. The movie was a little too long for my taste and I was disappointed with the ending. It just seemed so rushed. I think the book was better. I really thought they should have stuck to the book more. I do not think the movie was all that bad but the book was much better. I think they could have done a lot more with the story. I think the movie

 You know, I thought it was going to be an interesting film, but I was wrong. It wasn't an interesting film at all, just a film about a crazy man. The acting was terrible, the story was boring, and the ending was crap. I'm sorry, but this is just one of those films I would just forget about, as it was just that. Boring and lame. I only watched it because my brother asked me to and I was bored, but I would advise against watching it, as it's just a film that you'll have to skip over on the TV, and you'll be much happier that way, believe me.

 I don't even know why I'm watching this movie. I've seen previous films of Stiller that were much better than this. I'm not even sure if the movie is funny. I'm just not entertained. I know that the actors are trying to be funny but they aren't. They're just saying the same lines over and over again and it's not funny. Each time these guys say a line, it's the same thing over and over again. The movie is very boring. The plot is weak and the characters are not very funny in this film. I'm glad I rented this film and could get it out of my collection. I don't think I will ever watch this film again. I think I would be better off just donating it to the local library. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.

I give this film a 1 out of 10.

 I have been watching this movie for the past 3 years - I just can't get enough! I love the characters and their relationships with one another. It is so sad to see them separate. Their "moments" are hilarious.<br /><br />This movie is one of my favorites and I'm so happy that I can get it on DVD.

<br /><br />I've seen every episode and every movie a hundred times - I love it. I've also thought of a few ideas on how to make a movie out of it (I'm very creative) but I don't think it would be right to make money out of something that was created for the entertainment of others.

<br /><br />We were all so excited when the movie came out. I just hope it will be available on DVD soon. I can't wait to watch it again!

<br /><br />I love this show and I hope they can make more great episodes!

<br /><br />I would love to see Mark DeCarlo again as Mark. He really has the best character on the show. He's so cute and adorable.

 This should be a documentary, not a movie. For a documentary, Michael Moore should have been allowed to be present and talk to the the people involved. He would have given a much better description of how things were, and NOT paint the whole situation with his own ignorant view.

The "newscasters" were obviously hired to give the impression that everyone was saying the same thing. I don't know what the people were thinking, but it was impossible to believe them.

The contrast between Michael Moore's ignorance and the stupidity of the people on the screen was incredibly painful.

I would like to believe that this documentary is exaggerating the situation, but if not, the people who were interviewed were not exaggerating their ignorance and stupidity.

I would like to have been one of the people in the film. I would have told them exactly what I thought of them. I would have told them that they should have been ashamed of themselves, that they should have been ashamed of the way they lived and the way they conducted their lives. I would have told them that they should have been ashamed of the way they let their children be raised. I would have told them that they should have been ashamed of the way they
 I don't understand how this film won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1996. I don't care how good the film is. It's a boring, annoying mess, and it doesn't deserve the award. The film is about a woman who gets raped and, as she tries to get justice, discovers that she has a mysterious affliction that causes her to be attacked by vampires. The film has lots of blood, which is a plus. It also has lots of nudity and sex and sex with blood. The main character is a prostitute, which is another plus. The main character is also a lesbian, which is another plus. But, this film's biggest plus is that it has lots of sex and sex with blood. I would rather watch porn than watch this, and I don't even like porn.

I won't give away any more details, but let's just say that this film is about a prostitute who becomes involved with a vampire, and also a policeman who wants to make her into a vampire. The film also has a mysterious disease that causes people to become attacked by vampires, and a woman who is a vampire. Oh, and a male prostitute and a female vampire. The characters are so utterly stupid and
 I have no idea why this movie is so popular. I've seen it a few times, and each time it seems to get worse. The bad acting, the bad writing, the bad directing, the bad everything. The story line is so contrived, so forced. There is no "suspense" in this film. There is no mystery, except that of seeing it again and again, because it is so bad. I have never seen such bad acting, so bad writing, so bad direction. I have never seen a movie with such bad editing, with such bad art direction, with such bad everything. There is no plot, no characters, no chemistry. It is all just a bad, horrible mess. The only reason it got into the mainstream is because of the upcoming movie, "The Matrix", which has a similar plot. The movie is based on the story of a computer hacker/terrorist, who is controlling the computer world, and who is trying to bring down the government. This movie is based on that same plot. The only difference is that it is not a computer hacker, it is a hacker on the run, and it's not terrorists, it's terrorists who are on the run. The movie is so stupid
 I have seen this movie before. I thought it was a good movie. I bought the DVD and watched it again. It is not a good movie! It is not scary! The only scary part about it is the trailer.<br /><br />The acting is terrible. The movie was made in 1990 and the acting is not much better now. The special effects are not good. The only thing the movie has going for it is the story. The story is good. It is about a young woman and her husband and her brother and the strange things that happen to them. The letters that the young woman receives and the pictures that she receives. The pictures are good. The letters are bad. The movie is not scary! If you really want to see a scary movie, watch the movie "The Exorcist" or "The Amityville Horror."

 I suppose I should have expected this to be a boring, worthless piece of work. It is. Little has been added to the old story and the tale is told in a way that many will consider stupid. The film is, for the most part, just a series of events that cannot be explained rationally. Even the zombie effects are weak and do little to raise the scares. I watched this with my daughter and we both agreed that it would have been better off on the "So bad it's good" shelf. My daughter made the comment that she would rather have watched Lawnmower Man 1 and 2 again (which she has). I have to agree. I can't recommend this to anyone expecting a decent horror film.

 I was excited to see this movie, but was very disappointed. This movie is a remake of a movie made in the 70s, with the same basic premise. Al Pacino stars in this version and he does a very good job. But the story is pretty weak and the pacing is very slow. The similar story of a brilliant scientist going crazy is one of my favorite movies, and this movie does not do it justice. I really wanted to like this movie, but was very disappointed.

Not great

By Tom7272

** spoiler alert ** I thought this movie was okay. I was a little let down by the ending, but was mostly happy with it. I think it could have been improved if the movie actually had some kind of dramatic conclusion. I thought it was a bit too calm. The ending seemed to be a bit of a letdown. The "re-imagining" of the film was also a bit weaker because it lacked the suspense of the original. I think if they had focused more on the suspense and less on the unrealistic mother-son relationship, it would have been a better movie with the same ending.

 I have never had a chance to see it but I have read what the fans say. Like all the other fans, I have done my homework and I have seen all the other films of the series. This one is terrible. It is not even the same genre as the rest of the films in the series. The first film was a horror. This one is a comedy. It is just not funny. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I do not know how much of the movie was shot on location. I do not know how much of it was shot in a studio. But I do know that the movie does not look like it was filmed in the woods. The movie is so awful, so bad, so unfunny, that I am surprised it was not released direct to video.

<br /><br />Unlike the other films, this one is not just stupid and poorly done. The movie does not start out stupid and poorly done. The film does not start out badly. It starts out well. The first scenes of the movie were so good, so funny and just so right, that I was shocked when the movie turned out to be so bad. It would have been
 This film is a complete waste of time. It was difficult to watch this film. I wanted to know what happened. The movie did not advance. The camera work was poor. The actors were not believable. The music was atrocious. The writing, directing and acting were all horrible. I do not care how many awards this movie won, it is a waste of time. Do not waste your time and money watching this film. I would have rather watched paint dry.

I thought this was a good movie. It had some good twists and turns. It was not predictable. The actors did an excellent job. The script was well written. The director did a great job. The camera work was excellent. The music was excellent. All in all, I thought this was a good movie. My only complaint is that the film was too long.

 I watched this movie a few weeks ago, it was so bad that I could not believe it. The acting was really bad, the script was really bad, the actresses will always be remembered for this movie, the costumes were terrible and the special effects were made of cardboard. I am a big fan of the "Lone Ranger" serie and I can say that this movie is to bad to even watch it once. I really hope that the producers of this movie will do a remake or else they will be the laughing stock of the world. I know that they are working on the "Lone Ranger" film, but I hope that they will not do it like this one. This movie is a disgrace to the "Lone Ranger" serie and the whole movie industry. I hope that the producers of this movie will get a lesson from this movie and will make a better film, just like the "Lone Ranger" serie. I am looking for a replacement for the "Lone Ranger" serie and I will not get it.

I will make this short, the first "Lone Ranger" serie was one of the greatest serie of all time, the second one was a really good movie,
 This movie is not only extremely boring and utterly unbelievable, it's also a direct ripoff of "The Princess Diaries". How can anyone sit through this piece of crap and honestly believe it's based on a true story? The entire story is completely unbelievable and it's completely boring. The only reason why this movie is able to keep your attention is because of the model-like appearance of the female lead. The story is so hard to follow, that you're constantly trying to figure out what's going on. It also has a totally predictable ending. I guess the only thing that kept me from giving this movie a 0 was because of the beautiful women in it. But even then, it's still a terrible movie.

Skip this one if you value your sanity.

 I just finished watching this movie on the Sci-Fi channel and I have to say it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The acting was that of a high school student playing his first role. I'm not sure if he was a man or a woman. I can't even imagine what kind of acting lessons he needed to get a part like this. The story was so bad that if I hadn't seen the whole thing I probably never would have believed it. I was very disappointed in this movie. There were parts that I didn't even believe were in the movie. It's so bad that it's not even funny. I can't believe anyone would pay $4.99 to watch such a horrible movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not worth a single penny. I'm glad this movie is out of print since I would never watch it again.

 Okay, I liked the trailers, so I went to see this film. I was disappointed. It is not a bad movie, it just wasn't good enough that I didn't mind the time I spent watching it. I'm sure you'll agree. The story was strange, the acting was mediocre and the effects were bad. The only thing I really liked about the movie is the fact that the main character was a 'normal guy'. I just don't like the idea of a guy that is 'cool' and 'good looking' and can do things that normal people can't do. That's about it. They could have made the movie better by using better actors. I like the idea of the movie, I just don't think the execution was up to par.

 This could have been interesting but it's just not. It starts off well with a couple of interesting ideas and a couple of good performances but then it just goes into a predictable "who-dunnit" and becomes a bit of a bore. I'm not entirely sure who the murderer is (although I think I'm fairly certain) and the film's really not that interesting. It's fairly slow moving and dull and for me, the ending is a bit of a let down. The film is a bit overlong and probably could have done with a bit more editing. Maybe a bit of judicious editing could have made this into a more interesting film. Not a bad one but not a good one either.

 This is a great example of a bad movie. The acting was very amateur, the story was horrible, the writing was non-existent, the direction was awful and the special effects were laughable. I would like to point out that I am a big VHS collector, so I am very familiar with bad movies. This is just bad. Avoid this one. There are much better movies out there that deserve your time and money. This is not one of them.

 I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel. I was shocked - I had been convinced that the movie was a major Sci-Fi Channel production, and that it was a great movie. Both were wrong.<br /><br />The story is about a man who travels through time and space to try to prevent the destruction of the universe. He is accompanied by a beautiful girl (whose character is supposed to be a love interest, but, as it turns out, she is a computer program all along). The man is an amalgam of different characters from all of the great Sci-Fi movies that I have ever seen. For example, he says "That's a bug" instead of "That's an antenna", and he has all of the cool gadgets like a hand-held rocket launcher, a flamethrower, and a laser gun. In fact, the most annoying thing about the movie was the fact that he had all of these great weapons, and yet they were never used. In the end, he is defeated by the woman who was actually an evil computer program all along, and it turns out that he was the bad guy all along. Then the movie ends.<br /><br />Why, oh why,
 I would like to tell you a story about a movie called "Slum Dog Millionaire," but before I do, I'd like to remind you that this isn't a review of the movie itself, it's a review of the movie trailer, which is so bad, it's almost criminal. I can't believe the people who made this trailer thought it was a good idea to use a bunch of clips that show a happy, poverty-stricken Indian family who win a lot of money in the lottery. What's even worse is that the Indian family looks completely American, which, if you look at the whole movie, it portrays the reality that most Indians are, which is, sad and poverty-stricken. To make things even worse, the trailer says that the reason the film is called "Slum Dog" is because it's about "slum doggerel." What the hell is "slum doggerel?" I realize that even making a bad movie can be a bad way to make an income, but this trailer is completely offensive. The trailer does have some good footage at the end, but it just makes you want to watch the movie even less. If you want to see a movie about how the lottery is
 This movie is a complete waste of time. It's inane, stupid, and boring. I read the book, and it was a much better movie. I would give it less than one star if I could. It should be burned. The only reason I saw it was because I was forced to watch it. I would never have went to see it if it wasn't for my boyfriend. I will never see this movie again. I hated it, I hated the book, and I hated the people who made this movie. This is a horrible movie. I hope this review persuades you to not go see it. I could give it no stars, but that wouldn't make it a zero.

 When I first saw this film I was excited, it looked like a great group of actors, a great story and a great director. I was proven wrong, I am surprised the movie didn't make more money, it was a complete waste of time. The story is about a young woman who is about to finish college, find a job and be with her boyfriend. But of course before all that she is kidnapped, and her boyfriend is framed for the crime. So the story is surprisingly interesting, but the film is so bad that it is almost impossible to sit through it. The acting is not very good, it is very amateurish and the film is very slow. I was hoping the film would get better, but it did not. I do not recommend this film, if you want to watch something a little more exciting rent "The Good Son".

 The first thing i have to say is that this movie is not the original. There are scenes which are a bit different and the movie has a different name.<br /><br />I have seen the original and i have to say this one is not worth watching. I know i am not a big fan of horror movies but i thought this one was just bad. The movie is not scary and the only reason i watched it was because of the guy who played the killer. I thought he was good but he is not the reason why i watched this.<br /><br />I do not recommend this one to anyone. There are better movies out there.

This is a great, underrated Friday the 13th film. I know that I am going to get a lot of haters for my opinion, but I really do like this film. I never got to see it originally when it came out, but when I finally got to see it, I really enjoyed it. It is a very fun film, and it is not really a horror
 I am a big fan of The Twilight Zone and still watch episodes when I get the chance. The Zone is one of the best shows ever made and it is a shame that they are rarely seen anymore. I have a number of VCRs but only one (of a series of two) is capable of recording. It is a great shame that I did not buy a second TV, as I could have recorded all of the Zone episodes, at least on tape.<br /><br />There are hundreds of episodes of The Zone, each with a different story and each with a different twist at the end. There is a theme to the Zone and it is usually a good one, it is a subject that is not often seen in other shows and it is a subject that is not discussed very often. The stories are also good, often very funny and very intriguing.<br /><br />I have all of the episodes that I could find and I have most of the episodes on tape. I like the Zone and always watch it when I can. This is a shame as the Zone is not being watched as much as it should be.<br /><br />I would like to see a Zone revival and would like to see a number
 This movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was horrible, the plot was weak and the movie was just very boring. I thought the movie was going to get better, but it never did. I don't recommend this movie to anybody. I'm sure if you watch it, you'll be bored to death. Three stars for the performances. One star for the rest.

Well, this was not the worst movie i ever seen. The movie had its funny moments, but it was not funny enough to give it more than two stars. From the beginning the movie was boring, but the ending was really funny, but it was a bit of a shame that
 I am a huge fan of the movie "The Outsiders". I like the book better, but this film is far more entertaining than the book. The movie is like a violent TV show, with a whole lot of violence, a lot of swearing, and lots of blood. Not to mention the violence and the swearing, there is a large amount of the book that is not made into the film. There is a scene in the book that is not in the film. There is a scene in the book that is in the film, but it is very different from the book. The book talks about the gang getting together to have a "fun" time and watch a group of girls dance. In the film, the gang meet at Ponyboy's house and watch the girls dance. The gang in the film are not the same gang in the book. The gang in the book includes the greasers, the blacks, the chavs, and the rich kids. The gang in the film includes a couple of greasers, some blacks, and a chav. The film is a very violent film, and so is the book. I think the book is a lot better than the film, but I think the film is easier to watch
 I was lucky enough to see this film at the Cannes film festival. I was expecting an intelligent, elegant film about the love between former lovers. Instead, I was introduced to a boring, slow film about a couple who are both involved with someone else. The film starts with a long, slow, boring opening sequence that makes the audience feel uncomfortable and claustrophobic. It is not clear to me what the audience's relationship is with the characters, other than that it is love based. The film is like a slow, sad version of "Sex, Lies, and Videotape", and I am not sure if this is a compliment or a cruel comment. The actors are good, but the rest of the film is not.

Jean-Luc Godard - an interesting filmmaker, always striving to make films that are unique and original - has made a film that is not unique, that is not original, and that is not an intelligent film. In fact, it is a film that is dull, slow, and uncomfortable to sit through. I don't know if Godard's films are this dull, slow, and uncomfortable, but I do know that his films are never this boring.

I would recommend this film to
 This movie is almost a perfect example of how a movie can go wrong. It starts with a great premise and story and then the writer fails to make it work. This is a movie that starts out good and ends up as a bad horror movie, with a completely predictable ending. I normally don't like horror movies but this really caught my attention and I really wanted it to work.<br /><br />The main character's name is Skylar. She is a small town girl who happens to be in the right place at the right time. She goes to the mall, and suddenly a small group of girls start killing people and exposing them as vampires. Skylar is one of the first victims and she is the only survivor. Once she is out of the mall with a policeman, she runs into a group of vampires and fights them, killing them all. She then goes to a mansion and kills three more vampires. She then comes across a vampire named Roman, who turns her into a vampire against her will. Then she is taken to his mansion by his son, and here the movie gets really good. After that the story stays fairly good, until the ending. The ending is predictable and nothing is really explained. I gave this movie
 This is a terrible movie. You see all these great actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, you think "Wow, this has to be good". But no, it's just a waste of time. I don't know why, but I just can't get into this movie. Maybe it's because the acting sucks, maybe it's because the movie itself just sucks, I don't know. I can't imagine anyone who would like this movie, who likes to watch movies. If you are in a bad mood, or if you are looking for a good movie, this probably isn't for you. But if you are in a good mood, I would advise you not to watch this.

<br /><br />"The Family Man" is a comedy, and I am not a big fan of comedy movies. The movie is about a man who is married to a woman and their three daughters. The funny thing is, he doesn't know they're his daughters and they don't know they're his daughters. So in the movie he plays a man called Frank who lives with his wife and three daughters. Now, I don't know if this is funny
 "The Bourne Identity" is a cookie cutter action film. The only difference between this and other action films is that the story is more complex. Unfortunately, the story is so complex that it is hard for the audience to connect with the protagonist. There are many twists and turns in the story that keep the audience guessing. The acting is very good, but the characters are one dimensional. The cinematography is spectacular, and the action scenes are very well choreographed and executed. The ending is a bit cheesy, but not too bad. If you like action films, this is a good one to see.

Rating - **

*** The Bourne Identity (Universal Pictures/Empire Pictures) ****

In "The Bourne Identity," director Doug Liman does a remarkable job. The film is filled with action and suspense. There is a bit of body switching here and there, but it is not too bad. The film is full of great scenes, and the acting is superb. The film is a bit slow paced in the beginning, but picks up in the middle and the end. "The Bourne Identity" is an excellent action film.

Rating - ****

**** The Bourne Identity (Universal Pictures
 I'm sure there are countless people out there who grew up on this stuff, and I'm sure there's some truly wonderful moments in these films, but I personally have never been able to enjoy them to that extent. They are never enjoyable, but I can at least admire their willingness to take risks and to try new things, but there is also a certain amount of boredom and repetitiveness to them as well.<br /><br />I don't know how many people here remember the old Dell Comics book "The Amazing Spider-Man" (1963-1966) where there was a whole bunch of different Spider-Man stories, but the one that stuck with me was the one where he was a pirate. I felt that was a really great idea and I really felt like I was watching a new kind of Spidey film, but sadly, that was never followed up on. I don't know why I feel like this, but I just don't see the appeal of these films. I think it's because the characters are very one-dimensional and don't have much depth, the plots are very thin and they don't always have much of a purpose and they don't always have a lot of originality.<br /><br
 I'm not sure if I was expecting too much from this movie, but it fell short of my expectations. I think the entire movie was a giant waste of time. It seemed like the makers of the movie were trying to make the movie very serious, but in the end they really failed. Everything was very slow and not enough action. I did like the way the movie was filmed at night, but other then that I didn't think it was a very good movie. I would have liked to see more of the gang and more action. I was always wondering what they would do next, but it really wasn't interesting enough. I had seen the previews and thought the movie looked pretty good, but I guess it really wasn't.<br /><br />After I saw this movie, I was very disappointed. I couldn't believe how bad it was. The first movie had so much potential, but it just fell short. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie, but I was very let down. I thought the movie was very boring, but I haven't seen a bad movie yet. I just couldn't help but watch it, so I praise the movie for making me watch it to the very end. I know it's
 This movie is so horribly written and executed that it makes me ill.<br /><br />This is the first movie to ever make me find it extremely hard to watch. The story is so boring that you begin to feel as if you are trapped in a time warp, being forced to watch a movie that was made by someone completely out of touch with reality. Words like 'uninteresting', 'boring', 'dumb' and 'pointless' come to mind. And this is not just a criticism of the movie, it's a criticism of what makes a good movie.<br /><br />This movie is like a bad book. It is trying to entertain you and it succeeds at that, but it does so in a very contrived way. The characters are all supposed to be stupid and uninteresting. But the movie doesn't feel like it's trying to entertain you. It feels like it's trying to bore you to death.<br /><br />The movie is completely devoid of any kind of logic or coherence. The characters, the situations and the events make no sense at all. The movie is so bad that it's actually funny at times. Take the scene where the two main characters are looking at a
 I watched a good portion of this film yesterday, and I have to say that I really didn't like it. As a big fan of the original film, I was really hoping that the remake would be better than the first. It just wasn't. The acting was pretty bad, and the movie itself was just boring. I know that I sound like a grumpy old man, but I really don't think that this film is worth watching at all. It's definitely not a waste of time, but it's not really worth watching. I went into this film with high expectations, and it failed to deliver. The plot was bad, the characters were weak, and the movie itself was just very boring.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the film is bad, I'm just saying that it's not as good as it could have been. I'll probably watch it again in the near future, but I don't think that I'll ever watch it again. I'm giving it a 4/10, because it's not bad, but it's not good either.

My opinion on the movie
 This film gathers together all the worst things about "Trainspotting" and adds a confused plot that seems to change at the last minute. I'm not sure what happened here. There are some good ideas, but they are corrupted by the misdirected and surreal humour. The characters are two-dimensional, the dialogue is awful and the plot is muddled and pointless. The scene in the graveyard was particularly depressing. The film was clearly a labor of love, but it's a labor that has been done badly. The film is short and the DVD is long, but it's still enough to get the point across.

1 out of 5

If you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, this isn't it. If you're looking for a film that will entertain you, it might do.

I'll be reviewing the sequel, "Trainspotting 2" in the next few days.

This film was made on a small budget and has a limited release.

I believe there is a US version of this film that has been released by Time Life Video, but it has no extras. I've seen it and it's a fraction of the size of the UK release.

There
 I'm a little upset that I wasted my time on this movie. It was just a bunch of random footage put together. If you have nothing to do and nothing to watch on TV, I guess it would be a good thing to have on DVD for the next time you are stuck at home. There wasn't enough action in the movie to keep me awake, the acting was absolutely terrible, the editing was horrible, and the plot was just too weird. If you like ridiculous plots and are bored, then you will probably enjoy this movie. If you're looking for a good movie, this isn't it.

This is a horrible movie, especially if you want to see a good movie. The only thing that saves it is the special effects are very good, but overall,
 I am a HUGE fan of the first two "Goonies" movies, so I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. I thought it graphically looked better than the first two, but it was still lacking. One of the major problems was the lack of good writing. The character of "Harpoon Harry" is an annoying guy who is always telling a joke and cracking a joke. This guy is not funny, and the jokes aren't even that good. I also hated the fact that they played the "The Goonies" song in the background all the time. This movie is also lacking in the emotional department. It's just not very believable. Overall, this movie is a simple movie, with no depth. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is better than "The Goonies II".

3/10

This movie is a sequel to the first goonies movie. The kids go on a family adventure, but they have to fight the goonies from the first movie. This movie is good, but it's not as good as the first one.

9/10

I love this movie! The first two parts are awesome,
 First off, I want to say that I am a big fan of the 1970s TV show "The Hardy Boys", and I think that it was one of the best and most influential programs in the history of television. So, I was very disappointed to see that this movie was trying to do the same thing as the series.<br /><br />I was also very disappointed to see that the series was not very well done for the most part. I think that it is worth noting that the book that was adapted for the series was not terribly well written. The movie, however, continued this trend. By the way, the movie is based on the third book of the series. It is a lot more difficult to adapt a book that was written in this era, which I think is the reason why it sucked so badly. The Hardy Boys books were a lot better written.<br /><br />The movie is, of course, about the Hardy boys going after the evil Fenton (Tim Reid), who, of course, is going to try to steal the treasure of the Ark of the Covenant. I will say that, in a way, the movie is a lot more entertaining than the TV series. The TV show had a lot
 This is a low-budget horror film, and obviously one of the lower-budgeted ones. The acting, particularly by the two leads, is not good, and the plot is thin and weak.<br /><br />The film is about two friends who go to a remote spot in Canada, where they encounter a broken-down old house. They are robbed, and the old house is haunted. The first half of the film is slow and quite boring, although not quite as boring as the sequel.<br /><br />The movie's weakest point is the music, which is a bit on the cheesy side. The second half of the film is much better, as it moves from the slow pace of the first half to a fast-paced and exciting finale. Overall, the movie is not a total waste of time, but if you just want to see it so you can argue with someone that the story is bad, then you might be disappointed. However, if you watch it expecting it to be a good horror film, like it's director intended, then you won't be disappointed.

2.0 out of 5 stars Don't bother. Poorly acted and written. VINE VOICE I don't usually review
 Well, I've seen a lot of bad movies, and I've seen some that are so bad they're painful to watch. I've seen some that are so bad they make you wonder how they got made in the first place. And then I've seen one that is so bad it's beyond description. This movie is one of them.<br /><br />This was a movie that I saw at the movies, which is unusual for me, as I almost never watch movies, and I don't go to the movies all that often. I usually watch tv, although I do occasionally watch a movie on free tv, and I've watched several on cable. But I never watch movies, even on cable. I'm not one of those people who has to watch every movie that comes out, and I'm especially not one of those people who has to see every movie that comes out. I'm cool with that, and I'm aware that there are people who make a living doing things I don't want to do, like weed or go to work or get a job or even vote.<br /><br />Anyway, I saw this movie at the movies, and I was feeling pretty good about things. I'd finished up a
 Im a big fan of the old horror films, and when I saw this I was hoping it would be more like "The Last House On The Left", but it was a disappointment. It had a few good ideas, but they just didn't mesh well together. The plot was the same old formula, the heroine is constantly being chased by the killer, and she is constantly screamin in terror, and when she finally catches the killer, she kills him right away. The killer is also different, he is a blonde haired guy, who wears white gloves, and he can turn his hands into claws, you can really see the claws in the movie, but the biggest letdown for me was the acting. Most of the actors were pretty bad, there was one actress who didn't do a whole lot of acting, but she was the best. I was very disappointed in this movie, I think it was the worst movie I have seen in a long time, and I think it's going to be one of the worst movies of this year. This movie is supposed to have a sequel, so maybe next time they will have a better cast and better effects.

Disappointing

Overall
 I've just seen this movie for the first time, and I don't understand why the rating is so high. There's not much to say about the movie itself, except that it's far from being the best movie ever. The plot is bad, and the characters are not interesting. Even the actors are not so great, although some of them are good. I like the two main characters, and I think they could be a good couple. Even they have a good chemistry, but it doesn't make the movie very good. I think this movie is not worth it, since there is a lot of bad movies out there, the same way there is a lot of good movies. I recommend this movie only to people who are looking for a good quote.

"When I was a boy, I saw a film called "War of the Worlds" and I realized that the world wasn't real. And then I had to go on and answer the question, "What is real?" I have found out that the only thing that's real is that I'm here, and that's what I'm going to go on believing. I'm going to be real, and I'm going to live it."

-Tom Robbins

 The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was really good. The acting was great, and it was a nice little story about a ghost and a girl who were in love. But, I have watched that movie so many times that I now hate it. I think that it is a terrible movie. I don't like the acting, or the story, or the way that it was filmed. I almost feel like I am being force-fed the movie. One of my friends told me that it was really good, and that I would like it. I don't know what made him think that, I guess he likes it, but I don't. I think that if you like this movie, then you are a complete idiot, because it is horrible. I can't believe that this movie is so popular. If you are going to see this movie, don't say you like it, because I don't.

If you have seen this movie, and like it, please tell me why. I would like to know.

Watch the movie!
 I have to say that I've seen a lot of terrible horror films. However, I'm a fan of the genre and have seen a lot of good ones. I must say that this one was awful. First of all, the acting was terrible. When the film started, I wasn't expecting much. However, it turned out that the actors were terrible. The plot was predictable and uninteresting. I could barely pay attention to it and it didn't have any kind of twist. The film also had a very creepy score and the cinematography was good. So, there was a lot of potential in this film. The only good thing about this film was the special effects. They were very well done. Overall, this was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Do NOT see it.

 A couple of friends and I were going to see "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" at the local art house theater. When we got there, we were really excited because the box office was packed. When we got inside, we found out that the movie was sold out. So we were all bummed out and decided to go to another movie. (We were only hoping for an hour or so.) We thought we would check out "The Last Samurai" because it was playing on the other side of town, and we needed to kill some time. When we got there, we found out that the movie was sold out. That pretty much convinced us to go back to "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." The movie was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend it.<br /><br />So my friends and I went back to the first movie. It was a good movie, but nothing spectacular. So we went back to our second choice.

 I'm going to try to give this film a fair review. It has some good moments, but overall, it's pretty pathetic. My problem with the movie is that all the acting is awful. I mean, it's not bad, but it's not good, either. The actors don't have much of a command of the English language, and they seem a little unsure if they're in an English-speaking country or not. There's also a lot of mumbling, which just makes it worse. The acting could have used a lot better direction, too. I don't understand how they were able to score so well with the music, because the performances in this movie were pretty bad. The story is pretty much a rip-off of Blade Runner and Alien, both of which are great movies. This movie is just plain stupid.<br /><br />I would give this movie three stars only because of the acting. I can't imagine what it would have been like with better actors. Maybe if I had seen this movie in the theater, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it so much. But I'm not sure I would have been able to follow the story, either. I would not recommend this movie to anyone
 I think it is fair to say that "The Last of the Mohicans" is one of the best movies ever made. It has one of the greatest opening songs ever, "The Last of the Mohicans". I also like the fact that the movie is based on a true story. However, I think the movie shows a lot of violence and brutality. There are some scenes where the characters are in a lot of danger and there are some scenes where people are being shot at. I think the movie does not give a very fair account of the French and Indian War, because the movie shows that it was a war of the whites against the Indians. The movie also shows the settlers being ill-treated and not being treated equally by the Native Americans.

I think "The Last of the Mohicans" is one of the best movies ever made, especially for the amount of action and violence it contains. I also think it is one of the best movies ever made for the amount of romance it contains. However, I do not think the movie shows the French and Indian War in a fair light. I also think that the movie does not give a very fair account of the settlers.

I think that "The Last of the Moh
 This is the first year that I didn't vote for a movie in the Oscar race. I was so disappointed in this film that I felt I couldn't vote for it. It was poorly written, poorly acted, and the director made a serious error in not setting the film in England. The director should have been shot for his major error. The film should have been set in England, not in the United States. Most of the dialogue was laughable, and all of it was unrealistic. The story, if you can call it that, was so bad that I wouldn't even wish it to the worst enemy I ever had. I am so disappointed in this film that I am going to watch the DVD and make sure that it is better than this film.

 I saw this movie in the theater thinking it would be a good movie and the only movie that would come close to approaching "The Sixth Sense" for me. Well I was wrong. I don't know what people were thinking making this movie. There is no plot at all to this movie if you don't count the drug dealer. There are no suspenseful moments. There is no sex. There is no humor. There is no reason that this movie should be made other than that maybe the producer was drunk. There is no reason for this movie to be made. There is nothing redeeming about this movie at all. I was in the theater with my girlfriend and we both hated this movie. I am going to rent this movie and try to figure out why the hell it was made. I would give this movie a zero if I could. I loved the Sixth Sense. This is not a good movie.

 I watched this movie yesterday again and I wanted to write a review but couldn't. I've seen this movie two times already. I think it's so bad that it's not funny. I've never laughed so much in my life. The killer is so funny and the killer is so obvious. I don't know the killer but I would say the killer is the most funny character in the whole movie. I'm really really really not interested in this movie. I didn't have a lot of hopes for this movie because this movie is so bad and I mean so bad. The only thing that is good about this movie is the killer, the killer is hilarious. There's just no need to watch this movie. I mean there's no need to watch this movie. This is the most boring thing I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of boring stuff.

 The best thing I can say about this film is that I got a nice cheap laugh out of it when I read the description of it. I tried to watch it over the weekend, but I just couldn't do it. It's like a bad student film, or a bad porno. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />It's completely ridiculous. A male character is having sex with a female character, when suddenly the female character turns into a male character. The sex scene is so outrageous that it's as if the director was trying to outdo himself with each shot. The sex scene is so ridiculously over the top that it makes you laugh.<br /><br />I was hoping that the film would get a little more inventive than just the same old sex scene. But the film doesn't really get going until it's almost over. Then the whole thing starts to make sense. When the film is almost over, it makes sense. It's like watching a horror film, when the monster looks like a real monster, but as the film progresses, the monster gets more and more ridiculous. At the very end, the monster is so ridiculous that it's actually laughable.<br /><br />I can

 A great many people died during the filming of this movie. I remember watching it as a child and being amazed at the carnage. Now I just see a big waste of time. The acting is bad. The special effects are bad. And the story is bad. I guess this was just a cheap way to get some money out of the public. It's not a bad movie for children. It's just a bad movie for everyone else.

I thought that this was an excellent movie.
 A bunch of rich white kids get together and talk about their lives as they try to escape their boring lives in this film. The main character wants to get away from his boring, stuck up mother. He gets into a fight with his older brother which gives him the idea to run away to a mythical place in the woods. Of course the whole film is about how the main character and his friends get along and get into a whole lot of trouble. The film was filmed entirely in one location in the woods near a lake. The whole film is shot with a lot of "fly-in-shot" and is pretty funny when you're not bored. I liked the fact that the whole film was shot in one place. It was also pretty creative. This film is also pretty funny at times, but the main character is pretty annoying. The film also has a weird ending. If you're bored, this film would be a good choice.

2.5/10

I give it a 2.5 out of 10

"I can't believe I'm in this movie. It's so dumb. I didn't even get to wear my own clothes."

"Hey, maybe this will be our new thing."
 I was so excited to see "The Egg and I" that I bought it on a free day. I had never seen the original or read the book, but I thought it would be a good family movie. I was so very wrong. The movie is full of terrible acting, horrible dialogue and horrible action. The plot was hard to follow, and the characters were hard to care about. The main character, Lucy, is a horrible person, who is selfish and mean to her family and friends. She also has a very unlikable husband, and her children are not likable. I found myself rooting for a villain, as I hated Lucy. I did not know what to think of the ending, as it seemed to have a clearmoral, but I still have no clue. The whole movie, I kept expecting the boy to d his father, but the end revealed that the mother did it, and I was forced to change my mind and think, "What is the point?" I would never recommend this movie to anyone, and I would never watch it again.

 I was going to give this movie a five because the acting was good, but the rest of the movie was a total waste of my time!<br /><br />The acting was good and it was a nice idea for a movie, but there were a few things that really bothered me about this movie. The acting was good, but the characters were not consistent with their personalities. There was a scene where the main character was ready to kill a guy and then in the next scene he was crying and begging for help. The character could have been a sociopath or a psychopath, but actually the only thing that the character was was a nice guy. The other thing that really bothered me was the lack of background music. There was no background music during the entire movie. This is a movie that you would have to watch it in a theater with surround sound so you can experience the sound. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. This movie is not funny and if you have already seen it you have already wasted your time.

 For the second time in my life I am forced to write a review for a movie I really didn't like.<br /><br />First, a brief history. I have heard some great things about this movie even though I had never watched it. I was at the movies one night and all I heard about was how this movie is, in the words of one of my friends, a "piece of sh*t." So I decided to check it out. I hate to say it, but I am a huge fan of the Austin Powers films, and I thought this could be a good addition to that series. I was wrong. In fact, I hate to think of the film as being on par with the Austin Powers films. It was absolutely awful. I can't even express how much I hated this movie. And honestly, I only watched it because I was bored. I couldn't believe how much I hated it. The only reason this movie was able to stay in theaters for as long as it did was because of the good reviews it had. But I just can't believe how much I hate this movie. I don't think I've ever hated a movie before, so I'm not sure what the record is for the
 It's easy to say that "Heading South" is the worst movie ever made. It might even be the worst movie ever made that I've seen. I can't imagine anything that could be worse than this. The plot was so terribly put together and so weak that I can't imagine how they were able to get it made. I'm not even sure how they managed to get the funds to make it. The acting was so terrible, I can't even begin to describe it. I suppose it's possible to make a movie with no acting at all. It's just that the acting in this was so dreadful, I doubt it. I think it was the only movie I've ever seen that was so bad that I wouldn't be surprised if some kind of mob started beating people over the head with a blunt object to keep them from trying to see it again. The plot has something to do with a man who wants to build a huge resort called "The Fell" in the middle of a wilderness area. He hires a couple of stupid guys to work for him who don't do much work and kill a bear. He then kills the bear and makes a fake one out of a rib cage and a pair of boots. He kills
 I think that your review doesn't do this film justice. I am a huge fan of the original "Benny and Joon" and have seen almost every version of the film. This, however, is by far the worst. The film is often "jumpy", and the editing is very disjointed. It doesn't flow smoothly and the transitions from scene to scene often leave you wondering where you are and what you have just seen. The editing seems like a lot of the film was shot by someone who had never seen a film before. There is a scene when Joon is in the hospital with Dr. Benson and then later in a bar with Dr. Benson and the nurse. These two scenes are filmed in almost the exact same manner. They are shot from a different angle and the lighting is different. It is not as though you have to concentrate on the film too hard to notice the difference. It is simply bad editing. There are also some scenes that are completely ridiculous. There is a scene where Benny and Joon are talking in the bar and then they leave, and then Benny and Joon are back in the bar. This is just one example of a scene that is completely illogical.

There are also
 I absolutely hated this movie. There is only one redeeming quality in this movie: the soundtrack. Most of the CD is the original score composed by John Williams, but the bits that weren't used in the film are great as well. It's a shame that the movie was so poor, as I have always been a fan of the original trilogy. The acting is terrible, the script is terrible, and the special effects are just horrible. I would have to say that this is the worst Star Wars film yet. I would give this a 2/10.

 this movie was the first movie that i have seen that was so bad that i have to give it 10. it is not funny. it is not even scary. it is just plain stupid. they are making fun of all the other horror flicks. it is truly the worst movie ever made. i do not understand why people like this movie when it is so bad. if you want to see a good scary movie then watch any other one but this one. i just hope that this movie does not get made again. i hope that this movie will never be released again. i know that the movie is very good and that it is a great movie but this movie is so bad that i will never let my friends see this movie again. i do not understand why people like this movie. the only thing that i can say about this movie is that it is a very bad movie. this movie should never be in the theaters again. i hope that no one will ever make a movie that is just as bad as this movie. this movie should never be released again. it is a movie that no one should see. if i had to rate this movie i would give it 0 out of 10. it is the worst movie i have ever seen
 I just saw this movie and was hoping it was better than it was. I usually dislike these types of movies but the trailers looked good so I gave it a shot. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. It seemed to me that they took so long to get the story going. The story was very slow and even though I love the actors, I felt that they didn't have enough screen time. I was glad that they didn't have the entire movie on a boat but the beginning was so slow I almost fell asleep. The story was about a father and son who were shipwrecked and had to survive on a boat for a year. The father (played by Sean Connery) was a drunk and the son (played by Jon Seda) had to be the one to keep him alive and sane. I was pleased when the father had a "revelation" but it didn't seem that it was a real revelation, it was more like a drunken ramble. I also didn't like the ending. I wanted to see the father and son reunited but it seemed to me that they just gave up on the boat and the other survivors and sailed off into the sunset.

I thought this movie was boring and
 What have I done wrong? I have never felt that jaded with a film before. This movie was undeniably bad.<br /><br />We have seen the best of this genre in "True Romance," "The Big Lebowski," and "Twin Peaks." This attempt is so ineptly written and directed, it is beyond belief that this film was made. It is almost laughable. I am devastated. I can't even discuss the movie without sounding like a sad, bitter fanboy. Now, where did I put my "Kill Bill Vol. 1" DVD? This is more like it.<br /><br />The performances are lackluster to say the least. The actors are so wooden and unentertaining, it is laughable. I am watching a film and saying to myself, "Where's the flare? Where's the passion?"<br /><br />I think I can hear my own voice: "It's the director's fault. It's the script. They picked the wrong actors. There's no chemistry between the actors, there's no wit, there's no chemistry, there's no nothing."

The only saving grace is that no one could have predicted this film would have been so bad
 Does it really matter whether or not the film was directed by Roger Corman? More than anything else, it is a very, very poor film that never reaches the level of mediocrity necessary to be seen as a classic. It is almost as if a Corman film were just a vehicle for a bunch of pretty faces. The actors, particularly the male lead, do little to elevate the film, although the female lead is quite good but is given very little to do. It is a very dull film that probably got a lot of people to see it because it was directed by Corman. The story is at best mediocre and the action is very dull. There is one scene that is pretty good, but it is still not enough to make the film worth watching. I doubt that anyone will ever watch this film again after seeing it the first time. It is not a film that will keep you interested for any length of time.

 This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I will never ever see anything like it again in my life. I just can't believe that such a movie was made. If you think this is good, than I am sorry for you. You have to think that the people behind this are complete morons. This is just the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Nothing but tears and pain. I think that this is the most insulting movie I have ever seen. I think that this is the most insulting movie I have ever seen. Nothing but lame jokes and horrible acting.

 This is about as boring as a movie can be...and that is saying a lot, because if you're a moviegoer, then you know what a boring movie is. This movie sucks. It's so bad that I would recommend it to anyone who has a life expectancy of less than three months. The only thing that could save this movie from being a complete disaster is if all of the people involved in making this movie were to die and never be heard from again. I'm not kidding, the only reason this movie has 1 star is because I like to be a nice person.<br /><br />I think that the best thing to say about this movie is that it's better than "Purple People Eater" (which is actually a pretty good movie). This is a so-bad-it's-good movie. I would have rated it a 0, but I have standards. I have the standards of a good person.

 I'm sure it's just me who finds this film as an utter bore. The acting is poor, the script is lousy, and the director looked to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The only interesting thing in it is the idea of an alien invasion. The alien doesn't seem to be a real alien and the human characters are just pathetic. I don't think it's a good idea to make a film with a plot that suggests the end of the world. It would be much better to make a film that shows the human race as a whole trying to cope with the end of the world. I guess this is what Mr. Carpenter is trying to do, but unfortunately for him, he won't get the same results. It's a pity because he could have made a very interesting film if only he had a better script and director.

 I know this movie is a classic and all, but I don't think it's worth watching. The acting is really bad and the storyline is tiresome and boring.<br /><br />I would say, A Clockwork Orange is a must watch for the fans and for the people who like to watch classic movies. But don't watch it for the storyline, because it is extremely boring and not very appealing at all.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie with a great storyline, go to see the Matrix series. A Clockwork Orange is an overrated movie, which doesn't deserve all the praise it gets.

 I was disappointed in this film. The plot was very predictable and the characters were not very likable. The ending was also very weak. I also thought the acting was poor. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The plot is about two couples: A young couple and a retired couple. The young couple are in love. The retired couple have never been married and were really unhappy about that. The movie begins with the young couple waiting for their first date. They are driving to a restaurant and the young woman is driving very fast. She is driving on the wrong side of the road and almost hits a police car. The young man is very annoyed and he says that he never wants to drive with her again. The couple has a fight which they think is their last. The young man goes out and meets a girl and they have sex. He is happy and forgives her, but the old woman has a heart attack and dies. The young man is very upset and he says that he has to tell the young woman what happened. She is very upset and they get into a fight. The young man says that he is going to find a woman
 This movie is so bad that it is hard to know where to begin. I'd say it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is bad. The script is stupid. The directing is awful. The cinematography is horrible. The directing and cinematography teams should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to be released to the public. I just can't believe that there were people involved in this who were able to give their approval. This movie has a very distinctive look to it, but it's so bad I don't even want to think about it. There is no redeeming quality about this film. I guess the only thing the movie has going for it is the inclusion of some of the best known female porn stars of the late 70's. But even those girls can't save this movie. I'd give it a minus 50/100 on the -50 to 100 scale.

(I am a fan of porn and its more mainstream counterparts, so I don't have a problem with porn movies).

The rating is based on the combination of horrible direction, bad acting, bad plot, and bad everything else. No plot, no story, no
 I thought it would be a good movie because it had the lovely, I would say pretty, actress, Terri Hatcher, in it. Why? Because I love her. I thought it would be a romantic comedy, because of her and her husband, but it wasn't. It was a horrible, horrible movie. I just couldn't get into it, and I had never seen the show. Why? Because I watch a lot of movies and I don't sit through a movie just to see a movie star. I don't even agree with that. I think that if a movie is so bad that it sucks, it should not be watched, but instead, it should be burned. Because it's bad. And this movie was bad. Terri Hatcher is a good actress, but she can't save a bad script. This was just awful. I am sure that some of you might have seen the show, and watched it, but I did not. I even have it on DVD, but I don't watch it because I don't like it. I don't agree with the show at all. I don't like the show. I don't like Terri Hatcher. And I don't like this movie.
 I had seen the original "Psycho" when I was a child and, although I had the utmost respect for that film, I hadn't seen the remake when I was younger.<br /><br />I can't tell if I was expecting too much or if this film fell flat in a way that reminded me of the original. The only thing I can really compare this to is "The Birds". The similarities between this and the original are staggering, but the story is entirely different. The original is a classic, but this remake has the same problems that only a few films have. The beginning is just not enough and the last half hour of the movie is just poorly put together and not enough thought was put into it. The story of course is not completely different and the end is predictable, but it is the shortcomings that make it fail. The acting is just not enough and this is one of those films that you want to see just because it's a great movie and not just because of the quality of the actors.<br /><br />If you want to see a good version of the original, see the original. For those who are still curious, see the original.

Reviewer Score: 3

 This is one of those movies that you watch and can't figure out what's going on. I think it's a combination of the weird looking alien, the strange looking human and the loud clunky sound effects. But, it's the movie itself that's the worst part. Not only is it not scary, it's not even scary in the right way. I mean, sure, you want to be scared, but you don't want to become scared. You want to be scared, but you want to be scared in the right way. This is not the right way. The aliens are all perfect looking and the humans are all perfect looking, but they're all scared of the aliens. It's just too perfect. It's the same as when you watch a horror movie and the victim is always the one who gets killed and not the one who tries to kill the victim. It's a very strange movie and I don't recommend it.

 This film was originally shown in a retrospective at the Berlin Film Festival. The theme of the movie was the beginning of the Third Reich, but it was more than a year before Hitler took power. This is a movie in which the Nazis are still a small minority. Hitler is a drunken, unkempt rabble-rouser, who is led by a respected officer of the German army, who is trying to end the war. The movie is well-acted, but the story is not very good. The main character is Jewish, and the movie's point of view is that the Jews are the "bad guys". The movie makes no attempt to show the human side of any of the characters. It merely portrays the Nazis as the "bad guys". The point of view of the audience is that the Jews are the "bad guys" and the Nazis are the "good guys", but there is no attempt to show why this is so. The film is well-made, but it is not very good.

I'm not a fan of movies set during the Nazi era. I generally find that they are more interested in the politics
 I really liked the first season of the show, but when the second season started I knew i had to stop watching. It is just bad. The plot is so stupid, the acting is bad and the jokes are very bad. I was always hoping for a good episode but i never got one. I would really like to watch the last season and see how it ends, i really hope it is good.

By the way: I hope they will not make any more episodes!

I hope you enjoyed my review!

Bye Bye!

 The movie "The Wild Bunch" is one of the best movie's ever made. The last half hour is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. The last scene is so good, it's almost unbelievable. The scene is where the men have just been massacred by the Mexican army, and the women and children of the village have been taken captive. The last scene has the women, children, and the vulture that survived the massacre, all standing in a very small circle, and the women and children holding hands. All of them are crying, and the women are chanting, "Los Panchos! Los Panchos!" The vulture is singing the song ("The Road to Los Panchos" by The Champs), and they all start dancing in a circle. The camera pans from the women and children to the men, and the men are still dead. The camera goes to the vulture, who flies over the corpses and lands in front of the women and children. The women and children all promise to follow the vulture to Los Panchos, and the vulture flies off with the women and children. The vulture flies over the village, and then it flies over the men and women in the
 The suspense was also missing in this movie. It is a very long movie, but it is boring. I won't mind watching it again to see if I missed something.

 This movie is a total piece of crap. The only thing semi-liked about it was the music. The end of the movie was a total letdown. The only thing that was good was the music. The acting was so bad it was no wonder. I don't care if you are "big" or "small" you can't make up a story about your life and expect people to believe it.

The movie was great but i think that the movie should have been left to be in the hands of the writer and not a Hollywood screenwriter.

 This is the worst film I've ever seen. I saw this in the late eighties, and I was in the eighth grade. It's about a local high school kid who does not have a very good life. He's a nerd and a bit of a loser and all his friends seem to bully him. So one day, he gets revenge. He decides to take his girlfriend out on a date. She tells him that her parents won't let her, so the kid decides to take the girl to a field to be killed by a psycho who is a serial killer. He's so determined that he doesn't even let the girl know what's going on. It's all a big secret. The psycho kills the girl, and the kid goes home to his father. At first, it looks like the dad will be angry with him, but then he hugs the kid. The film ends with the father saying that he loves his son. It's disgusting. The film is shown in three parts. First, the psycho kills the girl and the kid goes home. Then, the kid goes back to school to pick up his stuff. Then, there's a scene where the psycho is killing another girl. I don't know why there is
 At first, I thought this movie was worth watching, but after the first half, i soon began to lose interest and turned it off. I was surprised how bad this movie was, i thought the actors were decent, but the writing was really bad, and the story was terribly arranged. This movie was not funny, and it was not scary, it was just an awful movie.

The writing wasn't terrible, it was just plain, and the story wasn't terrifying, it was just plain boring. The acting was okay, i really liked Robin Dunne (whoever he was), and there was a couple of other actors in the movie that i liked, but the rest of the actors were just plain bad. I think i saw who the actors were in this movie, but i can't remember because the movie was so terrible, i just wanted it to end. I was hoping that the movie would get better and it would turn into a good movie, but it didn't, it just got worse. I would give this movie 0/10, and i wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. I also don't think that this movie was scary, it was just plain boring, and i don't think that it was
 I don't know what it is about this movie, but I've seen it a dozen times and never got it. The basic plot is that an obese woman (very very obese) and her ex-husband (who is also obese) come together to have a child. The ex-husband's body is a hot mess of fat and veins. The woman has a very clear body, small breasts and a very convincing pregnancy. But the part that kind of leaves you baffled is, why does the husband change so much? Is it just that he is depressed because his wife is pregnant or has a baby or something? I don't know. It's one of those movies that doesn't make much sense and you can't figure out what is going on until the last 20 minutes of the movie. The acting by the cast is terrible. I think they must have had a bad director and someone who couldn't be bothered to explain the story. Anyway, I guess it is on my list of "most watched" movies I've ever seen, but I don't think that it's worth watching again. It's just a very boring movie.

 I am not a fan of the previous Kinski-starring film "The House" (or "End of the World"), but it was tolerable. I did not care for Kinski in that film, either. "The Return" is even more unbearable as a character and a film. Kinski's character is a complete and total mess and the film is a total mess. "The Return" is a pretty run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic horror film. It's nothing spectacular. The film's story is pretty basic and the characters are pretty bland. The film's only redeeming quality is its stunning cinematography. The film's violent scenes are not very violent, but they are still pretty bloody. The film's story is pretty straightforward. The whole film is pretty slow and pointless. You won't learn anything or make any connections or have an emotional connection with the characters or the story. The film's soundtrack is pretty mediocre. I really can't recommend this film.

 This film is a complete and utter mess. First of all, even by the standards of low-budget straight-to-video films, this thing is a complete mess. It's shot in a very strange, unprofessional style, with an extremely loud, dramatic soundtrack, some pretty bad "special effects", and absolutely zero plot whatsoever. The acting is the only thing that keeps it from being a complete disaster. The plot is so ludicrous, it's hard to believe that anyone would write it, let alone actually make a movie out there with it. and yet, I have seen this movie, and I am still scratching my head trying to figure out how, exactly. I'm not saying that it's a good movie, because it's not. However, it's not all that bad, either. The acting is pretty good, and the action scenes are okay. I can't say that I really like this movie, but I can say that I'm not bored by it. It's like a train wreck, where you just keep coming back to watch it. It's not the worst thing I've seen, but it's definitely not good, either.

The story is about a group of teens who go to a local carn
 If you have an interest in the paranormal and enjoy good sci-fi, you'll probably like this movie. I enjoyed it and did not find any of the acting to be a problem, but it's definitely not a horror movie. If you have an interest in the paranormal, you'll also probably like this movie, but it's not a horror movie. However, if you're a horror fan, you may not like it. This movie, while it is not a horror movie, is not really a sci-fi movie either. It's a cross between a horror and a sci-fi movie. I'm not a fan of science fiction, but I am a fan of horror, so I did find it interesting. I'd say it's a good movie if you're interested in the paranormal.

 The movie was not bad at all. But it was not the classic that was expected. The movie was very slow and there was not much action. The movie lost focus and ended up being a little overdone. There were some good ideas in the movie but it was not executed well. It was not the best movie in this genre but it was not the worst. The movie was good enough to watch as a rental but nothing to buy. If you like more action than this movie will probably not be to your liking. But it was not bad. I give it a 6 out of 10.

**This is a movie review of "Pox Americana" I am not the writer of the movie.**

I was really looking forward to this movie. I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed the movie. This movie was a little different than the typical movie. The movie was about a small town and how it was affected by the discovery of a deadly virus by a government secret agency. The movie was very suspenseful and had some good ideas. The movie was not very long, but it had a great story. This movie was very original and was not another typical zombie movie. This movie was
 I generally enjoy Japanese movies, and I was looking forward to watching this one. As soon as I saw who was in it I decided to pass. There are only a few Japanese actors I've seen who have managed to make me love their work, and the only one who has managed this is Hideo Nakata (Deep Sleep, Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water). I was hoping that the same would happen with this movie, but it didn't. The only good thing about this movie is that the plot is original and, unlike a lot of horror movies, there were some "twists" in it which I found really good and that kept you guessing. But all these flaws don't make up for the fact that the movie was absolutely boring and lame. I would have given it a 3 if it was made by a Japanese director and released in Japan. Japan is a country that has been extremely successful in film making, and this is a shame as I believe that a lot of American and European horror fans would love to watch a good Japanese horror movie.

Cherry Blossoms of War
 Over the last decade or so the world has witnessed an explosion of great music, great movies and great games.<br /><br />In a world of great movies, one thing is constant - we love movies that make us laugh. And, in a world of great games, one thing is constant - we love games that are challenging and fun. Over the last few years, two great games have been released that I consider to be the best games ever, despite the fact that they are very different.<br /><br />Grand Theft Auto 3 is a great game, and one of the best games ever released. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a great game, and one of the best games ever released.<br /><br />So, which game wins? In my opinion, the game that wins is Grand Theft Auto 3 - it is the better game. The reason for this? In Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you get to run around and shoot at people. In Grand Theft Auto 3, you actually have to get a job and work for a living. The car missions are fun, but in the end, they are just a distraction.<br /><br />What sets Grand Theft Auto 3 apart from GTA San Andreas is that
 I have seen all of this movie several times and I can't believe that this has been released. First of all, the acting is atrocious and the dialog is even worse. I was hoping that this would be an action-packed ride and it wasn't. To make matters worse, they had a real good cast of actors in this movie (like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tony Todd and Krysta Rodriguez) and they never appear in the movie. I would not recommend this to anyone.

The other DVD that I bought from the same seller, "The Night Watchmen", and that is horrible as well. The dialog is bad and the acting is even worse. I have tried to see if you can find any other DVD of this movie, but I have not found one.

Stay away from these movies.

 This is a mediocre FMV horror film. The only real plus is the originality of the story. The gore is surprisingly well done for a video game. There are some decent deaths, but the rest of the film is just blah.

The acting is pretty bad. The main character is a bland, boring guy who is smart enough to run away from the monsters, but stupid enough to keep throwing himself at them. The vampire is underwritten. They took a good idea and then failed to flesh it out well. The only character who seems to have a good deal of depth is the game-addict girl. She's a weird girl, but she's interesting. She's a gamer, but she seems to have more depth than the other characters.

The music is mostly bad. They use a lot of the same overused techno theme music. They use it in a few scenes, and then they don't use it for a scene for a while. It's lame. The sound effects are pretty bad. They make a lot of the monsters sound like they're trying to eat people.

The cinematography is pretty bad, especially for a horror movie. The camera work is just awful.

The acting
 I have a distinct memory of watching this movie on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 TV show, and the episode didn't even get to the good part. I remember that one of the robots was the most stupid one ever be made (even the movie's director seemed to agree, since he completely avoided such robots in his later films), and that the movie's climax was just a sequence of auto-wrecks. I remember that I saw a clip of this movie on the MST3K episode, and was amazed at how bad it was. It was so bad that it actually made me laugh out loud (not something I do often!). I remember that I also tried to rent the movie by myself, but it was too bad to see in a theater, so I tried to buy it, but I couldn't find it anywhere. The movie was so bad that it has a special place in my heart. <br /><br />The movie is bad because it makes the viewer feel bad. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to throw up on yourself after you watch it. It's not a movie that you just sit back and let yourself be entertained by. It's a movie that tries to make you feel bad,
 This movie was a big flop at the box office and it was because of the fact that the director didn't know what to do with the script. The movie focuses on a bunch of guys who are all older than their teenage years who are unjustly accused of a crime and have to go to prison. The story is told in a very unique way but never really get's off the ground. You'll always wonder, who did it and how did they get away with it? The ending is also very disappointing and it just leaves you feeling like there were two movies in one. The acting was very good and it's a shame that the director didn't get any set up before. The movie has a lot more interesting components then this and it's a shame to see such a big, big flop at the box office. I wish the director would have stayed away from this script, a lot of people lose money with ideas like this.

Overrated, Overpraised and Overrated.



The movie
 The movie is based on a true story. That's it. A weak story with a few good scenes. The story is all about a group of people that have to sleep in a house that is haunted. The problem is that the film makers didn't deliver the goods in some scenes. The story is not scary and you won't be scared after watching the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing a movie that is based on a true story. If you are looking for a scary movie you can go see another one. If you are looking for a good film, you can go see "The Exorcism of Emily Rose".

I have seen films in the past that could have been better, but this one is just plain boring. There is not much to say about it.

I'm an adult and I don't like watching films that are based on true stories. I did not like this film.

 A film about a group of friends who find a single white hair in the comb of a black one, leading to a murder. The plot is based on the 1970 Italian film "Death by Hair" but weakens the original's narrative by forcing the friends to do a lot of running around. The film's only saving grace is a witty script that often makes us laugh. The acting is very poor (also the case of "Death by Hair") and the music is a bit lame. The only emotionless character among the main cast is the main killer, who is played by the talented Udo Kier. The film is not one of the worst films ever made, but it is very mediocre.

 I don't know why I bothered to watch this film. It was not only boring, but it was also very badly produced. I wouldn't even give it one star if I could. The main actor was so bad that I couldn't take it. He made a fool of himself and I'm sure the director did the same. The house they filmed in was a huge disappointment. I really don't know why they shot it in that house as it was so big it looked as if a huge man was living in it. The garden was also very small. I would have thought that they would have shot it somewhere more appealing or at least a bit bigger. If I had known this film was going to be this boring then I would have given it 0 stars.

 It was like a "live" TV show, only they didn't do it live. I just wanted to see what it looked like, but I was disappointed. It was the kind of show that you watch rather than the kind of show you watch. I'm sure it's good for the kids, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it.

 I don't believe I've ever seen a film that is so bad in all aspects of the movie-making process. I realize that this site is geared toward horror films, and that this is a horror film, but it is the WORST horror film I have ever seen. The acting, especially the lead, is the worst I've ever seen, and I'm pretty sure I've seen a lot of bad movies. The "romance" is totally unrealistic, and the acting is so bad that I didn't even feel bad enough to laugh, which is probably the only good thing about this movie. The "plot" is just not there, and doesn't make sense at all. Like I said, it's probably the worst I've ever seen. I've seen some good horror films, but this is right up there with the worst. That being said, I'll probably rent it again, but I'm never going to buy it. This was a total waste of my time, and I don't recommend it to anyone. I wish I had the money to send it back, but I'm broke and have no way of returning it.

 I don't think I'm in a position to comment on any of the technical aspects of this film. However, I was struck with the overall attitude and attitude of the writers, producers and director. This movie seems to be a series of clichés and stereotypes. I think they did not care to create an original story line. Their only goal was to generate a lot of money. The acting was also very poor. I think the producers did not want to pay actors to work on this movie and give them a good part. All of the actors were trying to be funny. They all seemed to be trying to show how smart they were, by saying a lot of stupid stuff. I think the producers wanted to make a movie that people are not supposed to like, but instead people are supposed to be shocked by it. They did a good job and should be congratulated for getting this movie in theaters. But I think the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.

 The bonus features on this DVD are all pretty good.<br /><br />The only real problem with this DVD is the audio. It is so bad that you can't hear what is being said. One thing that is interesting about the bonus features is that the director, Joe D'Amato, does not mention the name of the actor who plays his son in the movie.<br /><br />The audio is so bad that it takes away from the movie itself. There are some scenes in which it is so bad that it is almost impossible to tell what is happening. If you can get past the audio, then this is a fun movie to watch. Not so fun if you can't hear the dialogue.

1.0 out of 5 stars Laughing at the Horror Format: DVD I am a huge fan of the film "ALEXANDER" (the original 1970's version), and any other horror movie by Joe D'Amato. But this is a terrible movie, with a very poor plot, and a very bad audio track. I've read that the director Joe D'Amato had to pay the actors to appear in this movie, and I can see why. The actors are the worst I've
 I watched this movie because I know the actor who plays the lead role, Nils Poppe. In Germany he is known as the 'Barry White of Germany', because he is a well respected singer and actor. I must say I was disappointed because I thought he would play a much more serious role. He is always seen as a cool, sophisticated and suave guy. This movie is not good. His character is much too shallow and has no depth. The plot is weak and I had to watch this movie many times. I am afraid it won't go down well in Germany. I think it was much better to have a good script and a good performance. But this movie is not worth a so-called cult movie.

 If you think the movie's title is supposed to refer to what happens in the movie, you are dead wrong. I would have to give it 1 star for the name alone. This movie was ridiculous and utterly worthless. The idea of a "horror" movie actually scares me more than the movie itself. I only watched it to see how bad it was and I don't regret it one bit. In fact, it makes me glad I didn't see it at the theater. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would rather watch a movie by a 10-year old than this. The acting was horrible, the plot was ridiculous and the special effects were the worst I've seen in a movie this year. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 0 was the fact that it was a horrible movie and I wanted to see it for the sole purpose of giving it a 0.

 This movie should have been called "Revenge of the Fanged Monster: The Movie". I loved this movie. It had everything I wanted. It was funny, smart, campy and gory. I love how they make the Shaft movies even better than the original. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't throw at least one good old fashioned Shaft knife fight in the film. I hope that they make a sequel and bring back the classic "Shaft" feel.

 I saw this movie at a late night theater and I have to say that I was very disappointed. I have seen some of the worse movies ever made and this one was right up there. It was so bad that I actually went to the ticket booth and told them what I thought of it and they didn't even care.<br /><br />This movie is a very long and drawn out film that is supposed to be a thriller but it's hardly a thriller. The acting is pathetic and the plot is terrible. The only good part of this movie is that it has a few good scenes of violence.<br /><br />I strongly suggest "The Guardian" over this film. This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

 I saw this movie in my high school gym, on a Saturday afternoon. My friend and I had planned to watch the hell out of it, but we were both so disappointed by it. The movie and the people were so... so... shallow. I mean, they were so generic and stupid. I can't even begin to tell you guys how many times this movie came on, and I just kept turning it off. I mean, the plot was nothing special, and the characters were so stereotypical and boring. I was so unsatisfied with this movie and I'm sure you guys are too. Trust me, I'm a fan of the horror genre, and I know what I'm talking about (being an actress, I have some skills). I don't know why this movie is so well known. I guess it's because it's a comedy, but it's not funny and it's not scary. In fact, it's just plain stupid. I know this movie's a comedy, but it's not funny. I really don't understand the love for this movie. I don't think I'll watch it again. I'd rather watch SHUTTER ISLAND. I'm kidding. I do love SHUTTER ISLAND,
 I am very disappointed in this movie. I really loved the TV series and decided to see the movie based on the casting. I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie has a little bit of dialog here and there but it's pretty much nothing but action here and there.

It was like the movie never was meant to be. I do not recommend anyone seeing this movie.

 I'm old enough to remember the original "Planet of the Apes" when it first came out. I don't remember the movie fondly. I think I saw it once or twice on TV and remember that it was very well made. I was also very young at the time and may have been impressed by the inter-species romance between the human and the monkey. So I didn't think much of "Planet of the Apes" as a movie. I still don't think it's a particularly good movie. But I also didn't think it was awful, either. I just don't know how to approach it.<br /><br />"Battle for the Planet of the Apes" is even worse. Because it's not just badly made, it's not even well made. It doesn't have the budget to utilize special effects well. I mean, even "Gorillas in the Mist" had some good gorillas in it. The apes in "Battle for the Planet of the Apes" look like they're from a low-budget student film. One scene involves a gorilla playing a trumpet. I know that there's probably a legal reason for this, but it's still a really stupid scene.<br /
 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I recorded it and watched it about half a dozen times and still couldn't get through it. The dialog was horrible and the acting was beyond awful. I think the only good thing about it was the beautiful scenery.

I really think that the director, along with the actors, should be smacked.

(By the way, the title of the movie is misleading and should have been called "The Spoken Word".)

I thought that this movie was supposed to be about a woman who was touched by God to become a minister. I was wrong. The woman was supposed to be a minister, but the movie was so boring, I couldn't tell you anything about her.

I think the only good thing about it was the scenery.

If you want to waste your time and money on a truly boring movie, I recommend this movie.

Avoid this movie, it doesn't do it justice.

I'm glad I rented it, but I don't recommend it.

If you do watch it, it's a good thing if you don't want to sleep for a whole week after you finish it.


 I think I'm going to be sick. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the book and I was so excited when I heard there was going to be a movie. I have been in the process of trying to find someone to watch it with me so I could have someone to talk to about it, but I couldn't find anyone. I really don't know what to say about this movie. The acting was bad, the director and the crew were too lazy to even care about doing what they were supposed to do, the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was absolutely horrible. I think the only thing I can say about this movie is that it's better than a G rating. The only thing this movie had going for it was that it was a very quick story and it was all over in an hour and a half. I would never ever ever recommend this movie to anyone, and I would think twice before ever watching it. I just hope that whoever did this didn't make any money off of it.

 I saw this movie some time ago and can't recall the story line but I remember being very disappointed in this movie. There was no story line and even many of the characters were left unexplained. I was also disappointed in the actors and actresses. I was hoping for something better for this movie.

I don't recall any of the actors or actresses names but i think that the main character was a man who was part of a group of people who were trying to find their true selves. They were trying to find out who they were and what they were supposed to do with their lives as they came of age. I don't even know if he was played by a male or a female but one of the main characters was played by a black woman. I wish I could recall the name of the actress. I am sure it wasn't the actress I remembered but I'm afraid I don't remember her name.

I think this movie is best forgotten. I don't think I will ever watch it again. It was not very good.

Overall I would give this movie a 3 out of 10.

I wish I could remember the name of the actress but I can't. I have to say that it's just
 I've always had a fascination with The Twilight Zone, and I really wanted to like this movie. It has a great line-up of stars, and it's a very interesting premise. But, it's just not good. I don't even know where to start. I could write a fairly long and detailed analysis of why the movie fails, but I'm not going to. I'll just say that there are a couple scenes that are just awful, and you won't even be able to finish watching the movie. It's really that bad.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the original Twilight Zone, I'd recommend you skip this one. I'd say you owe it to yourself to rent one of the older episodes of the show...there are several of them that rank with the best episodes of the franchise.

 This is the sort of thing that could be right up the alley of a film maker who wants to make some quick cash without too much effort. There are some interesting ideas in here, but they are done in a sloppy, half-assed fashion. The film is so hideously cut it's a wonder it plays at all. The dialog is so bad it's painful. The acting is about as good as you can expect for this sort of film. The plot is a little bit like a cross between "The Usual Suspects" and "The Sixth Sense". It was a little bit of a shame to see it all go to waste.

 I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I had heard so much about the movie and the book and was really looking forward to the film. I was really disappointed with the movie and I am still trying to figure out why it was so bad.<br /><br />The film was boring and the only thing exciting about it was the fact that the filming was done in a cave as the characters were in the cave. I have never seen a movie with this much dialogue and not enough action. The film would have definitely been better if the characters had been drawn in a more realistic way.<br /><br />The story was not very good and the acting was not very good. The only actor that was good was the director. The director was the main reason for the film, as he did a great job with the film. The director did a great job with the film and the way it was shot. The director did a great job with the film, but the film was not very good.

 I just finished watching this movie, and all I can say is, I don't understand how it got made in the first place. I'm a big fan of the original movie, and I thought this movie was horrible. First of all, the sexual scenes were way too long, they were just totally unnecessary. Then, the acting was awful. The only actors who were actually decent were the ones that played the dogs, the rest of them were horrible. The director and the screen writer obviously didn't care at all about the movie, and that's why it's so bad. I'm not going to go through the whole movie and talk about every scene and everything, because that would take way too long. The movie is just so bad. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it, because it's just so bad. I can't believe that a movie like this got made. I just hope that the makers of this movie have learned their lesson, and I hope that they never make another movie.

 When I read the summary on IMDb I thought it might be worth a watch. Well, I'm glad I waited and watched it. The movie is so boring, slowly moving and the actors are boring too. A boring and slow movie. I have to admit, I was hoping the movie would have a bit more action in it. But it didn't. I hated the ending. It was really bad. I mean I've seen worse movies but this one had a really bad ending. It's not worth watching it. <br /><br />I thought this movie was about a guy who became a vampire. I mean it did say Vampire on the cover. But it wasn't. It was about a guy who becomes a vampire hunter. The movie is about the vampire hunter turning into a vampire. I don't understand why the vampire hunter had to turn into a vampire. It did say vampire hunter, not vampire hunter vampire. The ending was so bad. I felt like I was watching a bad horror movie. I don't know why the director already decided to make it a vampire movie. I would have left at the beginning.

I give it 2 out of 10. If you have time, wait for it to be
 The first and best movie from the master of the wacky, the wonderful, and the completely useless. The plot is simple but the execution is ridiculous. The two main characters are two very strong, very likable actors who can make a movie even when it isn't very good. And their chemistry is flawless. But the rest of the cast is pretty much the worst you could imagine. The bad guy is a weird, psycho-hag and the cops are the worst, most annoying cops ever in a movie. The movie is just so unbelievably bad that it's awesome. And it's got lots of great, silly dialogue and some really awesome, memorable scenes. It's really entertaining. If you're a fan of the guy, or if you want to watch some really bad, silly and entertaining movie, this is the movie for you.

 In a way, I'm sorry I rented this. It's not that it's a bad movie -- far from it -- it's just that it's so painfully dull. I went into the theater expecting to have fun watching a movie about a bunch of youngsters who wake up one day and find they have superpowers, but the lack of humor and the flat, uninspired dialogue made it a very difficult watch.<br /><br />My advice: Skip this one.

 I did not know that this movie was remade in Hindi as "Bhootnath" a few years ago. When I saw the trailer, I was a little skeptical, but watching it, I was surprised that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought. I still think it's a bad movie, but it's not nearly as terrible as I thought it would be. The remake was much worse. But as I read that the original was made in the 60's, I do wonder if it was made then and not released, or if it was made in the 70's, it was released then and then got remade in Hindi. I don't know if the remake was released, but I expect it was, because then it would be on the internet. I do know the original was not released, so I think it was made in the 60's. I hope this helps, at least it is real. I have seen a review that says the original was made in the 70's and was released in the 80's. I do not know if that is true, because I did not see the 80's remake. That's why I'm writing this. I would like to know.

Well, the
 I saw this movie in the video store when I was a kid. I think it was the only movie I saw that I didn't like. I think it was because I didn't like the kids. I thought they were just too "girly" for me. I was right, I didn't like the kids. I don't like them now either. The main character was a middle school kid who had an imaginary friend who wasn't little like the G in the G-men. I didn't like that. I also don't like the aliens. Not because of the aliens, I just don't like them. I think the movie was way too long. It was about 2 hours. I think it could have been about 45 minutes which would have made it a lot more enjoyable. I guess that was the big problem with the movie to me. The aliens seemed really stupid to me. I know the director did a great job here, he did a lot of movies. But I think it was just a bad movie. But I still like the director. I think he did a great job with the movie. I just didn't like the movie. I don't think it's a bad movie. I just think it was
 I saw this movie last night at the local theater and I have to admit I was disappointed. I have read the book a million times and I was expecting a very different movie. It seemed as if this movie did a very bad job of transferring the book to the screen. I also didn't understand why they changed the ending of the book. I understand it was just to make it more exciting but it just didn't make sense to me. And I didn't understand the ending of the movie, it seemed as if they were trying to send a message or something but I didn't get it. I thought the acting was good but the movie just seemed as if they needed to do a lot more research on the book and the movie just didn't do well. I also didn't like the fact that they kept changing the point of view (viewer) and I don't think it was necessary to do that. I didn't like the music at all and I thought it was out of place. I have to say I was very disappointed in the movie.

My favorite part of the book is the love scene and the last part of the book but I was very disappointed in the movie. If I could take it back I would,
 I don't normally write a review, but I was so disappointed with this film that I felt compelled. I was quite frankly hoping for a film that would be entertaining and entertaining it was not. What we got was a film that seemed to be made by someone who had never seen a film before. In fact the plot made no sense at all, nor did the characters. The plot was a series of events in which the film just led one to believe that the plot was going somewhere then just stopped and the film was over. It is obvious that the writer had no concept of a story line and this film is evidence of that. The film is made up of 3 stories, which are all connected with the death of a man, who died after his wife left him. The film is also about a woman who is making a documentary about the man when she discovers that he is an old flame of hers, (who has not really died). Then there is a story about a prostitute and a police officer who arrives at the clubs to arrest the prostitute, then lets her go. This film is so poorly made that the only thing that makes it watchable is the nudity. That and the fact that it might startle you to see a woman with
 I will not even get started about this movie. This movie is a worst movie ever and I bet all the people who made this movie will go to hell for ruining such a good idea. This is the worst disgusting looking movie ever. The only good thing is that the movie starts at the end, so if you are a fan of the original movie and don't want to see the horrible looking remake, you can stop after you see the original movie. But I guess the producers of this movie will be happy if you see it. This movie is so bad that I can't even say anything about it. The acting is horrible, the song is horrible, the story is horrible and the makeup is horrible. This movie is just horrible. I wonder if it was ever made. I mean, I don't think so. I bet all the people who made this movie will go to hell, because they are just horrible people. I don't know why they even made this movie. I wish that I can go to hell, because I know all the people who made this movie will. I hope that all the people who made this movie are rotting in hell.

0/10, don't even waste your time.

 I've seen this movie many times and it's just as bad every time. I can't believe people are talking about it like it was really good. It's not, it's a bore. The acting is horrible, the story is boring, the dialogue is bad, the directing is bad and the effects are bad. It's just a waste of 2 hours of your life. It's not even worth renting. It's just as bad as all the bad movies of the 80's.

I know it's old, but I'm sure there are better movies from that era you could watch. I have seen better movies from the 70's and 80's. The entire movie is just boring. This movie has no point, no meaning and no story. The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it is over with.

I have seen better movies from the 70's and 80's. This movie is just as bad as all the bad movies of the 80's. It should've been left in the 80's.

 I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, but it couldn't hold up to the hype.<br /><br />It's a good thing I was able to watch it in small chunks, because the unintentional humor was so bad and so frequent, I was driven to distraction.<br /><br />The characters are all clichés, the dialogue is below average, and the story is predictable. The only thing that saves it is the special effects; they're nothing too special, but at least they were original.<br /><br />It was fun to watch, but I couldn't give it a better rating than 1/2.

I had to see this in the theaters when I saw it, I was so excited. I had seen the commercials and trailers and was very excited to see this movie. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. It was a lot of fun, but also a lot of funny scenes that made me laugh out loud. It was a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie,
 I saw this movie when it came out and thought it was a pretty good movie. However, seeing it again recently, I realized how poorly the movie was made. It just seemed like a bunch of misfit kids on a camping trip that got mixed up with a bunch of horny frat boys. I think the plot was there, but it was just poorly executed. There was no real plot. At least, not one that you would expect from a movie like this. There were a few funny moments, but they were few and far between. Bottom line is, if you like this kind of humor, you will probably like this movie. If you are looking for a good plot and good acting, then you will probably be disappointed.

1 (out of 10) Panic! At The Disco

6/10

In Panic! At The Disco, the band is going to be playing at a club in Hollywood. However, they get there and it is not the club they were supposed to play. They have to play a cover of a song at the club, but they don't have the rights to do that. They end up at a hotel, where they have to play a song that wasn't written especially for the
 I watched this movie about 8 years ago, and it really didn't do much for me. After reading all of the good reviews here, I decided to watch it again. The acting was mediocre, the story line was not even close to believable, and it was very boring. It's one of those movies that you can't wait until it's over to get through it. If you are looking for a movie that has a plot that is believable, and interesting, you'll be disappointed. The ending was predictable, and the movie, although rated PG, does not really have anything PG about it.

I guess in an attempt to be funny, the director decided that a clown would make a better hero than a police officer.<br /><br />I would almost rather watch a few minutes of a commercial than endure boredom and sappy music and acting on this movie.

9 out of 10, but I give it a 3 out of 10.

** Question** Was the movie originally called "The Clown" or did the name change somewhere along the line?

***Answer*** The movie was originally called "The Clown." In the late 80's a company called Millenium Films purchased the rights to the movie,
 I'm going to keep this short and sweet, because I've already written a review on IMDb and I don't want to write another one. This is a very bad film. Unless you are interested in seeing how bad a film can be, I would suggest that you stay away from this one. The plot is thin, and the acting is even thinner. The direction is a joke. The editing is atrocious. I've seen better editing in an episode of "The A-Team". That's not even a low bar, that's something that would get a laugh in a comedy. In a drama? It gets a laugh? Seriously? The plot is thin, the directing is atrocious, the editing is atrocious, the acting is atrocious... I don't even think I have to say anything else. If you're looking for a good bad film, you'll find something better. I'd even go so far as to say that this film is probably the worst film I've ever seen.

 "Café Society" is a slow-paced, maudlin and pretentious film that wastes a talented cast.<br /><br />The film is about a young man who sees his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) at a café. In order to be with her, he moves to New York to work as a waiter in her family's café. He becomes a cavalier and she falls in love with him. The film is about his relationship with his family, his girlfriend and his dreams. The film is shot in black and white and uses interesting film techniques to show the developing relationship between the lead characters.<br /><br />The film is a dull, slow and pretentious film that is unable to engage the audience. The film is about aspiring actors, about love and about the problems the young man has in his relationship with his girlfriend. The film is about the relationship between the two characters, the problems each has and the way the relationship changes. The film is about a young man who is stuck in his life and wants to escape, but can't.<br /><br />The film has some interesting moments, but the film is too slow and repetitive to be engaging.

 This show was pretty crappy. It was not even worth watching in the first place. It was a comedy but it was absolutely not funny at all. I cannot believe that any person would waste their time on this horrible show. It was just a bunch of idiots that did nothing but talk about how great they were.

 I was floored. I saw this at a theater in the 60's and I felt like a kid again. I'm not sure if it was the "good old days" or not, but I could not believe what I saw. I was that kid again. I wanted to jump in the screen and go to the moon. I could not believe that I was watching this. I was sure that it had to have been done as a spoof or something. It was just not believable at all. I was struck by the fact that this was made in 1968. I could not believe that this was made in 1968. The costumes were ridiculous and the sets were laughable, but the actors were out of this world. I've never seen such incredible acting in a movie. I'm not sure if this movie is "good" or not, but it is certainly "bad". A movie that you have to see at least once.

This is a movie that you have to see once.

Plot
 Well I guess I should warn you that with this movie you can't take it too seriously. The writing is so-so and the acting is almost non-existent. The plot is a little thin and the story is definitely not very good. The film has some funny moments, but its not a must see. I'm not sure why this movie is so widely distributed and sold to the public. If your looking for a good movie to watch with friends, this is not the film for you. I think the movie title is misleading, because it really isn't a horror movie. I think the title "The Haunted House" sounds more dramatic. Overall I would give this movie a 2/10. I give it a 2 because it was funny at times.

Rating of 2/10

The film begins with a woman (I didn't even bother to look her up). She is in a rock band and they are playing at the local bar. The bar is a rundown bar, so it seems like a good place to have a little fun. Suddenly the whole place starts shaking. The band stops playing and the woman starts to freak out. Everyone is freaking out and nobody knows what is going on. They are all in a
 My rating is based on personal preference. I didn't find a lot to like in this movie. I have to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie are very effective and the camera work is beautiful. That's where the movie gets me interested. Maybe this kind of movie is a good idea for someone else but not for me. Maybe I just expected too much from it. Maybe I should have liked it more if I hadn't seen it. Maybe if I had seen it after the end of the Cold War I would have liked it more. Maybe it is just a bad movie. I don't know. I'm not sure I want to know.

I watched this movie with a friend of mine who really enjoyed it. He said he enjoyed it more than the first Highlander. He said it was more about the characters than about the plot. That's true for me, too. But I didn't like the characters any better. I didn't like them any worse, either. I just didn't like them as much as I didn't like the plot.

I don't like the way the movie starts. The first couple of minutes are very good, but after that it goes downhill. The whole movie is
 I've seen this movie twice. I'm not sure if I'm going to watch it again. I don't know what to think of it. I know that the acting was good, but the story was strange, and I didn't care about any of the characters. I would have to say that this was my least favorite movie of the year. The most important thing about a movie is that you have to care about the characters involved. I didn't care about any of them. The story was confusing and I didn't get it. Is this a horror movie? I didn't get it at all. I don't understand why the characters in this movie would go to a castle. It just didn't seem like it would be a good idea. Some of the scenes in the castle were really creepy, especially the one with the twin girls. I don't know what to think of this movie. I don't think that anyone should watch it. I don't think that it is scary or suspenseful in any way. I don't think that it has any suspense or scares. I'm going to give this movie a 2/10. If you want to watch something scary and suspenseful, watch "The Skeleton Key."

 There are a lot of television movies that were not made for the movies but for the TV. They were made to fill the time until the next season of a series or a special. Movies like "The Fugitive" and "The Six Million Dollar Man" are great examples of that. "The In-Laws" is another. I do not know if the film was made with the expectation of series or special but I do know that the movie is worth watching for the cast alone. It is a comedy and I like comedies. It is also a great thriller. It does not have much in the way of plot but the cast make up for that. The movie was made in the mid-1980's but is still relevant today because of the cast. Walter Matthau and Peter Falk are great as the married couple to be. They do not get along but they are great together. The rest of the cast is just as good. Fabian is great as a young man who thinks he knows everything. He is not afraid to speak his mind. He has a lot of good lines. The movie also has some good music by Randy Newman. It is a good movie but it is not great. It is a movie that is worth
 I was really shocked when I watched this movie, it was so bad I literally wanted to leave. I mean, I'm a huge fan of the characters and of this series, and this movie is just so awful, it's not even funny. I'm going to use the word bad but I guess it could have been worse. I've heard other people say that the movie is "bad" but that it's just a "kids movie", I don't agree with this. As a kid, I can tell you that this was just a bad movie. I mean, it has nothing to do with the story, it's just boring and stupid. I saw this movie when I was twelve, and to this day I still remember the worst part of it: the scene where the kids use the trampoline to fly! I know that's not the point of the movie (it's about BMXs and of course the characters!) but the fact that I would have to see a BMX movie with a scene like that in it... well, it's just horrible. When I saw that scene I just thought "what's going on here? This isn't a BMX movie, it's a kids movie that's about BM
 This movie is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. It's the kind of movie that you can't even make fun of, because it's so bad. It's not even a good bad movie. It's just a very bland, boring movie. The only positive thing I can say about it is that the acting was actually decent and the cinematography was pretty good. But it's not enough to save the movie. The story is so boring that the only thing people will remember it for is the fact that it stars Chevy Chase, who is one of the worst actors ever. I can't even explain what the movie is about, but let me try to sum it up in a way that you may be able to understand it. The story is about a pizza guy who is obsessed with his best friend's sister (Jennifer Aniston), and a cop who is obsessed with Wade (Billy Bob Thornton). The basic plot is that they both like the same girl, but they can't get her, so they both try to win her over. It's basically a stupid, boring, and pointless story. The only reason you would want to see this is if you're into Chevy Chase. I always thought Chevy Chase was a bad actor,
 This movie is a complete waste of time, it's totally absurd and stupid. The plot is so far-fetched that it's more like a parody than a movie. It's supposed to be a comedy but it's really just a sad excuse to see naked women. I'm not saying that the naked women are not beautiful but they are so ugly it's unbelievable. If you want to see a good movie that jokes about sex go to "The Producers". If you want to see a movie that makes fun of sex go see "The 40 year old Virgin". If you want to see a good movie with hot chicks in it go see "10". And if you're looking for a complete waste of time to enjoy watching naked women go see "The 40 year old Virgin".

<br /><br />I have to say that I am not a fan of "The 40 year old Virgin". I find it to be a complete waste of time. The plot is so far off that it is totally ridiculous.

 After the early 1970s, when the world was getting to grips with the concept of international terrorism and how the US was involved with it, one of the biggest TV series of the decade was ER. ER was a show about the staff at a hospital in Chicago, and it was basically a soap with a bit of a medical twist. It was basically a soap with a bit of a medical twist. It was a hit, and was seen all over the world, and people started to copy the show. While many of the early shows were pretty good, the quality started to drop with the next generation of hospital shows. <br /><br />ER was basically set in a hospital, but it was set in a hospital in Chicago. It didn't go into too much detail about the hospital and the staff, but it was basically a soap with a medical twist. The show's concept was pretty good, it was basically a hospital where lots of people died and lots of people got injured. The characters got to grips with lots of medical problems and dealt with them, but the quality of the show stayed pretty high, and ER was one of the best shows on TV for a very long time. However, after the first few years of ER,
 This is not a movie, it is a video. First, the acting was awful. Good actors could not have been casted to do any justice to this movie. The plot is absurd, the characters are completely unbelievable, and the director is a hack. I have never been so insulted and disappointed by a movie before. This is not a movie, it is a video.

 I was very excited to see this film but I have to say I was let down by it. I had heard some good things about this film and i was hoping for a good and entertaining flick but sadly it was just a blah blah blah film. I know that I am in the minority in saying this but I just didn't get it. I didn't like any of the characters. Cloris Leachman as a southern woman is OK but what was the point of her character? I don't understand her motivation and it was a bit of a let down. She was just a stereotypical jokey southern woman and I didn't like that. The only good thing about this film was the writing in the first two acts. I wish the film had stuck to this for the whole film because the jokes are really good and the dialog was also good. As for the rest of the film it is just a film that I just couldn't get into. I am sure that if it had been a film about a man and his family and the same jokes about women being stupid and that type of thing then it would have been a better film but unfortunately it was not. I have seen worse films but this just wasn't one of them.


 I really wanted to like this movie. I was really hoping for a "lost clip" on the DVD of the original series. It's a shame that the producers were so anxious to make this movie, when they could have been making the TV movies from the original series. The story is great, the special effects are impressive, and the actors make the movie watchable. The problem is that the filmmakers wanted to make a movie that would appeal to the fans of the original series. And the fans of the original series want to see the original series. The producers fell in love with a few of the actors, and cast them so that they would be able to work their contracted numbers of episodes. The problem is that these actors can't carry a movie by themselves, and they don't. Their characters are not interesting enough to carry a movie on their own, but when they are paired with the original series actors, they become interesting. And in this movie, they get to work with the original series actors. So, the movie works well if you are a fan of the original series, but if you are not, it just doesn't work.

P.S. I really liked the original
 The writing and acting isn't that bad, but the film's concept is pretty stupid. There's a reason why most of these types of movies are made in the first place: because the people who made them are clueless. The movie itself is pretty much what you'd expect from a film like this. There's no originality, no depth, and no real story.<br /><br />I've seen better things out there, but I did enjoy the fact that this movie fails so horribly at everything it attempts to do. I've heard of movies that try to make a point, but this one tries to do it without making you think. I don't know if it was the poor writing or the poor direction, but it just seems like the director had a garage full of ideas and no budget to go with them.<br /><br />I want to say that they at least tried to make this movie, but the fact is that they didn't. This is a movie made by morons and for morons.

P.S. - I'm not a fan of the music, either.

 I was waiting for someone to invent the "Good Guy" or "Bad Guy" for this movie. I didn't find it. They are too inconsistent. The only guy I can see being the bad guy is the guy with the golden heart, the man with the golden heart. As for the good guys, well, one was a good guy because he was a cop. The other was a good guy because he was kind to the old lady. <br /><br />I looked for some humor in this movie. I didn't find it. I looked for some plot in this movie. I didn't find it. I looked for some plot twists in this movie. I didn't find them. I looked for some suspense in this movie. I didn't find it. I saw some guts in this movie. I didn't see any. I saw some action in this movie. I didn't see any. I looked for lots of blood and gore in this movie. I didn't see any. I looked for lots of violence in this movie. I didn't see any. I looked for an evil laugh in this movie. I didn't see one.<br /><br />There are some good things about this movie.
 This is the absolute worst horror film I've ever seen. A complete waste of time. I've seen a lot of horrible things to waste time, but this is over the top. The acting is horrible, the camera work is terrible, the story is ridiculous and the low budget is so apparent that it's laughable. I'm not sure what the producers were thinking when they made this, but I'm sure it was a very stupid idea. If you manage to sit through this, it's your own fault.

 This is a movie that I have seen several times and each time I have the same reaction. I have to give it credit, the film is well made and well acted, however, the story is so ridiculous that it is hard to take seriously. For instance, I was sitting next to my wife while watching and she is a film major and I am a film student. We both agreed that there was one scene in which the hero's wife played by Hedy Lamarr is supposed to be giving birth. So she is giving birth to a baby that is about to be born and she is giving birth to the kid and it is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
 This is a piece of crap. The script is weak and the acting is worse. The over all budget must have been very low. The only good thing about this film is the locations. The whole movie is just bad.

2/10

***SPOILERS***

I know this is a bad movie. I am giving it a 1 because it has some good ideas. The scripts idea is that the two scientists are going to build a time machine. A time machine that takes people back in time. This movie has a very slow pace. The acting is bad and the script is weak. The acting is very flat and the script is weak. The movie has some good ideas and some good locations.

1/10

The directing is bad. There is no flow to the movie. The directing is very bad.

1/10

The filming is bad. The camera work is horrible and the lighting is bad.

1/10

The editing is very bad. The editing makes the movie seem like it is going somewhere but the movie really doesn't. There is nothing really good about this movie. The editing is so bad that I am shocked that it wasn't worse.
 This film is a work of pure art. I can't believe people call this film low rent, I'd hate to think what people consider high art. This film is a masterpiece, it's perfect in every way, I don't know how anyone could hate it. I can't believe how stupid people are, I mean, how can you sit through this movie and think it's any good? It's not a great movie, but it's not bad, it's not good, it's just pure art. The acting is top notch, the story is perfect, the music is wonderful and the visuals are earth shattering. This film is the best pure art film I've ever seen, it's just pure genius. I don't know why people hate it, its just so wonderful!

If you are one of those people who hates this film, I urge you to reconsider, really reconsider. You can hate this film, but you can't hate it. I don't know what to say to these people, there is no way to explain the beauty of this movie. It's just so perfect that it's not even funny. This is the best movie I have ever seen, the way this movie makes me feel, it's
 So I went to see this film thinking it would be like the Star Wars prequel movie. I was wrong. The story line is really really really really really bad. The special effects and acting was really bad. The main character Clayton is a good example of how they could have done it better. He is the only one that is really acting like he was in a Star Wars movie. He is the only one that didn't say the stupid stuff that Lucas made the characters say. The director and screen writers should have known better. Lucas should have known better. The actors like Chris Evans were good. Chris Evans is a good actor. Chris Evans is a great actor. The other actors were not. No offense to the other actors. But it is true. Overall I would rather watch the Star Wars prequel movie then this. I can go on for days about the things that I didn't like about this movie. I think the only reason why I watched it was because I am a huge fan of Star Wars. I'm not a fan of the new Star Wars movies. And all the Star Wars fans are going to love this movie. The first Star Wars movie was a flop and now this. But I still like to watch it
 This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is better than most of the trash I see on TV these days, but shouldn't have been made. It's not even that the plot is so stupid; it's that the plot is so poorly executed. The first problem is that the plot has no real ending. It seems like the writers were so concerned with getting all the clichés of a good slasher film into the plot that they failed to think up a good plot that would make this a good film. Of course, you won't know this until you've seen the film. The dialogue is atrocious and the acting is so bad it's almost hilarious. The only actor who really does a good job is the one who played the killer. Well, maybe one. In fact, there are several people who did a good job, but they seem to have been forgotten and replaced with the others. All in all, this film is just not good. The plot is bad, the acting is bad, the editing is bad, and the effects are bad. I mean, really bad. There's nothing good about this film.

*Possible Spoilers*

The only good thing about this film
 This film started off well with a nice little opening sequence, but then the film started going downhill. The acting was terrible, the special effects were unbelievable, the story got boring and the ending was absurd and over the top. This was one of my worst film experiences.

I'm giving it a 1 because I'm being generous, but I'm a big fan of this director. This was just a bad movie. There was nothing redeeming about it. The only thing I can figure is that it was made quickly and cheaply.

This is a lesson to all filmmakers. If you want to make a good movie, you will have to work on it for a long, long time. If you can't cut it in four months, then don't try to make a movie.

 I found this film to be very disappointing. The plot was very simple and the acting was extremely amateurish. The film is also very slow, boring and I found it very hard to get through. The film really drags on and has no real intensity which I was expecting from a film about the mafia. The directors do not have a clear idea of what they want to say. This is a film that will not leave any lasting impression, unless you are a massive fan of the genre. The film is also very cheesy and a lot of the murders are totally out of context and just ridiculous. I would not recommend this film to a friend.

 I have to say I am a huge fan of the original "Ghostbusters" movie. I thought the remake was a terrible disappointment. I did however watch the first half of this film and I have to say it was surprisingly good. I don't know what happened in the second half but this movie just turned into a giant clusterf**k. There are some parts that are actually funny (like the part where they take the test at the beginning) but most of the movie is just bad. I can't believe the director didn't realize that the main character killing himself was a huge plot point. The special effects are terrible, of course they probably are since they're the same ones that were used in the original film. But still they're not enough to save the movie. I know that's not the point of the movie but I feel like the second half is unnecessary and I just don't care about the characters anymore. I'm sure there are a bunch of kids out there who will like this movie and it's probably a better movie for them. I just think it's a bad movie for anyone else.

<br /><br />Overall: 2/10<br /><br />***spoilers***<
 The only reason I watched this movie is because it was an "American" film, and I was interested. But it was so bad, I actually thought it was a made-for-TV movie. The acting was very bad, the plot was very bad, the effects were very bad, the script was very bad, and the story line was very bad. The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it was made in the U.S.A. I would give it a zero.

*** This review may contain spoilers *** I'd like to just say that I would never have thought that a movie could be so bad. I mean, I knew it was going to be bad, but I didn't think it would actually be so bad. This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen some really bad movies. The acting was very bad, the plot was very bad, the effects were very bad, the script was very bad, and the story line was very bad. I'd give it a zero out of 10.

 This movie is about a girl who gets lost in a magic forest. She is rescued by a forest creature (Crocodile Man), who takes her to his home which is a castle in the middle of the forest. She soon becomes a bride of Crocodile Man. The only problem is, she is not able to make him happy. She does everything she can to please him and she does, but it doesn't seem to do anything for him. She soon finds out that Crocodile Man is a man in a costume, which is why he doesn't want to touch her. Then, one night, some people show up in the forest and they're looking for Crocodile Man. Crocodile Man tries to protect his bride, but he ends up being captured. He is taken to the evil Captain and his evil crew. They take him to their evil ship, where they cast a spell on him and turn him into a human. He becomes a human and he has to look after his bride. I don't understand why they didn't cast a spell on her or why she didn't have to become a human. They were both in danger, so why not just make her a human? Anyway, the bride and
 OK, this movie isn't as bad as I originally thought it would be. It isn't bad, it's just not very good. It's not a horror movie, it's just an extremely tame one. Sure, it has some scares, but you'll probably be crying like a baby before the end of the movie.<br /><br />The acting is pretty bad. It's not the worst acting I've seen, but it's certainly not the best.<br /><br />The storyline is also very boring. No real depth to it. You know what's going to happen, but you're still watching it.<br /><br />The acting is also very bad here, too. But it's at least not as bad as Catwoman, but it's still pretty bad.<br /><br />The whole movie is just very, very tame. I wouldn't even call this a movie, but rather a TV movie. And TV movies suck. This is one of them anyway.<br /><br />I gave this film 3 stars because I did end up watching it to the end, but I was very disappointed in it. I'd rather watch a movie with nudity, gore, and a story. This
 The original concept was really good: four superheroes who decide to go back to the Muggle world, while the wizarding world is being destroyed by the wizard who wants to be the most powerful. The problem was that the movie was not really good. The actors were not really good, the plot was not really good, the special effects were really bad, the script was really bad and the direction was really bad. Yes, I did watch it twice and I still can't believe that I did. And yes, I know that I am a Muggle. I know that you don't need to be a Muggle to understand that the movie was not good. I know that you can't judge a movie by how good (or bad) an actor is, how good (or bad) the special effects are, how good (or bad) the script is, or how good (or bad) the direction is. No, you can't be a good reviewer if you are not a good moviegoer. I know that. I also know that I am not a good moviegoer. So I went to see some movies that I really wanted to see. I saw "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and "
 Filmed in Tunisia, this movie is a remake of the popular French movie "The Blue Room", which itself was a remake of the 1934 version. The film's biggest draw is the strong performances of the leads: Swedish actress Malin Dahlström, who plays the part of Elvira, and Tunisian actor Radhouane Rached, who plays the part of Maurice. Malin Dahlström tells a very interesting story, but the way it is presented is the biggest problem.<br /><br />The story is about a woman named Elvira who has been married for years to an old man named Maurice. They have a son together (played by Radhouane Rached). The film begins with Elvira being seduced by her friend, who is also married. This friend is played by the Tunisian actress Salwa Ben Ammar, who was very beautiful but not especially good at acting. After this scene, the film flashes back to Maurice's childhood. Maurice had a younger brother named Michel, who is a very good athlete. When Michel gets hit by a car, he dies, and this is when the film switches to the present day. The film goes back and forth between the past and the
 This is a real shocker. I have seen all of Howard Hawks' work in his lifetime, but this is the first time I have ever seen a movie that I was truly ashamed to have created. The plot is almost completely dependent on the audience believing that the story being told is a true story. The acting is universally awful and the plot is so contrived that it is unbelievable. The only good thing about this movie is that it is only 60 minutes long. I would strongly suggest that no one ever see this movie, save for the purpose of being entertained by the ridiculous nature of the plot.

The two main characters were both men who were determined to raise and protect their families. One was a veteran of WWII and the other was a young man who was just married. Both had a lot to loose in this movie and the plot was designed to let us know this. Both men were "good guys." Both men were willing to lay down their lives to keep their families safe. Both men were completely willing to give their lives to protect the other. Both men were honorable, brave and willing to sacrifice everything for their families. Both sets of children were also good guys and willing to sacrifice everything to
 I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I was really excited to see another Burt Reynolds movie. I was thinking "Wow, this is going to be good." I thought that it would be a good movie to see with some friends on a summer evening. I was wrong. The film was not very good at all. I found myself very annoyed. I was annoyed by the fact that there were so many stereotypes in this movie. I found it very annoying that the first time that Burt Reynolds was in a movie, he had to play a racist. I thought that it was very annoying that the other people that he was working with were all nincompoops. I found it especially annoying that there was a very strong stereotype that was projected by this movie. I found it very annoying that no woman was able to stand up for themselves or the situation that they were in. I found it very annoying that Burt Reynolds was the only person who was trying to stand up against these people. I found it very annoying that the only character in the movie that was successful, was a woman. I also found it very annoying that Burt Reynolds was the only one who was really trying to be a good guy. I found this movie to
 This film looks interesting and I am hoping that there is a better film hidden in all this mess. However, I have found many things to be completely wrong in this movie.<br /><br />First, the score. I like the fact that this is a score, rather than an action score. However, the premise of a score, is to add music to the action, not to stand alone. I think that this is a serious weak point. I understand that the director wanted to add music to the action, but the score sounds like it was written for a musical and not for a film.<br /><br />The acting is also very weak, although it's not bad by any means.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is interesting, but the weak score, and weak acting make the film very hard to watch. I think that this film could have been better, and would have been better if the director had taken some of the score out and had focused on the action, or on the music. I am undecided if I will ever watch this film again.

 I have seen many Elvis movies, most of them are good and some are bad. The King is dead is a bad movie. It starts out with a good story but is dull, boring and very confusing. The movie does not make any sense. You can tell that the story was written by someone who did not understand the Elvis story or was just trying to write a good story.<br /><br />The acting is not good. The casting is okay. I would have preferred to see some of the other Elvis movies. The soundtrack is okay. The still pictures are okay. The movie is okay.<br /><br />I rate this movie a 2.

I have seen a lot of Elvis movies and this one is one of the worst. I don't know why they made this movie. The story is boring and confusing. The acting is not the best and the songs are very boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

 The only reason I saw this was to see the beautiful and vivacious Tiffani Thiessen. She is a very good actress, but this is not one of her best films. She has a problem with people who are not all that nice, and the scriptwriters did not give her much to do. I feel the real Tiffani Thiessen was better in the movie "Friends" than this one. The movie did not have much action, and the action scenes were not all that exciting. The movie has a lot of sex, but not a lot of love scenes. The movie is not all that funny, and the laughs are not as good as they could have been. I feel the movie would have been better if it had been done for a TV movie, and not for a movie theater. I think the movie is one of the worst that Tiffani has been in. I would not recommend this for anyone.

Kevin McKidd is a good actor, and I think he does a good job in this movie. I think the rest of the cast does a good job as well. I think the movie could have been better, but I do not feel it was a complete waste of time.

 I'm going to give it to him for his acting, but for the story, it is a disgrace. I think my friend and I had better things to do than watch it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what he was thinking when he wrote the script, but it is not a total waste of time. It's funny and it has some good scenes. The biggest weakness is the story, which has a few highlights, but overall, it is not a good movie. It is a comedy, but it is not a "sit down and laugh at the funny parts" type comedy. I'm not sure what the intentions were, but I think the movie would have been better if the writer had focused on the comedy and not the story. I think the writer should have spent a little more time on the story and a little less time thinking up the "gags" in the script. <br /><br />If you want to watch a comedy, I would suggest something like "Swingers" or "The Wedding Singer." If you want to see a movie that is a little more thoughtful and better written, try "The Big Lebowski" or "Boogie Nights." You'd be better off watching
 I am a stickler for movies that actually take place in the real world. This film takes place in a really bizarre world. There is absolutely nothing about this movie that would make it seem realistic. Why would a man in the throws of a midlife crisis, break up with his girlfriend, move to New York, and then get randomly attacked by a real life, completely insane and totally unhinged man? What about the fact that this movie takes place in a city where people like to throw bottles at people and the police are simple a bunch of idiots that are not equipped to handle a situation like this? The more I think about this movie the more I think it was a sign of the times. The whole movie is nothing more than a metaphor for the problems of the city today. This is a movie that is fit for the most refined and sophisticated minds. It's a movie that is as laughable as it is pretentious.

It's my first time seeing this film. I will say that both the acting and the directing are subpar. I think that this movie was more of a failure than it was a success. I think that maybe the main reason that the film was a success at all is because the film was released
 ... well, I've been a fan of the series for quite a while, but it's a shame that this movie didn't make any sense at all. I was really disappointed in the fact that I was expecting a different movie after all the hype in the media and on this web site, but I was left highly disappointed. The whole plot was completely incomprehensible and there were so many things that didn't make sense. For example, when I saw a scene where Spock was looking at a plant and it appeared to be moving, I thought, "Cool, I never saw that before. Is this a time-travel thing?", but then I realized that he wasn't looking at a plant. What a shame, because the movie had some of the best moments in the series, especially when Spock was in the future and he was speaking with Dr. McCoy. I don't know why they had to ruin the movie with that stupid "time-travel" thing. I hope the next movie will be a lot better than this one. It's too bad that this movie didn't make any sense and I think that it would make a lot more sense if a lot of things were explained in the movie. I mean, you can't just try to
 When I first saw this movie I loved it, but I have to say that after watching it a few more times I'm not so impressed. The acting is terrible, the script is even worse, and the whole thing is just not that good. I found myself wondering if maybe the whole project was just a joke from the beginning, since it felt as if they were just having a good laugh at making a movie. Maybe they thought they were making a comedy. Maybe they thought they were making a movie.<br /><br />The result, however, is a movie that ends up being so inept that it's a chore to sit through. The story is weak, and the characters are even more so. The acting is not very good, the script is not very good, and the camera work is not very good. I didn't like it.

Not even a good comedy.

Author: Bill from Phoenix, AZ

I watched this movie three times and I just can't seem to get through it. First off, the story is so bad, it makes you wonder
 This is a dreadful film. A truly deplorable piece of crap, as far as I'm concerned. The acting is awful. It is as if the actors just stumbled onto the set and were told to act as if it was a movie. The script is horribly bad, and the editing is just plain brutal. The only thing I can say for this film is that it was fun to make, but once it was over, the fun was gone. I don't know if they had any expectations for this film to do well in the box office, but if they did, they were completely wrong. I honestly think that this film was just thrown together as a way to make a quick buck, and it fell flat. It was a bad choice to make a film with this title to be honest, because it is not very catchy, and it is not very funny. It's just a bunch of people who are completely out of it, and it is a horrible film. If you want to see a film that is funny, watch Mystery Men, or Little Miss Sunshine, or even Tommy Boy. If you want to see a truly awful comedy, then watch this.

Review of
 I usually enjoy a good "tongue-in-cheek" sci-fi film, but I disliked this movie on a profound level. I didn't think it was funny or serious at all. The acting was atrocious, the characterizations were awful, the story was predictable and the special effects were laughable. There is one amusing scene, which is the least one can say about the movie.

I watched it because of the director's last name, who also did "King Kong" and "The Last Starfighter" among other things. I think he is a good director.

There are only 3 good things I can say about "Phenomenon"

1) The original score by John Debney is pretty good.

2) The one funny scene.

3) The "creature" which makes its appearance at the end of the film.

That's it, I've seen better sci-fi films.

Shame on the filmmakers for making such a poor movie.

 I really enjoyed the first film, but there was a lot of hype about this one before it came out, and I was expecting the same kind of thing: a bit more passion and a more focused storyline. Instead, this film is quite boring, and not nearly as good as the first. It just moves along at a snail's pace, and the characters are annoying, while the storyline is as predictable as they come. I mean, come on--that's just too much of a stretch. The only thing that I liked about this film was the music, and I think the music is the only thing that saved this film from being a total waste of time.<br /><br />I give this 1 out of 10.

 I don't understand why this movie is so popular. If you try to watch it for the first time, you'll probably get a lot of questions why it is so popular. I just find it hard to watch and even harder to understand. If you want to see what all the fuss is about, watch this movie and then see why it is popular. I wish someone would explain to me why it is so popular. I'm stuck on this movie for a week because it's impossible to understand, and I don't even like it at all. The characters are so annoying, the actors are just not convincing. I find this movie really disturbing and disturbing. I don't understand why people like this movie so much. If you're looking for a nice, romantic movie, watch this movie, you won't be able to fall asleep.

 It's about a teenage girl that is tormented by her boyfriend who is a drug dealer. She is drugged by him and wakes up in a hospital with a plastic bag stuck over her head. She escapes the hospital and finds her way to a small town where she meets a man that is a police officer. She asks him to help her find her boyfriend. The doctor who was supposed to be treating her was found dead and the man that was helping her is being investigated.<br /><br />So, what is this movie about?

 I found this movie to be extremely boring. I have a feeling that this movie is classified as "art" or some such thing because it is not well made and the dialogue is atrocious. I watched this movie in a theater and wont be surprised if this gets the "award" for worst movie of the year. If you want to watch a bad movie, this is the one for you. I highly recommend you rent this movie and watch it over and over again. There is no plot to speak of and the acting is terrible.

If you want a great movie, I recommend you rent "The Rookie" with Dennis Quaid. It was made in 1999 and is a far better movie that "The Ice Storm".

I could go on and on about the other movies I have seen that were excellent, but I won't.

This movie is the worse movie I have ever seen and I would have to say that it is one of the worst I have seen in a long time. I would give this movie a negative grade, but there is no option available. I would give it a -1 if it was an option.

 I watched this film because a friend told me to but I was so disgusted by it. All of the cast members are great but the director is such a bad director, he ruins everything. The story was good, but the way it was made was a total disgrace. I loved it when the kid was shot, but the way he was killed was horrible, they should have just shot his head off instead of making him run around with a bullet in his chest. These are just some of the things that could have been done to make this movie better. Overall I give it a 2 out of 10.

*This film has also been known as "The Biter" and "Rogue River".

It's a shame that this movie got such a bad rating. It's a good movie. I love the story, I love the actors, and the special effects are fantastic. I wish this movie got a better rating. I know it's not a perfect movie, but it's a great movie.

I thought this movie was pretty good. It was my first time seeing
 My wife and I watched this film for the first time. We were both appalled by the "actors" and the film. The plot is really stilted, with no real character development, and the acting is so bad that it's hard to watch it. The music is also bad. This is a very poorly made movie. The plot is not believable, and the characters are not interesting. I don't understand why anyone would pay money to watch this movie. Steve Guttenberg is a very good actor, and I was shocked to find out that he gave a performance like this. It's not like the movie is worse than his other work. I don't know what the rest of the cast was like, but the people who wrote or directed this movie must be very tone deaf.

 This movie is so bad I can only recommend it to you if you want to waste your time. The acting and dialog is so bad that you don't care about the story and the plot is so stupid that you don't care about the actors. There are some good scenes in the movie, but the rest is just a waste of time and a waste of money.

I was very surprised and very happy to watch this movie. The movie was great and the actors were amazing. The plot was very good and the actors had great abilities. I could imagine all of them in the real life and I hope that they continue to make movies like this.

Overall, I think that this movie is great. The actors are amazing and the story is one of the best I've ever seen. I can't believe that this movie is so underrated and so little people saw it.

Amazing movie. The acting was very good and the story was great. I can't understand why this movie doesn't have more comments and why so little people saw it. It
 "Life is for Living" stars a wonderful cast of actors including: Danny Aiello, Viggo Mortensen, and Charles Durning. The story is about a husband and wife who have been married for over forty years, and how their relationship are tested when a young woman moves in next door with her husband. The young couple is played by Courteney Cox and David Duchovny.<br /><br />The movie itself is a very interesting story, but it is not told in a manner that is interesting to watch. The dialogue is bland, and the performances are subpar. The story seems to drag on forever, and the movie is slow and not very interesting. I have seen many other films over the years that have been based on true stories, and "Life is for Living" is not one of them.

An excellent story not told well

Very good story. It is about a guy who has been married for 30 years
 I think you'd have to have a penis to enjoy this movie. It's one of those films that's never going to get a decent DVD release, because it's so low-brow, but I can tell you it's also one of the worst films I've ever seen. The door-to-door delivery of the wine is probably one of the worst I've seen in a movie. The main characters are so stupid it's hard to believe they're the same people. I'm sure the movie was meant to be funny, but they missed the mark completely. I'd say this movie is the worst comedy I've ever seen, but that would be stretching it a bit, and I'm not even sure that's possible. If you want to see a great comedy, see Spanglish, or even the first Austin Powers movie. This one is not even close. I would also say avoid this one like the plague, but it's not like I can. I saw the trailer on TV, and really wanted to like it, but by the time it was over, I was about a broken-hearted and depressed.

I'm reviewing this movie as a movie, not a
 Well, I've been watching this movie for 2 years now, and who knows how many times I've seen it. I don't know if it's because it's a good movie or because I've been watching it so much. But I think it's the latter. Sure, I'm just a simple guy who likes to watch good movies and has no idea on what makes a good movie and what makes a bad one. But I know that this movie has a lot of bad things in it. But still, I like it and I don't regret watching it. Here's why. I like the characters of the movie and their friendship. I like the way they don't hate each other, but they are just friends. I like the characters' emotions and how they are. I like how they solve the mystery. I like how they don't forgive each other their mistakes. I like how there is a happy ending. I like a lot of things about this movie. But those are just some of the things I like about it. It's one of those movies that make me feel good about myself. If you like it too, I recommend you to watch it. And if you don't like it, I recommend you to watch
 My advice is don't waste your time, unless you're a hardcore gore monger, a fan of horror movies, or like movies that are just plain stupid. I thought this movie was kinda slow, but I thought it was pretty good. I really liked the first two acts. I think they did pretty well there. What they did before the big act in the movie was good. I liked the police guy, and I liked the way the killer was killed. I also liked the little girl, and like the mom and dad. I liked the end of the movie, but the part towards the end was a little too gross for me, and the part with the little girl was weird, but I liked that part. I know some people might get offended by the gore in the movie, but I didn't mind it. It wasn't as bad as some other gore movies I've seen. I didn't think the acting was good. I was pretty disappointed with the acting. I really thought the acting was good in the first two acts. I was really disappointed in the acting in the last two acts. I thought the acting was good in the first two acts. The second last act was way too gross for me. I thought
 I found the film to be a complete waste of time and money. I haven't seen a film like this in many years. I didn't think it was funny and I don't understand why the director chose to call it a comedy. I felt this film was a huge bore. I get the impression that everyone involved in this film is in on the joke and that's how they got funding from the government. The worst part was that the actors didn't even try to act and the director didn't seem to be in on the joke. They were just going through the motions. It was like watching my friends in a bad play or a bad movie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun movie to keep you occupied for a couple of hours, this film is perfect for you. But if you have the patience to sit through it and you think the actors are actually trying, I would highly recommend you run far away from this film. I haven't laughed once.

 The whole thing is a bad joke by the director, maybe he thought it would make a cool movie. But the plot is lame and the actors are bad. I hope that this movie is rated with a low rating and that nobody will waste their time watching this movie.

 I'm going to get a lot of heat for this, but I have to say it:<br /><br />I liked the first episode of this series. But, after that, I got very bored with it. I personally believe, there was no way to make a story about a guy who is a vampire and has a secret identity out of flying a plane. I'm a big fan of the "Night Stalker" movie and liked that it was a bad guy who did bad things. But, I'm not interested in a show about a guy who does bad things and is a vampire. I think the title should have been changed to "The Vampire: the Series." Isn't that a much more interesting title? It was definitely a bad idea to do this show.<br /><br />I'm not saying that I don't like the premise of "Being Human." I do. But, I'm saying that I like the characters of "Angel" better. I'm also saying that I think that the writing was just as horrible as the acting was.

<br /><br />I'm not saying that I didn't like the acting of the show. David Cubitt did a good job as the
 I remember when I was young, this movie was so popular. It was in the theaters so much that you would see little kids at the movies in their pajamas after school and it was always a sell out. This was the first movie to make me cry. I was about 6 or 7 and it was a sad movie. It was about a little girl named Chloe. I don't know why but I love this movie. I thought it was a great movie but I was a kid. I didn't know anything about the movie.<br /><br />I don't know what it was about but when I first saw this movie I never could seem to get enough of it. I had to watch it over and over again. I even got my mom to watch it with me. I think it was around the time they were making TV shows off of it. I think it was on one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shows. They always used to show it on at night.<br /><br />I haven't seen it in years but I always thought it was a great movie and I just never got tired of it. Everyone should watch this movie it is a great one.

 While its a shame that the original authors are not involved, I have to agree that this remake is not as good as the original. If you have never seen the original, you should watch that version first. This version has way too many scenes that are just unnecessary and don't have anything to do with the story. There is also way too much violence, even for a horror film. I think the original was very effective for its time but this version failed to become a classic in its own right.

I give this movie 5/10. (I want to know what the original means, too.)

(I know this is a short review, but I can't say much more.)

 I have never seen an episode of this show and from what I have seen on this board this show sucks big time. I have seen better shows on the WB and like I said I have never seen an episode of this show.<br /><br />I guess I am a total idiot because I actually bought the DVD of this show. I was so excited to see the show but I am so disappointed. I can not believe that I actually spent $8.00 on this show. It is nothing but bad acting, bad dialogue and bad acting. I was totally disappointed and I give it a 1 out of 10. I do mean that this DVD is bad it is so bad. I am not sure what I am going to do with this DVD. I can't believe that I did that. I don't care that much about it. I guess I just wanted to be a little bit cool and get this DVD. That is a total joke and I have no idea why I got this DVD. I guess I just wanted to be a little bit cool because I have seen all the episodes of this show and I never saw anything about the show until I saw all the commercials and stuff about the show. The show is not even all that
 This is the first movie in what I've heard was a series of movies. In short, I was expecting a movie about an alien invasion of Earth. I was disappointed when it turned out not to be that. In the movie a team of scientists is sent to the moon to investigate a meteorite that crashed there. It is soon revealed that there is a very large alien force living in the moon (I guess that there is another movie to explain that). The alien force consists of four types of aliens. The first are the "Grizzly" aliens, which are ugly but strong and very intelligent. The second are the "Lizardmen" who are also very strong and are ugly but are very stupid. The third are the "Saurians", which are very wise but very ugly. The fourth are the "Mutants", which are very ugly but very intelligent. The aliens have been living on the moon for a long time and were building a force to attack Earth. This movie is not bad, but it is not that great either. The special effects are very good, but only a few scenes (especially the opening) are well done. The acting is also decent. I guess if you are a Star Wars fan,
 Uh oh...the "B" word is coming out of my mouth again. But, this is a joke, I swear! The "B" word I mean is...beast! I've only seen two of the best film series of all time: the Godfather and the Shawshank Redemption. Now, I'm going to attempt to explain the problems that I had while watching this movie. <br /><br />Let's start with the class of the ensemble of actors. They are all good in the movie, but no one in the movie stands out. Every single character in the movie is just a stereotype, trying to be like the character they are supposed to be. This includes the main characters, who are just as stereotypical. The movie is about a man, played by Brad Pitt, who is out for revenge. After his wife is brutally killed, Pitt's character decides to go after the man that murdered his wife. Along the way, he meets many people, and each person is just an addition to the movie, and nothing more. He meets an old lady who helps him out with his car, a bartender who helps him with some money, and many other characters. The story does pick up in the middle of
 I thought this movie was bad. I was somewhat entertained, but I was disgusted at the end. This movie has a 5 minute "super" fight scene, and a couple of other scenes. There is no build up and no conclusion. I rented this movie because I thought it was about vampires, and it was actually about a different kind of vampire. The main character was already a vampire, so I'm not sure why this movie is about a vampire hunter. I don't know why he's telling people about the vampire. He's obviously not telling them about the real vampire, nor is he telling them about his secret "super" vampire friends. I would have liked to see the movie because of the part when the main character was trying to be a vampire and the final fight scene, but the movie was too short and ended without a conclusion.

<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

<br /><br />My rating: 3/10.

<br /><br />I would not pay money to see this movie.

 As a HUGE fan of the original, I have to say that this is a very disappointing and frustrating movie. I'm not sure what the director was thinking when he made this, but I'm sure he was just trying to make a movie. I found myself yelling at the TV "this is stupid, this is stupid, this is stupid! It's not funny, it's not funny, it's not funny!" I love the original, and this movie didn't do it justice. I'm not sure if it's because it's only comedy and not a comedy-thriller, but it just didn't work. This movie was just plain stupid. If the director had taken the time to get the script right (which would have been good, because it's really not that good), this would have worked, but unfortunately it's just a lot of stupid jokes that are just not funny. I'm sorry to say that this is the second time that I've seen this movie and I'm not impressed by it at all. I would advise any fan of the original to stay away from this movie. It's not funny, it's not scary, it's just a waste of time.

 This film is about a guy who has to get his girlfriend to a concert. He has a friend who wants to hook-up with her and he uses his other friend to do it. He gets in trouble with his girlfriend's father and the rest of the movie is him trying to get her back. This film was very predictable and had very little originality to it. The actors did little to help this film. The whole movie was very dull and boring and it didn't entertain me at all. I would not recommend this film to anyone. My grade for this film is a D.

This is one of those movies where you wonder "Why the hell did I pay for this movie?" It's one of those movies where you say "Oh, it was pretty good," but you know you're lying to yourself. It's one of those movies you can't not talk about it to friends or people at work. I'm not in love with this film, but I'm not hating it either. I like how the first 5 minutes of the movie is a montage of the main characters. It sets the mood for the rest of the
 It's not a review, but I want to add some thoughts about this movie because it did something to me that I don't like to see repeated: I was deeply moved. I can't say it was a good movie, or a bad one, but I will say that the experience of the movie was wonderful. It did not make me laugh, or cry, or be angry, or anything else. It did something to me that I've never experienced (perhaps I've been too sheltered in my life to have experienced it, but I really hope that's not the case). The movie moved me. It was moving. It was beautiful. The scenes were so well done, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of the movie. I truly believe that Mr. Mosely did a fantastic job of creating a movie that will continue to move people. I know this was not the intention of the movie, but it's really not a bad thing either. It's something that happens with movies like this, even ones that are seemingly intended to be somber (think "Mighty Aphrodite"). It's something that shouldn't be called out, but if you've ever been moved by a movie, then you
 I've read every comment on this film, and because of the sheer number of them, I thought I'd post my own. I can't believe that this film has been given so many great reviews. It's surely the worst film I have ever seen. I don't think I've ever been so bored and insulted by a film. I saw this film last night, and by the end of it, I really didn't care if it was over or not. The cinematography was awful, the editing was a mess, and the acting was terrible. I was sitting there thinking, "What the hell is going on here?" and by the end, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I'm sad to say that I'm a fan of '80s horror and I can't believe how bad this was. I just don't know what to say about it. The plot is about as interesting as your basic slasher flick, and the use of special effects is laughable. There are so many things wrong with this film, it's hard to know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the acting. I know I'm being kind here, but the acting was truly awful. The only one that did well was
 This movie is a rip-off of the Twilight Zone. The narrative is weak, the acting is poor, the special effects are laughable, and the plot is flimsy. I was really disappointed in this movie. The Twilight Zone is one of my all-time favorites, and this movie really did not live up to the expectations that I had. The ending was even more disappointing. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have nothing else to do.

"Scary" is the only reason I gave it a slightly higher rating than "1"

I absolutely hated this movie. I expected a lot from the director, and I only found the acting mediocre. The special effects were laughable. It was not scary at all. It was a complete waste of time. I won't watch it again. I would not recommend it to anyone.

This movie is not scary, uneventful, or even very interesting. It's not even funny. I found it to be complete and utter garbage. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is horrible, the story is weak, and the special effects are even worse. This movie is not even scary. I don't know what else
 I remember when this movie first came out. My friends and I went to the theater to see it. I had high expectations and I was very disappointed. I felt the movie lacked direction and story line. I was also disappointed that they did not show the full story of John Wilkes Booth's life. What I remember most about the movie was the "midget" (I think his name was Phillip) playing Lincoln. He was very funny, especially when he was in the jail. If you like "horror" movies this is not for you. I liked the movie because of the little boy playing Lincoln who was very talented. My favorite part was his rendition of "Battle Hymn Of The Republic". My least favorite part was the way they portrayed John Wilkes Booth. The way they showed him was very cruel and not very believable. I felt the movie was over-rated and I don't recommend it.

 If you're looking for a classic horror film this is not it. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is bad and the story is dull and boring. There are moments of pure genius but the rest is just painful and irritating. The leads are awful, the special FX are laughable, the gore is pretty average, the story is poor and the ending is just silly. The DVD box is worth a look but don't expect much from the movie.

 This movie was a bit of a disappointment. I had high hopes for the film, because it had a lot of promise. It was a mystery, and I liked the mystery aspect of it. The movie was a bit on the slow side, and the characters were a bit shallow. The performances were okay. Some of the characters were not very likable. The movie was a bit slow, and the story line was not very well developed. The film seemed to be a bit of a drama and a bit of a thriller. I think that the movie was trying a little too hard to be a suspenseful film. The movie was not very tense. It was a bit predictable. I was not really a big fan of the film, and I am not sure that I will be buying the DVD when it is released in February. I am sure that the film will be a hit, but I was not overly wowed by it.

 I wonder if it's possible to rate this film lower than 5 stars. I'm giving it 5 but only because I can't rate any lower. This movie sucks. There's a reason that it has only been watched by (according to IMDB) 10 people. If you have a friend who loves this movie, I can assure you that they are not friends of yours. I've seen several of the other reviews and even though a lot of people say that it's cute, I can assure you that it's not. It may be that it's a cute movie, but it's put together so poorly that it's absolutely unusable to anyone with a shred of intelligence. I think that this movie was made to teach kids how to make movies. It's a movie that was made intentionally to look like a bad movie, to see how bad it can look. If you are a student who is making a film, please don't make a movie like this. That's what it's for.

I was going to give this movie a 1 star review, but I figured that I would give it a 2 star review instead. The only reason that I didn't give it a 1 star review was because it was entertaining. It

 I don't even know where to begin with this one. I have never been a huge fan of the idea of a ghost story, the whole "ghosts are scary" bit just doesn't do it for me. But when a movie is made with a name like something like "A Nightmare on Elm Street", or "The Amityville Horror" I decided to give it a chance. And I was very disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the bad lighting. I don't know if it was intentional or not but the lighting was absolutely awful. And the casting was horrible. The only thing that had any personality to it was the little girl and that was only because she had a creepy little voice. All the other actors were just plain boring. The story was just plain stupid. The story was about a family that stayed in an old house that was haunted. And then all of the sudden the ghosts started attacking them, and the father just goes "Oh, that's it huh? I'm gonna have to have a sit down with my son and have him put a stop to all this nonsense. " I mean come on, go to some of the other horror movies and you'll see that they always have the scary enemy, or
 The original was a classic of its type, but this remake (which was almost identical to the original) was dull and unentertaining. The characters were uninspiring and not well-defined, the story was unsatisfying, and the ending was anti-climactic. It was a remake that never came anywhere close to the original. Also, this film was not scary, and there were many places where the plot could have easily been cut and the film would still have been acceptable. The film was very predictable and uneventful, and was one of those rare remakes that failed miserably.

 I can't imagine why anyone would want to go see this movie. It's ridiculous, stupid, and painful to sit through. The plot is about a woman who goes to investigate a deal on a condo she owns, and is being held hostage by a criminal. The movie has little to do with the actual condo deal, but the condo is supposed to be a symbol of something else that is going on. While in the condo, she meets her mysterious neighbor, and some other people who are supposed to be important to the plot. Then there's a bunch of weird subplots involving a mysterious woman, a bunch of guys who are supposed to be thugs, and a bunch of other weird things. There's a stupid love story that's supposed to make everything seem a little more touching, and a ridiculous fight scene that doesn't contribute anything to the plot at all. There's a bunch of pointless action scenes, and then a bunch of pointless conversations that are supposed to be funny. The movie has a bunch of stupid characters that aren't funny, and a lot of stupid dialogue that isn't funny. The movie is supposed to be set in Florida, but it makes you really wonder why the writer thought it was a good idea to set the
 I'm not sure why this movie has so many good reviews. I watched it and I must say it was not very good.<br /><br />I watched it with my girlfriend and she reminded me that this was a french movie so I should be more open minded. But it was not that bad, the first half hour of the movie was the worst for me.<br /><br />In the beginning I was thinking that it was a good movie, the plane crash was very good, the first half hour was very good and I was thinking that this movie would be a great movie.<br /><br />But then the movie just became a stupid one. The movie turned into a horror movie, the actors were not very good, the dialogues were not very good, everything was just bad.<br /><br />I think this movie should have been a short film, the first half hour was the only good one in the movie.

 I was very disappointed with this movie. The two lead actors were good, but the plot was very contrived, and the story was not believable, at least not to me. The only good thing about this movie is that the story was an original, but I didn't find the plot very believable. It was not scary at all, which is what this movie is supposed to be about. I was surprised because I usually like to watch scary movies, but I was not impressed with this one. I am glad I rented it, but I won't be buying it. I still like the horror genre, but this one fell short for me.

 This movie was a real disappointment. The plot is really really bad and the acting was only mediocre. This movie is a total waste of time and money. After a good start, the movie just goes downhill and is nothing but a mess. The main characters are very poorly developed, the plot is confusing and the end is not worth the trouble. I saw a lot of movies in my life and this one is one of the worst.

What disappointed you about The Last Act of Frank Feely?

The plot was terrible and the acting was just mediocre.

What was the most interesting aspect of this story? The least interesting?

The story was the only interesting aspect.

Who would you have cast as narrator instead of David Shipman and Michael Pare?

There is no narrator in this movie.

What reaction did this book spark in you? Anger, sadness, disappointment?

I was disappointed with the plot
 This is a pretty interesting book, but I don't think it was made for the screen. The book has lots of details about the girl's family. I think that for the screen to work, the emphasis would have to be on the family and their life, rather than the girl's life in the book. The whole movie seems to focus on the girl. She does have a lot of screen time, but I thought that the focus was off. There were a few times where I thought "okay, she's now going to turn out to be a good person, that'll be interesting." It didn't happen. The guy in the book seems more interesting than the guy in the movie. The girl in the book seems more interesting than the girl in the movie.

I think that if this was a book, the movie would have been more interesting. I thought that the movie was pretty boring. I didn't feel any sympathy for the girl - I thought she was really really selfish. The book had more of an emotional effect on me.

I'm not going to watch the movie again.

I think that this would be a good book for an English class to read because it has a lot of details that
 I have to say that this is by far the worst film I have ever seen. First of all, it is way too long, and there is little to no plot or characters. I also have to say that the acting was terrible and the story was boring. Although I do like the fact that it is all done with computers, and it seems to resemble a video game, however, it is not a good video game.<br /><br />There are many things that I did not like about this film. First of all, I hated the animation and the computer graphics. They just didn't seem all that good. Also, the story was boring and the acting was terrible. The characters were all boring, and they weren't very likable.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone. I would give it a 2/10, only because it was not a horrible film, and I did not find it so painful that I had to go to the hospital after having seen it. Also, the fact that it was not too bad.<br /><br />

 Oh, that's right, I'm a fan of Burt Reynolds. I'm not a fan of this movie. A few people wrote in to say that they really enjoyed it. I'll admit that I did too -- it's just not a very good movie. I'm sure Reynolds did his best in it, but the movie itself just isn't. The premise is that an aging rock star and a young woman meet for the first time and decide to get married. I thought the idea was kind of unique, but the movie is just not very well done. Reynolds is a little bit old to play the part of a rock star, and the love scenes are silly. I guess the movie was supposed to show that Reynolds was still sexy and that he could still attract younger women. That's fine, but the movie could have done this without the silly love scenes. The movie also tries to show that Reynolds is still able to play the guitar. As a guitar player myself, I can tell you that Reynolds is not in the same class as Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't just have Reynolds play the guitar, or at least not have him play it in the movie. The movie
 At first, I thought this film was going to be a clever and entertaining take on the whole "billboard" phenomenon. I was wrong - it is just a campy, sloppy and badly directed film. The character of the billboard is so hackneyed and dull, it is a wonder that they would even bother to set it up at all. The "star" of the film is absolutely wasted, the director forgets to include him in many scenes and appears to be trying to hide him behind the billboard. The "plot" is thin and boring and the films twists and turns are predictable to the point of absurdity. Don't waste your time or money on this. It really is that bad.

4/10

**Spoilers**

The film is obviously about a relationship between a billboard and its owner. The billboard is a simple and boring creature that does nothing but stand there and look at cars. The owner is a pretentious, obnoxious and absurdly selfish individual who spends most of the film being a jerk. His primary purpose seems to be to get the girl and then dump her. Of course, he doesn't realize this until the end, but it is pretty obvious. The whole film is a
 This is not an accurate depiction of the life of a doctor. This is a movie about a doctor who must overcome a lot of moral and ethical issues in order to become a good doctor.<br /><br />The movie is also filled with a lot of melodrama and so many coincidences that make the movie unbelievable.

1. The main character named Dr. Henry Adams is supposed to be a good doctor who does not have a lot of fear and is able to overcome the fear of death. However, at the end of the movie we see that Dr. Adams has a fear of death. He is filled with fear at the end of the movie. The city of Philadelphia is also filled with fear and anxiety. And the movie also makes it appear that Dr. Adams is also afraid of being a bad doctor. These are all untrue. Dr. Adams is supposed to be fearless and is able to overcome his fear of death. In fact, Dr. Adams' mother is also supposed to be able to overcome her death. These are not depicted in the movie. There are numerous other mistakes.

2. In the movie, Dr. Adams is supposed to have an affair with a nurse. His wife is supposed to find
 I'm not a big film buff and I'm not a big horror fan. But I love the original Halloween. The original Halloween is a perfect example of a great horror film. A lot of people hate on this film but it's still one of the best of all time. And I'm not saying that because I'm a fan of the franchise. The one thing I didn't like about this movie was the new Jamie Lloyd character. It was just a bad character and I don't think she fit into the film at all. All of the characters in this movie were great. The new characters were made for the sequel and if you can't see that then you need to get a life.

The acting is great. The characters are great. And the special effects are great. This movie has a lot of great moments. But I won't ruin anything for you. Let's just say that this movie is a must see. If you're looking for a great horror film to watch then this is the one. And if you're not a fan of the franchise then you'll still enjoy the movie. This movie is one of those films that you can watch over and over again.

 I have to say that I was very disappointed with this movie. I saw it on TV today and I was hoping for more. It wasn't scary at all. The characters seemed to be a little too shallow, and the acting was not convincing. I was hoping for some good scares, but it wasn't to be. I was also hoping for some good eye candy, but it was not to be either. I would give it a 3 out of 10. It was not bad, but it was not good either. If you like scary movies, or just want to see a good horror movie, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are looking for the next "Halloween" or "The Others," then you would probably enjoy it.

**spoiler alert** I think that this movie was very good. I don't think that they were trying to scare or bs us. I think that they were trying to make a good movie. If you are looking for a scary movie, then you will be disappointed. But, if you are looking for a good horror movie, then you will like this movie. If you are looking for a good laugh, then you will not like it. I give it a 9 out
 As part of a series of films made by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud (The Bear, The Law of The Lion, The White Countess), this film was hailed as the most beautiful and the most moving film in a decade. The reviews were unanimous.<br /><br />You will be disappointed. The film is gorgeous. It is filled with beautifully lit vistas, handsome shots and sweeping music. The acting is superb, particularly the acting of Rachel Weisz, who won her Oscar, as did Annaud. The storyline is interesting, and the acting is superb. But it is not moving. It is not engaging. It is not interesting. I am surprised the film did not win best film. I was. I have seen the film three times, and I am disappointed each time. I cannot recommend it for a single viewing. If you like films about the beauty of nature, and especially of water, watch the film.

5.0 out of 5 stars The most beautiful film, and a huge disappointment. Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I was very excited to see this film, as it was highly acclaimed and I was looking forward to a stunning film. However, I found it a huge disappointment
 You know, it's just not that funny. I see some of the people on the message boards who are saying that "the laughs are easy to come by". I watch this movie and I'm laughing at the same jokes for about a minute and a half. Then I get to the closing credits and I'm laughing at the same jokes for about a minute and a half. Then I get to the end and I'm laughing at the same jokes for maybe another minute. And that's it. I'm done with the movie. I can't recommend it. If you want to waste a night (and money) you can rent it and if you're like me and don't want to waste a night (and money) you can just wait for it to come out on video.

As for the movie, it's not that bad. Sure it's not the funniest movie ever made but it's not all that bad either. I'll give it a 5/10.

Also, the nude scene is not as explicit as it sounds. It's just that the director decided to make it hard to see the actual nudity.

Bottom line: Don't watch this movie. It's not that good. Just wait
 I'm a huge fan of Jules Verne, and have been since I was a little kid. I've read many of his novels in their original French and enjoyed them, but when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, hey, I'm in for a good time. So, I went to see it with my parents, and I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's a shame, since I've never been a fan of computer-generated graphics, and this movie does use them extensively, which I don't think is necessary. I would have preferred seeing more of the actual science fiction in this film, rather than the special effects. The plot is also very weak, and the characters are pretty flat.<br /><br />But, worst of all, is the very annoying "stereotype" of the female lead, which is so pervasive in the film that it's almost impossible for me to get through it without rolling my eyes. She's the typical "airhead", which I think was a ridiculous idea to begin with, as it's not usually the case in real life, and it's not any more realistic in this film than any other movie. Also, the movie is full of
 "From Hell" is an absolutely terrible movie. The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the special effects are bad, and the whole film is just boring right from the start. I enjoyed it barely. It has a huge budget, and it shows in the movie. It is, however, a good example of what a film can be, when too much money and time are spent making it. I thought this film was supposed to be a "black comedy", but there is nothing funny about it. I really don't understand all the hate this film has gotten. Sure, it's not a comedy, but it isn't supposed to be a comedy. It's a crime movie, and I can't imagine that anyone thinks this film is a good example of a crime film. "From Hell" is just a bad film. I give it 1 out of 10 stars, and I hope this film doesn't get an Oscar, because it will be a travesty to the movie community. It's such a bad film, it deserves no awards.

This film was nominated for "Best Cinematography", but I think it is a travesty that the Academy nominated it for that award. The cinematography is not good
 I am afraid to say that I have never been so disillusioned by a movie as I was by this one. There is a genuine feeling of excitement when watching a movie and a real sense of being transported to a world that you would like to be a part of. This movie was the polar opposite of that. I do not want to give away the plot, but I will say that it is utterly predictable and totally inept. The actors were stilted and wooden. The special effects were completely inappropriate and very embarrassing. I think I actually laughed at a couple of the scenes. The only thing I can think of that might have been appropriate was the music. But then, that was the only thing that made this movie tolerable. I am sorry to say that this is the first movie that I have actually gotten really angry about. I think that I have seen so many movies in my lifetime that I have come to expect a certain level of quality. I would have to say that this is not just the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is also one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

 This movie was awful. It lacked any story, it lacked any development, it lacked any plot and it lacked any logic. It was just a bunch of people on a beach with nothing to do. Everything happened in a very uneventful manner and it was just a bunch of very boring people. There was nothing to look at and nothing to enjoy. This movie was not only boring but pointless and it was the worst movie I'd ever seen. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I'd definitely not watch it again.

 Wow; this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The storyline was terrible and the acting was atrocious. I can't believe this was even made. The dialog was awful and was laughable at times. I would never watch this movie again. The music was awful, the camera work was horrible, the special effects were terrible and the editing was choppy. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would warn anyone to stay away from this awful piece of junk. Avoid it at all costs!

I was disappointed by this film. The acting was not very good, and I just did not sympathize with anyone or understand the plot. It was "so-what" and "meh" to me and it could have been better. The dialog was terrible. I felt it was not well written and it was not believable. The storyline was not believable, and the ending was like that of any other teen movie. I would not recommend this movie.

 Instead of making a movie exploring the life of a great poet, or a fantastic story, or even a documentary, this movie is just depressing and depressing. The main idea is that when you're young, you don't have any problems, you're happy. After that, the movie ruins everything, it ruins the poetry and the lives of the people in the movie. I usually like to watch documentaries about people that lived in a difficult time, or that had bad luck and died young, but this movie is just depressing. I have to say that I didn't enjoy it at all.

 I didn't realize at first that this was a comedy. I thought, it can't be a comedy. I mean, it's a movie about a young woman who's a law student and wants to be a lawyer and she has to work her way up to be a law student, and she has a crush on a guy, and she has to keep her grades up, and she gets kicked out of school and she goes to California, and she has to make it as a lawyer. And there's this one scene where she's working as a waitress and she's trying to get a job as a lawyer, and she's trying to get her work done and she's being a waitress and she's talking to the other waitresses and she's getting all this information from the other waitresses and she's making this phone call and she's getting all this information and she's trying to make it as a lawyer and she's trying to get her work done and her work is piling up and it's all just too much. I thought, it can't be a comedy. I mean, it's just too much. It's really too much. I mean, it's really too much work. This is real work. This is really
 Just watched this film for the first time a few weeks ago, and I have to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen; I'm not sure why I didn't feel this way before, as it's quite a long film and I watched it over two days. I think the main problem is that it's crap entertainment. It's just a series of awful 'slapstick' scenes where the actors do the most ludicrous things to each other (like the one where the guy's nose is cut off), while the 'story' is so stupid that you can't help but be bored. For example, there's a scene where two men are fighting with swords, while two other men are in the background talking to each other. What?! No, don't ask me why, it just doesn't make any sense. Then there's the scene where one of the guys is locked in a room with a bunch of women, and he has to fight them to get free. Who in their right mind thinks that's a good idea? Why not just have the women fight over him? The answer is that it's just supposed to be a comedy, which is a shame, because there's no reason to think it's
 The first thing to say is this is not a well produced or well written movie.<br /><br />Maybe there is some inherent chemistry between the two leads. But, as the movie progresses, the writing becomes more and more hackneyed. Then the acting becomes more and more over the top. The interplay between the actors becomes more and more strained and the plot becomes more and more contrived and confusing. <br /><br />The movie ends with a somewhat abrupt ending. It leaves the viewer with a feeling that there is something more to be discovered, but it doesn't give the viewer anything except a feeling of confusion.<br /><br />The movie is better than average considering the low budget. The acting and the writing are adequate for the genre. But, for all the movie's flaws, I can't help but feel that there is something more here.

 This movie is just a bad rip-off of Lord of the Flies. In fact, the only thing I can see that makes this movie different is that there aren't any animals. The kids aren't even much like kids. They're almost like feral children. I couldn't care less about this movie.

I thought the acting was terrible. They all sounded the same. I only saw this movie because I wanted to see Lord of the Flies again. If I wanted to see a bad rip-off of Lord of the Flies, I'd just rent it. I hope this movie is as bad as Lord of the Flies.

I also thought the writing was bad. I mean, the kids have no parents. They don't even have any kind of structure. They are just these wild, crazy kids. They have no food, no shelter and no rules. I thought the movie was full of sexual innuendo and foul language. The kids were constantly fighting, but it was not shown on the screen. I think they should have shown the fighting, because they were really fighting.

I really didn't care what happened to the kids. They were just these wild, crazy kids. They didn
 This is a very poor film. If you watch the film, you will see that it is a very poor film. The plot is weak and the acting is not too good. The only saving grace is the fact that it is very campy and over the top. This is not a good film for a family to watch. It is a film for those who want to see a film that is over the top.

I would not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good film.

 This is a very disappointing film. The first thing i noticed was the bad acting. The film is very uneven, but mostly the direction is boring. The acting is very poor. First of all, Paul Newman's acting was very poor. He was very unconvincing in the film. Secondly, I didn't feel any sympathy for him at all. He is a very cold, selfish, and unsympathetic character. The only person i felt any real compassion for was his daughter. The acting of the child was however, very good. I did however feel sorry for the other children. But the children were never really developed. They were just there to be used as a plot device. I don't know if it was the attempt to add suspense or the direction of the story. But the film is very uneven and boring. The film is also very long. The film is over two hours long. It is a very tedious film. It is not an enjoyable film to watch. The film is not very suspenseful, and the script is unremarkable. The film is very slow, and at times the film was almost boring to watch. The film is not very well developed. The film is very predictable. I can guess what
 This is an average crime drama. For a few minutes, it tries to be more than just that. The plot is ordinary, but the performances are good. I don't know what happened to the director, but this is not his best work.

I was really into the first two thirds of the movie. The acting was good, the story was interesting and the direction was alright. But the last 20 minutes fizzled out, and the movie turned into a regular crime drama.

I can't blame the actors for this, but the director is to be blamed for the failure. I was very excited about the climax, but it didn't live up to its set-up.

There is some gratuitous violence in this movie, but it doesn't make it bad. The violence is there to show that the murderers are bad people. The whole movie is about that, but the writer did a terrible job with it.

The writer did not give the audience any insight into the murderers. They weren't bad people because they committed murders, they did so because they are bad people. That would have been the theme of the movie. The writer just needed more time to develop the characters.

 At least I hope that the novel was better than this film. I know that the film has been made in India, and that the Indian film industry is not known for being the best, but I was genuinely disappointed. The script is weak and the acting, though not bad, is not all that good. I had hoped that the film would be better. I will say that the cinematography is excellent.<br /><br />The story is that of a young man who returns from America to India to find his childhood sweetheart, the daughter of his father's boss. The girl he wants to marry is his cousin, but the father of the girl is against it. The father is a ruthless and evil man who does not like the American in his house, who is a visitor there. The American has to stay in the house, but is not allowed to see the girl. The father is even jealous of the American, and thinks that he is the one that should marry his daughter. Then the American is accused of murder, and is imprisoned in the house. While he is in prison, the father orders his housekeeper and her daughter to keep an eye on him. The father wants to make sure that the American does not have anything
 The film starts out with a great premise, a new plague that kills people, just not in the normal way. It then proceeds to fall apart from there. They managed to keep the "pulse" and the "rage" of the plague, but the pacing, acting, and the dialog just aren't there.<br /><br />The "pulse" is a disease that brings on an amazing fever; the "rage" kills anyone who gets near the victim. The "rage" is a disease that brings on uncontrollable, almost animalistic behavior. What makes me say that is that the "rage" is probably the most far-fetched thing about the movie. There is no way that people would go on killing each other with no provocation, and there is no way that people would be so uninhibited with their killing. The acting is also not that good. The actors should be ashamed of themselves. The acting is so over-the-top that it just makes the movie look absurd. For example, the rage is blankly shown on the victim's face, when in reality, this disease should be a slow-acting one. Also, the "rage" is shown in a few scenes. The movie would have been
 Don't bother with this one. Just another B-movie cheapie with a weak budget and not much else to offer. A cheapo ripoff of the original, with a few added scenes of nudity, sex and violence. What's the difference between this and the original, again? Well, this one is about a college student who is murdered, and the killer is one of her students, who is then killed. By the end, there are a lot more characters than in the original, but you'll have to see it to find out. The first half of the film is pretty dull, as the two main characters, a criminology student and a gay teacher are trying to find out who the killer is, and the killer gets away, but not before the teacher, who has a crush on the student, gets a little bit of a look at his ass. The second half of the film is better than the first half, but still not worth watching. The killer is not a very good actor, so he doesn't do very much in the film. The killer's girlfriend, who is also a student, is actually a lot better, as she's not a bad actress, and is actually pretty good in a few scenes
 I'm writing this review for two reasons.<br /><br />Firstly, as an avid fan of both "Enter the Dragon" and "The Killer Elite" I was eager to see if this would live up to the hype. Now I'm not one to complain about "Enter the Dragon" or its director John Woo. I think he's an awesome director and his films are some of the best action movies ever made. "The Killer Elite" is no exception. But I don't think I'd recommend that anyone watch this. The reason? They're both awesome action movies. But "The Killer Elite" is no action movie. It's more of a political drama set in the British India. The action is so-so and the ending is as underwhelming as the way it all ended.<br /><br />Secondly, as a new director and his first English language film, I was eager to see what he had to offer. After watching "The Killer Elite" I'm glad I didn't waste my time seeing "Shanghai". It didn't help that I had to sit through the most boring English language film in the world.<br /><br />The film starts off very well. We're introduced to the
 I don't know why this movie was so popular. It was terrible. I didn't understand a word of what was going on. The acting was just bad, and the plot was weird. The only thing I liked was the end, which was the only thing I could say was good. The beginning was bad, and the middle was bad, and the end was so bad. I don't know why people like this movie. I recommend it to no one. It was not good. I don't know why this movie had so much hype. It was just not good. I don't know why anyone liked this movie. I'm sorry. I don't know why anyone would recommend this movie to anyone. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't know why anyone would watch this movie. It was not good. It was just not good. I don't know why anyone would watch this movie. It was just not good. I don't know why anyone would want to see this movie. I don't understand why people like this movie. I don't know why anyone would watch this movie. I don't understand why this movie was so popular. It was just not good. I don't know why anyone
 I really want to give this movie a high rating, because I really like the director and the actors, but I can't. This film is a mixture of different genres. It has elements of a black comedy, a drama and a thriller. I think the director was very clever in doing this, since he was able to create the right atmosphere for each of these different genres. This is a very good film, but I think it is too confusing and you need to be a very open minded and patient person to be able to enjoy it.

I think the main problem of this film is that it isn't very clear. There is a lot of symbolism and a lot of black humour, but I think this is too much. I think the director could have made the film simpler, but he didn't. As I said, this is a very clever film, but I think it could have been much better.

I think the main actors are quite good, but I think this is too much. I think the main actress is a very good actress, but the more she acts and more she's in the main role, the more I think she should have been replaced.

It is a very good film, but I
 I don't generally like video games or movies about video games, but "GoldenEye" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is awful, the story is boring, the effects are poor and the characters in the movie are uninteresting and generic. I saw the film with my two sons and we all agreed that it really is a terrible movie.<br /><br />I can't believe that this movie was made and released as a major motion picture. It's a video game movie? I've seen much worse.

"Corpse Bride" is one of the worst movies ever made (in my opinion), yet it was made into a major motion picture. "GoldenEye" isn't even a good video game movie. How did this movie get made? What happened?

<br /><br />This movie is a disgrace to the video game genre.

4/10

Stick to video games, kids.

…
 I don't usually write bad reviews, but I had to give my opinion on this film. The acting is the worst I've ever seen from the all the stars of the movie (and I love these actors). The film is very slow-paced and the direction is very poor (obviously it was shot on a video camera). The story line is poor and the ending is ridiculous. I won't even go into the "topic" of this movie. I was bored out of my skull. The only thing I can suggest is that you rent it to see how bad it is.

I have to say that I was rather disappointed with this film. I was hoping for a good film about homosexuality and faith, but unfortunately I got far from that. The film is absolutely stupid, it is just plain boring and the acting is horrible. The movie is about a bunch of teenagers that are dying to be in a gay club. They try to find the gay bar in the country where the most people are dying to
 Well, I love the old horror films and I love to watch horror films, but this one was just not that great. It was alright, but I just never got into it. The characters were just not that interesting or likable, the story line was a bit tedious, and I didn't really care what was happening, besides the fact that it was a bad guy just trying to find someone to turn into a zombie. Also, like one other post said, there were some parts that just made me go... "Seriously?" That's the only reason I gave this one a three.

(P.S. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch this, just that I felt it was really boring. But you're still free to watch it!)

**Warning: Spoilers**<br /><br />The story is about a young girl who lives in the city and has a normal life. Suddenly, she starts acting weird and she is seen with a dark colored figure (the "bad guy"). Her parents are determined to find out what is going on, but they don't know where she is. The "bad guy" tells the girl that she has to become a zombie
 I thought this movie was rather boring and not very funny. The plot was a little too slow. It was a little frustrating to sit there and watch the actors do nothing but sit around. There was nothing funny in the movie to make it enjoyable. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.

 This movie is one of the worst things that I've ever seen. The acting is really bad, I mean really bad. They actually made Jules Winnfield into a boring character that you can't take seriously. The script is awful, it's boring, and it's all over the place. The music is awful, it's a bunch of cheesy 80s music that sounds like it was made for an 80s movie. The cinematography is bad, there's no body you can look at without seeing a bad costume and a bad hairdo. The editing is bad, the movie is just too long and there's too much going on to keep track of. The movie is also overlong, there's scenes in the middle that could have been shortened up so it would have made the movie more enjoyable. And the ending is just a joke, there's no point in making the movie as long as it is to end on just a funny event. The movie had so many things wrong with it I'm surprised it got made at all. I mean the movie was just bad. I can't even decide which part I liked the least, it was so bad. The movie is not funny at all, it's not even a comedy
 This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only reason I was able to sit through the entire film was because I knew it was about a serial killer and I wanted to see how the story played out. It was boring, the acting was terrible and the story sucked. I was really hoping it would be better than it was.

I'm having a hard time for not rating this film. It's so bad, I'm not sure how to rate it. It's not a bad film, it's just a terrible film. It's not scary, it's boring and pretty much a waste of time. I think the only reason why I finished it was because I had a lot of free time and it was a free rental and I was curious to see what I would think. I'm not going to see it again, I won't recommend it and I won't rent it again. This is one of those films where I think if you ask any person who has seen it they will say "It was okay" or "It was okay for a B movie". It's not a good film, it's a bad film.

 I've seen some very bad movies, but this is one of the worst. It's like a bad science-fiction movie, with a few good attempts at comedy, but mostly dreadful. The basic plot of the movie is like a bad spoof of "The Matrix," with a group of people trying to find the "Gates of Hell." They go into a warehouse and end up in a virtual reality world where they are attacked by the bad guys and have to fight to survive. If you have ever seen "The Matrix" you will know where I am going with this. If you haven't, let me explain. "The Matrix" was an excellent movie, which was a very dark and scary look into the future of our world. It showed us that in a few years we will be living like we do now, and many of the things we see in the movie will be reality. In this movie, the people who are trying to find "The Gates of Hell" are in a virtual reality world, which has the same feel and atmosphere as the real world. The main difference is that you can see it all around you. In "The Matrix," you can see the world around you in the computer world, but you can't
 This is a bad movie. Really bad. I don't think it's the cast's fault. They don't have enough to work with. There's a little bit of chemistry between the two main actors, but I think that's because they know each other from the past. The script is poorly executed, the direction is clunky, the editing is choppy, the sound is flat, and the music is completely amateurish. There's no payoff to the story. It's just a bunch of "huh?"s and "I wonder what happened to X"s. It's like the producers went on a huge scavenger hunt and stumbled across the worst of everything they could find. It's obvious that there's a lot of money behind this film, but it doesn't make it any better. I don't think the producers ever intended to make a film. I think they were just trying to get a free trip to the Sundance Film Festival, and they had the misfortune of coming up with this terrible and embarrassing mess.

The only good thing about it is that it's only an hour and forty-five minutes. It would have been even worse if it was three hours.

I give it a D+.
 The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it tries to be funny. But it fails. The running joke is that this movie is based on a true story but it isn't. The first half is nothing but a long attempt to make the viewer believe this is a true story. The only thing that makes it even remotely funny is the fact that the main character is only 10 years old. The second half is just as bad as the first. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has such a poor plot. The director must have been high on drugs when he wrote this, or he just plain didn't care about the result. But I guess that since it is based on a true story, it has to be true.

 This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still shaking that I wasted a dollar on it. It's a story about a wimp who is afraid of bugs and somehow gets caught in a jungle. The story isn't any good and the acting is subpar at best. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It's about 15 minutes long, but it feels like it's been 15 years long. But don't worry, there's a sequel. And it's even worse than the original. Why would I tell anyone to watch this movie? I would rather watch paint dry. I would rather watch a cement truck run over me than watch this movie again. And I would rather turn into a bug and live a happy life.

I've seen worse movies, but this is up there with the worst. I'm getting depressed just thinking about this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I give it a 1 out of 10.

 This movie was a complete waste of time, money and effort. The cast were atrocious and the story just didn't work. I thought the movie was going to be a comedy, but it was a drama. The movie could have been a good one but the director didn't agree with that. I don't want to spoil the movie, but it wasn't good in the end. It's so bad that I don't want to spoil it. I think the movie was a failure and a waste of time. I don't think anyone should see this movie. The story was horrible and the acting was bad. The director was a big bag of crap and the writer was a total failure. The ending was quite the shocker. I don't want to say a word about the ending because I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone. If you want to see a better movie than this, I suggest you rent the movie "Liar Liar" instead.

It was a total waste of time and I didn't even like the movie.

I give the movie a 1/10 and I don't recommend it to anyone.

I saw this movie in the theaters and I wanted to give it a 9
 The first thing that struck me about this film was how it was made (it must have been made on a budget of about £50,000, and the general feeling of the film was that it was made with a few pot plants, not a lot of traffic lights and a shot of the sea thrown in for good measure). The film was amateurish in the extreme.<br /><br />The second thing that struck me was that the director had apparently decided to make a film about sex and drugs. And so he did. The problem is that the film is not about drugs and sex. It is about three people who have reached the moment of truth, have sold everything they have, have nothing to lose and nothing to gain from selling their souls to the devil. They are selling their lives to the devil, and so they are selling their bodies and souls.<br /><br />The problem is that the only person who looks like a sex addict is the one who looks like he is selling his soul to the devil. If he could get a load of the drugs and the sex, he would not be selling his soul to the devil. And if he could get some of the drugs, he would not be selling his soul to the
 I felt as if I'd just seen a bad European film, or a bad Bollywood movie. There was little evidence of the magic of the original.<br /><br />The original film was hilarious and it was a joy to see the different characters interacting with one another. In this, they are all meant to be the same character played by different people. There is no chemistry. The actors have no chemistry with each other, and their character's dialog doesn't have the same wit and sparkle as the original.<br /><br />I was surprised that the film was a musical. I thought that this was a style that was meant for musicals. It's not. The film is a musical only because the film makers felt that it would be a good idea to put some music in. However, the music does not fit. These characters are not in a musical, and therefore the music is completely out of place. The songs are not good and do not fit the film.<br /><br />My advice is to avoid this film. See the original, or the Penelope Keith version of the film.

 I saw this movie on a drive-in one night. I was about 14 years old. I remember thinking the title was stupid, and at the time I had never heard of the channel that was showing the movie (I didn't know what it was called until later). I remember not liking the movie.<br /><br />I saw the movie again in 1981 and again in 1982, but I didn't remember anything about it. I think I was a bit too old to get the whole thing.<br /><br />I saw the movie again in 1990 and was blown away. I was shocked. I was shocked by the acting, the story, the direction, the special effects, the music, the cinematography, the editing, the sound, the pacing, and everything else. The movie is superb!<br /><br />I was and am a big fan of John Carpenter's work, and this movie is just as good as any of them. If you are a fan of horror, suspense, thriller, or any other genre, this movie should be in your collection.

<br /><br />I strongly recommend you see this movie, and I strongly recommend you see it at least once.


 I thought this movie was intelligent and well presented, but it just didn't make me laugh. The only reason it got one of the top spots is due to the fact that I was in a theater with a bunch of people who were laughing at the wrong parts. So I don't recommend this movie. It is worth renting, though.

If you are a fan of the TV show, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

The Fugitive (1993) A classic that is still entertaining 14 March 2001 - 0 out of
 I have always wanted to see this movie and when it came out on DVD I bought it. I watched it and after about 15 minutes I knew I was watching a piece of crap and it was going to be a waste of my time. The movie has some really poor acting and the story was just not interesting. I think the movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it was not funny at all. It is such an awful movie that I actually feel sorry for the person who made it. The best part of the movie was Matt LeBlanc. I think he was doing a remake of the movie "Joe Dirt" and he was very good in it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I also think it should not be released until the video quality is much better. I do not think that the people who made this movie should ever be allowed to make another movie ever again. I actually hope that Matt Le Blanc does not get his own show because I would never watch it.

 This is a very tedious movie, the pacing of the movie is too slow and the script is a complete mess. The acting is very poor and I felt sorry for the young actress. If you want to see a young actress who will grow into a good actress then this is one to see as she is not very good here. The music is also very poor and the future looks very bleak for the young actress. I can't see this young actress having a successful career.<br /><br />This is a very painful movie to watch and I certainly don't recommend it. It is an awful script with very poor acting and a very poor director.

 I am, admittedly, a big fan of the original "The Shawshank Redemption", and I have read the book on which it was based. While I have a strong respect for the original film, this film is a clunker. The problem with this movie is that it is not very well made. The actors and actresses are not that talented, and the writing is not very good. Although I have read the book, I found this film to be a constant bore. The story is a little too predictable. In the book, the character of Andy Dufresne is really cool and really intelligent, but here he is a goof who kills people when they are being unreasonable and boring. Also, the character of Ellis is a lot more interesting here than in the book. The only interesting part of this film is the character of Red.

I do not recommend this film to anyone.

 I rented this movie to see how bad it is, and it was very bad. The biggest problem is that it is boring. The music is bad. The story is bad. The acting is bad. The script is bad. The only good thing about this film was the fact that it was funny. So if you want a movie that is just plain bad, this is for you.

 I thought this movie was terrible. It was not entertaining and I had to keep reminding myself that it was supposed to be a comedy. I also had to keep reminding myself that I was supposed to be laughing.<br /><br />The acting was atrocious. The only character I found remotely funny was the guy with the huge nose who was constantly trying to get into the girl's pants. I don't think anyone else was funny, and I ended up skipping the rest of the movie. I would have preferred to watch paint dry.<br /><br />As for the plot, it was a bunch of dumb stuff that, by the end, was not even worth watching. There were so many scenes in this movie that were just random and confusing that I thought it was going to turn into a porno. When I watch pornos, it's usually because the plot is interesting, and the characters are interesting, and I'm looking forward to watching them. This movie had nothing going for it except the fact that some of the actors were pretty good looking. Also, the camerawork was ok, but not great. It was just the story that was bad.<br /><br />I have heard that the movie was based on
 I am a huge fan of all four of the films in the series. I think this is one of the best of four. It is still a good story and Bronson does a great job playing Lincoln.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this film is the fact that it is not historically accurate. Lincoln is supposed to be a very mellow, very quiet person. This movie does not show him to be that. I am not sure why, but he is extremely annoying and very obnoxious.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is the story. But if you are a fan of the series I would recommend watching the other three films first and see how they compare to this one. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably like this film. If you are not a fan of the series, I would be very hesitant to recommend this film.

 I think this was the first movie I tried to watch. I fell asleep after the first 45 minutes, and I've never been able to finish it. I've tried to watch it several times, but I just can't finish it.

I don't know if I'll ever watch it again, I don't think I have the patience to sit through it again.<br /><br />Maybe it's time to cut my losses and move on to something else.

<br /><br />I don't even know if I could tell you why I don't like it. It's not the movie itself, it's just that I just can't finish it.

I really don't think I'd recommend it to anyone, though. I've tried to talk to people about it, but no one wants to watch it.

 this movie was so bad and boring. i could not wait to get it over with. the only good part was the part where shakira was on the screen. i would not recommend this movie to anyone. i found it boring and i was constantly saying in my head "what is going on". i guess i was expecting some kind of action movie, but there was none. i don't know what the point of the movie was. i guess they thought they had to make this movie because they wanted to make some money. i am so bummed that i wasted my money on this movie. i don't understand why they even have a sequel. i think it is a horrible idea. i will never watch that movie. i am not even sure if they made a sequel to "the exorcist". i thought they wouldn't make another one. but they did. i guess they hope that they will make more money. i don't know. i am just so disappointed in this movie. i thought it would be a lot better. it was not. i think it was a bad idea for them to make this movie. i think it was a bad experience for me. i don't feel like watching the sequel. i don't
 This movie is very bad, it's not funny, it's not action, it's not even suspense. It's just one of those movies that are so bad they're good. I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this one is just plain terrible. There is not a single redeeming value to this movie. I couldn't even figure out why this movie was made. Yet, I can't stop watching it, because it's just so bad it's good. If you like bad movies, then this would be a good choice. If you hate bad movies, then stay away, because this is not a good movie.

 I'm not sure if it's just me, or if there is a problem with the "art director" of this movie, but i would like to know, since it's difficult to follow, poor writing and a poor casting (for example, the "nuns" are not nuns, they are a bunch of women dressed up like nuns, and the "priest" is a guy, dressed like a priest). I can't even tell who is who. And the fact that it's a "horror" movie, doesn't make this movie any less laughable.

I know that it's just a movie, and that even movies like this can be made, in a perfectly good way, but this one is beyond the point of being funny. Maybe it's just me, but it's just not funny at all.

 I felt like I was watching a bad episode of the old detective show 'Columbo'... I saw this movie for only $6.00 at my local video store. To make matters worse, I loaned it to my roommate, who also thought that it was a bad movie. I am pretty sure that I will never watch it again. It was so bad that it was actually funny at times...like the scene where the main character, who is the star of the movie, is being accosted by the bad guy (the one who goes by the name "The Chinaman"). He is a big, fat guy, who is supposed to be the bad guy. The Chinaman comes up to him and says "I'll let you go, but you better return my money." The guy then says "I'm not that kind of girl, Chinaman." I laughed out loud at that part...

I like a good action movie, but this movie is totally ridiculous. It was supposed to be an action movie, but the action scenes were so badly done and so unbelievable that I couldn't even enjoy them. I think that the main character was supposed to be a tough guy, but he was so unlikable that
 This is a pretty awful movie and it makes me feel bad for those who find it entertaining. I'm sure some will disagree but I think the script is god-awful. The plot is just a subplot of the "story" and the main characters are pretty much useless and boring. The actors and actresses are seriously bland and do little with the material they are given. The only people who are good are the director and cinematographer. I also thought that the "surrealist" bits were pretty overdone and somewhat unbelievable. Also, the end was pretty ridiculous, and not in a good way. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Part of me thinks this movie would be better without the "surrealist" bits. If the film makers were to do that, then they should have gotten someone else to direct, because this guy is a hack. I heard that the film was supposed to be a horror movie, but to me it felt like a satire. The director also seems to have let his ego get in the way. He doesn't seem to have thought about what he is presenting on the screen. The camera work is the only thing that holds this movie together. But in the end, the film directors
 I'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie. I'm more interested in what the big deal is about the people who are saying this is the best movie of all time. I think it's because it's about two people who meet and fall in love. I think it's not the movie that's so great, it's the fact that people seem to be afraid to watch something without a message. They don't want to see a movie where people get to be happy. So they take something that's just a movie, and they make it a political statement. I think that's why this movie is so terrible. That's why I hate movies like this. Good movies are movies that are just movies. They don't have to have a message. If you have a message, you should make a book instead. It's funny, I was listening to a song the other day and it was talking about how people get so caught up in ideas they don't remember to think about what they're doing. So if you have a message, you should make a book.

Oh, I almost forgot. I feel bad for the guy who made this movie. He's probably just a kid. He probably doesn't have
 This is a rather dull, dark film. The story is not well told, the characters are not well developed. The plot is not exciting or thrilling. I found it rather boring. The acting was fine, but the story was not compelling. I am not sure anyone would find this film entertaining.

The plot is about a woman who is trying to get back a child she thought she had given up. She is looking for the child in the New Orleans underground. This is very disturbing because she is a child molester of young boys. There is a young boy she has taken in and raised as her own son. Now she wants him back. The plot is not really about the child. It is about her. She is trying to find her son and get her life back in order. It is the story of her trying to find her son that is told in the film. I found it to be a very depressing film.

The setting of the film is New Orleans. The streets are dark, the area is not well cared for and the people are rough looking. I don't understand why the film was made in New Orleans. The film is dark and depressing. It is not a light, fun film. The film
 I expected much better from this movie. I was really looking forward to it, but it was not all that great. The story is about a guy who gets possessed by a demon. The guy was not a horror movie, because he does not get killed. It was all about his relationship with his girlfriend. It was a very interesting story, but the movie was not that interesting or scary. It might have been nice if the movie was a "true story." There were parts in the movie where I was thinking, "Wow! This is so cool!" but then there were parts where I was thinking, "This is stupid!" I think the movie would have been much better if it was about a person that does not know he is possessed, and the people that help him. The movie was supposed to be about a girl named Jennifer, played by Rachel True. This girl really got on my nerves. She was so annoying and dumb. I think it would have been better if they had put the character of Jennifer in the movie. Instead of getting a new boyfriend, he would be possessed by the demon, and go around to different people and kill them. I know that this sounds confusing, but it would be a lot more interesting. I
 When I first saw this movie at the theatre, I was impressed with the acting, the directing, and the story. I thought, "This is it. This is the love story that Hollywood is capable of making." But then I saw this film again at home on DVD, and I was very disappointed. The acting seemed wooden, the directing was amateur and sometimes incoherent, and the story was not developed and was not very believable. I would give this movie a grade of C+

Tina Fey and Paul Rudd have a great marriage. Their relationship is real. They are the best couple in the movies that I have seen in a long time. I have no problem with the marriage in this film, but I am very disappointed that the story was not developed. It was just a bunch of things that happened to them. If a film does not have a story, then it is not a movie.

I tried to like this film, but I did not. I could not get into this movie. Not many people have seen this movie, so I do not know if it is a good movie or not. I am going to give this film a grade of C.

Reviewer's Rating: C+


 I don't understand the people who say this movie is good. It's not. The plot, as far as I could follow it, is a rehash of the first movie, but with less plot. The movie is full of crude humor, with lots of swearing, violence, and sexual themes. This movie is meant to be funny, but only as far as it goes. There are no depth to the characters and the acting is horrible. The plot is so thin that you can feel the movie thicken as it goes on. The story is a bunch of people trying to survive on a spaceship. They are attacked, and the ship gets boarded. They fight off the boarders, and then the movie ends. There is no moral to the story. There is no meaning. The movie is just bad, and I could not even get it to be entertaining, because the whole concept of the movie was pointless. This is one of those movies that you watch, and you are not even sure you are watching a movie. I'm sure that anyone who says that they enjoyed this movie must have been very stoned or drunk.

 I tried to watch this movie, but it was so bad that I couldn't continue watching it. I had to turn it off after the first 15 minutes. After watching some of the comments on IMDb, I'm surprised that anyone even bothered to put it on their list of the worst films of all time. The plot is about a man who is the leader of a gang. He is an expert at shooting people and is a bit of a loner. He meets a woman and they seem to like each other. Then a police officer shows up, who is also good with a gun, and tries to kill the man. The man manages to escape his pursuer and runs away. The rest of the movie is about how he tries to find her and why she was after him. This movie was awful, and I recommend that no one watch it.

 This is not one of the best films I have seen, but it sure was an entertaining one. I was surprised that it was not a more expensive film, but the story was good and entertaining. I think the lack of any real suspense may have been the biggest drawback, but I still really liked it. I have a strange fondness for movies about World War II that have a good story and some humor. This one certainly fits the bill. The cast is good, although the characters are not as fleshed out as in films like Saving Private Ryan. The movie was made on a modest budget, so it doesn't have any of the huge explosions, but it is still fun to watch. I highly recommend it to people who like films about WWII, but it is not as good as Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers.

I give it ** for entertainment.

 I read the negative reviews for this movie and thought, I'll give it a shot. I don't think I'll ever watch it again. I was totally bored with it.<br /><br />The only aspect I enjoyed about it was that it was done in the 70's. I thought the clothes were cute. The movie is about a group of friends who come to visit a friend's grandmother. They all have different perspectives on life.<br /><br />I thought the most boring part of the movie was the mother-in-law's house. I thought it was just the most uncomfortable room I had ever walked into.<br /><br />I'm not saying it was a bad movie. I just think it was just plain boring. There were some funny parts that made me laugh but they were not enough to keep my attention.

A silly little movie, but it was fun!

Author: mjillen from United States

This movie was fun, but not the best of the series. But it was funny, and I think my favorite part
 This is a very strange film: a sort of psychological thriller, a kind of existential drama, a strange story about a man's descent into madness and his attempts to cope with it. The director seems to have real difficulty making up his mind about what he wants to do with the film, but I think this is because the story is so bizarre and difficult to understand, and so hard to relate to, that he's decided to be ambiguous and "general". The story is told in a very flat, detached and (I think) deliberately surrealistic way, so that it's not clear who the characters are and what they mean, or whether they're real or made up, or what they're all about. The characters are just there to do strange things and say strange things, but it's not clear why they do what they do or what they mean. The tone, I think, is that of some kind of textbook "psychological thriller"; the director seems to want to find out what it's like to be a paranoid schizophrenic and to experience the "turning inside out" of the self which is the subject of the story; but the story itself is difficult to relate to and the way it's told makes it almost impossible to
 This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I thought it was about a circus clown and after seeing the trailers, I was expecting to see a circus. It was to me, a bunch of clowns from the circus trying to get a job in the circus. I am sorry, but that is the best description I can give you.<br /><br />If you like clowns, then this will be a great movie for you. If you are not a clown, don't even bother to see this movie. It is boring and meaningless. It is a waste of time.

<br /><br />A very average movie. I give it 1 star.

<br /><br />If you like clowns, then I think this is the best movie ever made!

<br /><br />If you don't like clowns, stay away from this movie!

<br /><br />Here is a trailer for you to watch!

<br /><br />I love the circus!

 I finally got the time to watch this movie and I have to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know what it is about this movie but it just sucked!! I have a couple of friends who like horror movies but I don't think they enjoyed this one. I don't know what it was about this movie but it was awful. I don't even know if I want to watch it again but I'll probably end up watching it anyways because it is one of those movies that you can't just forget. The only good thing about this movie is that it was somewhat mildly entertaining. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see a horror movie make sure it's not this one. This was a horrible movie.

 I thought this movie is a typical saccharine romance movie. But I was wrong. The main character who plays the role of the good guy, is so lame and so annoying. The story is pointless, the dialogues are terrible. There is no love story and this movie is a complete waste of time. The only thing that I like about this movie, is the beautiful acting of Kim Nam Gil, who plays the part of the bad guy.

I wish I could give it a 0, because I hate this movie from the bottom of my heart.

I would recommend you to watch the movie, if you are interested in seeing the acting of Kim Nam Gil, who plays the role of the bad guy.

The main character is so lame, that he makes the movie worth watching.

I rate it as a 0, because I hate it.

And if you don't hate it, then I guess you are masochists.

 Sadly this film is probably the most memorable movie I have watched in my entire life. I was hoping to get some enjoyment out of it, but it was a real disappointment. The director was obviously trying to put out a film that was "cool" and "hip", but the movie just wasn't cool or hip enough for me, and it certainly wasn't entertaining. The movies main problem was that it was completely predictable from the beginning. I had all the information I needed to know about the plot in about five minutes.<br /><br />The story was about a teenaged boy who lived in a gated community in the middle of nowhere. He grew up in a trailer park and had a terrible upbringing. The movie makes it look like his father was abusive, but that was only hinted at. He was just a typical kid with a bad home life. His father is a creep who works with the local drug lord and has an affair with his wife. He's also the local police chief, which makes him easily the most corrupt person in the entire town. He's the one who kills the kid's mother by taking off her head with a shotgun. Then he goes after the kid's father and shoots him in the leg. He
 I have seen many movies in my life, and this is the first time that I can say that it was a bad movie. Stealing candy is an old movie. I have seen it more than 20 times, and I've never gotten bored with it. I guess that because I was very young when I first saw it. I probably watched it in a movie rental store. I never rented it and I'm glad I didn't because a lot of the scenes are really boring. The movie has kind of a predictable ending, and the acting is terrible. It's like watching a very bad play or a bad television show. I think that it is kind of a cliche movie. It's not one of my favorite movies, but I still watch it from time to time. It's not a bad movie in the sense that it's really bad, but it's definitely not very good.

 A man is arrested for a murder he didn't commit. After spending eight years in jail, he is released on the condition that he live and work in a mental institution. He is the only one to make it through the entire movie. The rest of the patients range from the petty to the downright disturbing. Every character is either a complete jerk or a complete moron. The only character who is likable, but who is not one of the main characters, is the cop who is there to help the protagonist when he needs it. The antagonists are as bland as the main characters.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to a friend if they were looking for a good prank to play on me.

 I was disappointed in this movie and I thought it was a waste of time. I did not even get to the end of the movie because I did not care what happened to the characters. I didn't even care if they were killed, even though I knew they were going to. I got all wrapped up in the last part of the movie, and was surprised there was no ending. I feel sorry for those who have a problem with this movie and watched it. I was disappointed in the movie and the director, too.

If you like a good horror movie, watch Something Wicked This Way Comes. It's a classic, and one of my all-time favorites.

If you're looking for a good horror movie, watch The Grudge. It's very good.

If you want a good horror movie, watch The Exorcist. It's one of the greatest horror movies ever made.

If you want a good comedy, watch Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. It's very funny.

If you want a good comedy, watch Hot Rod.<br /><br />

 This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. It was so bad that I almost forgot to write my review. The acting was so bad that it was hard to watch. I can't believe that this movie got made. I would have laughed if someone had suggested this movie to me. The only good thing about this movie was that the last scene was a good one. I would have to say that if you have never seen this movie, don't waste your time. This movie was the worst thing I have ever seen and I am not into bad movies. Don't waste your time on this one.

5.0 out of 10 stars A good idea not executed well.

I got this movie by accident. I had seen many people post about this movie and I wanted to be one of those people that said it was a good idea. But I was wrong. What I got was a movie that came up with an idea and tried to make an attempt to make it work. The idea of the film is that a man is driving home on a long road and he has a flat tire. He pulls over to change the tire and while doing the change he finds that his wife has been in a car accident and
 I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but I find myself disappointed. The plot is interesting, and the acting is fine. But it just doesn't work. The acting is a little too stiff, the plot is too predictable, and there's no suspense to speak of. I don't think I've ever seen a film that I'd rather have been watching on TV. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, unless you're a true fan of the book and don't mind the plot being changed.

On their way, they meet a young man who is driving them and gives them a brief tour of the country. After the tour, the old man's wife tells him that it seems to be a coming of age movie he's made. The movie cuts back and forth in time through his life. He is a young man in love with an older woman, who is married to his best friend. He falls in love with his best friends wife,
 It's not a good movie, I don't think. The acting is awful, the plot is cliched and the acting is on par. The only thing that is good about this movie, is that it is short. It is not a good movie to watch out of boredom. I am a fan of the original SNL and I think this is a bad parody of the film.

 This is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and the dialog is the most ridiculous dialog I've ever heard. I say this as a person who loves bad movies and has seen just about every bad movie made. I would give this movie a -10 if I could. The only reason I am not giving this movie a 0 is because it is somewhat watchable. Don't see this movie.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the point of this movie is. It seems to be trying to be a bad movie, but it just ends up being a bad movie. It almost feels like a "Saturday morning cartoon" with bad special effects. I just don't understand the point of this movie. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that is more nonsensical than this one.

 I'm glad this movie has many positive reviews here, because if it didn't, I'd be much less impressed...<br /><br />What's funny is that the movie was released in the US and it's dubbed - we'll never see the original version, so I guess it's all the same.

It's better than some of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's so bad that it's good. I just don't get it. How could you make a movie like this? The acting sucks, the story sucks, the visuals suck and the dialogue is so bad it's good. This is a movie that couldn't get a Home Video Release. I can't believe it was released in the US and dubbed. I have no idea who did the dubbing, but I can't wait for the original version. This is one of those movies that would be really really really good if it was in a foreign language and with subtitles. The dubbing is horrible. Just watch
 This may have been a good movie if you believe that you can pull off a serious role and then be funny in the same movie. For example, Michael J. Fox, the funny guy, was in a serious movie called "Back to School" in which he was a teacher trying to teach young kids how to be mature. In "Get Smart", he was a spy who was funny at the same time. This movie has the potential to do this, but it doesn't. It's almost as if the writers had too much respect for the serious role and wanted to make him funny. If he were funny in the first place, then it wouldn't be so bad. But he was serious, so he wasn't funny. It just doesn't work. The movie itself was good. But, after the first half an hour, it's obvious that the writers were trying to be funny and the actors were trying to be serious.

I can't see how they could pull it off if they tried that in a movie they thought was going to be serious.

 This is one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of the original series and this movie is just as bad as the latest "Star Trek" movie. The acting is horrible and so is the story. The effects are well made but the story is stupid. I agree with a previous reviewer that this movie was made for the fans of the original series, but I think it's safe to say the fans are not going to like this movie. I think it's a lot better than the recent movie but still a waste of time. If you want to see a good "Star Trek" movie, rent the "Star Trek IV" disc.

I honestly thought that the Borg was going to be the bad guy in this movie. But it turns out to be the Federation. I guess the Borg have to go around with the Federation. So it's the Federation that's destroying the Borg, not the Borg who are destroying the Federation. I think that the movie gets way too serious and that the movie should have been more comedic. But the movie's full of stupid scenes and it's not even fun to watch. I can't believe that a movie like this

The acting is so bad that I sometimes wanted to see the actors get hit in the face by a baseball bat and then be eaten by a shark. I'm just kidding. I would like to see it happen. I would also like to see the actors get hit in the face by a baseball bat and then be eaten by a shark. I'm just kidding, too.<br /><br />Second, the movie is so stupid that there's a character in the movie that has "The Final Countdown" playing in the background. That's the first time I've seen that song played in a movie and it's going to be the last time I ever see it played in a movie. I mean, the movie is just so bad that it makes me want to see the song played in a movie.<br /><br />Third, this movie is
 What a disappointment. I have read all the reviews and more, and I'm still surprised by the poor quality. The acting is horrible. The acting is the worst I have ever seen in a movie. The female lead is as wooden as a Muppet on Sesame Street. I have been a fan of other movies by director Adam Rifkin, but this is just not good. The acting is so bad, I honestly hope the lead character dies. The dialogue is flat and boring. The story has no tension. The cinematography is just awful. I'm still trying to figure out what the title "Buried" means. It's not a movie, it's a nightmare.

I thought this movie was a pretty good suspense film. The acting was a little wooden, but the story had lots of suspense and a good twist at the end. I was surprised by the ending and I like the way the movie ends. The story was pretty good and I enjoyed the twist at the end. I would not mind seeing a sequel to this movie.

 I went to see this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival and, although it had a great premise and some good actors, it was utterly forgettable. The direction was first rate, but there was no real script to speak of and the acting was not particularly good. I'm not saying it was bad, but people do not usually walk out of a movie with their mouths wide open and no idea what they just saw. The movie was a complete failure at the festival, and I must say I am not surprised.

The story of Janis Joplin was never all that exciting, but her life was. The movie just didn't do it for me.

 I loved the first "Animorphs" book series. I have been waiting for this and was so excited to see this movie. I was very disappointed. The movie was so boring and so poorly done. The only reason I say I am disappointed is because of the book series. If you had not read the books, you would be lost. You would not know who or what the characters were. The movie was so confusing and I was so bored. At one point I actually fell asleep. I do not recommend this movie to anyone except for the die hard fans of the book series.

 This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is so bad, that I don't even want to give it a rating, because I don't want anyone to see it, and be put off from seeing any other movie. I'm sure that I could find a good movie to see, where they were actually trying to make a good movie. They could have had a talented cast, a good script, nice characters, and a good story. The story is horrible, the acting is so bad, I can't even pronounce half the names correctly. The characters were so boring, I didn't know how they were supposed to be like. And the special effects were so bad, that it looked like they just threw some blood together and called it a day. I have no idea how this movie got made.

 I saw this movie in a movie theater on a Saturday night in the late 80's. I was a young virgin and didn't know much about the subject matter of this film. I was totally unprepared for the graphic nature of the imagery. I was expecting a straight forward, no-nonsense, "racy" movie. I was stunned when the movie started. It was as if I was watching an X rated porno flick. The movie started with several young girls having a sexual encounter with a man who was apparently a pedophile. The girls all agreed to the encounter, but I must admit to feeling embarrassed for the male actor who played the man. He was obviously acting and looking uncomfortable in the situation. The movie progressed to other situations where the girls were being raped, beaten and molested by men. The girls portrayed in this movie were all about 16 or 17 years old. I don't know what the moral of the story is. But I do know this movie was very disturbing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

 The only good thing about this movie was the song. One of the most annoying songs I have ever listened in my life. The movie was complete crap. It was not even worth the price of a ticket. I watched the whole thing in 3 hours...so boring. And there were a lot of scenes that did not make any sense. For example, the scene in the beginning where the guy wants to see a movie with the girl. When he talks to the girl on the phone, the girl does not even notice him. And the movie never explains the reason for that scene.

 Well I must say that I was a little disappointed in this movie. I was expecting a lot more. The acting was great, but the story line was very disappointing. I had to really concentrate on the movie to keep from falling asleep. The movie is about a boy who is on a mission to save his father's life. He is kidnapped and it takes him on a quest to save his father. I was expecting more laughs than the movie gave me. I was expecting more of a twist and more action. I was expecting more from the movie. Overall I would give the movie a 4 star rating.

 I was hoping for a sequel to "Anaconda." Unfortunately, this film is a total waste of time.<br /><br />I have never seen a film with such poor acting or directing, and I have seen some bad films. Here is a sample of how bad the acting is.<br /><br />The actors are trying to say "I love you" to the bad guy, who's returning the favor. The bad guy is making all these hideous expressions, and the actors look like they are in a trance. Even worse, the bad guy is supposed to be a huge ***, but he looks like a pudgy, short-tempered high school kid.<br /><br />The dialogue was worse than a bad B-grade slasher film. I can almost guarantee that this is the first film in history where I completely forgot the title of the film.<br /><br />Watch this film only if you are a morbidly curious person who wants to see a bad film, or if you are a film student at Film School. Otherwise, avoid this film at all costs.

 I'm not a fan of horror-flicks, but I saw this one at a friend's place because I knew it was a cheapo rip-off of a classic. I was expecting a cheesy, low rent, bloodfest, but was surprised to see a decent film. The acting wasn't anything to write home about, but I thought the script was good and the set pieces were consistent with the genre. The film looks like it was made in a hurry, but it's not bad. I wouldn't watch it again, but I can't outright say it's a waste of time. You can definitely tell that it was made for a cheap audience and that it's a made-for-TV movie. If you're not a horror-fan, you won't be disappointed.

*spoiler alert*

The end is especially good, though. It's so cheesy, yet so satisfying.

I got the idea to write this review from the ending of the movie. I'm curious to see if it's in the original "Urban Legends" series.

If you want to see a really cheesy/gory horror-flick, you can watch "Candyman" with Tony Todd.
 This movie is a waste of time. I remember when I first saw it and I was like, wow, that looks cool. I rented it and watched it and was blown away by the idea of the game and the characters. But the plot was horrible. It was filled with plot holes, and that made the movie not fun to watch. But the plot holes are not why I am giving this a 2. The plot holes are just plot holes. What made this movie bad was the acting. It was horrible. The actors were just plain awful. I did enjoy the graphics, but the graphics were not enough to save the movie. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone, except for people who are really into the game. Because that is really all this movie was made for. If you are into the game, then you might enjoy this movie. But, if you are not into the game, then don't waste your time.

 I don't know what this movie was supposed to be, but it was a total waste of time. I don't know why they made it, but why? It just wasn't funny at all. There was very little "jokes". The only real funny thing was when they were trying to pass the test to get the alien's (or something like that) mind and they would have the guy say one of the alien's names and they would put a picture of the alien in front of the guy. That was funny. Aside from that, it was just a stupid movie. I would recommend skipping it and finding something else to watch.

Rating of

1.5/4

A couple of years ago I saw The Big Lebowski and that was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I guess this movie was trying to be funny, but it wasn't. Honestly, I wasn't laughing at all. There was nothing funny about this movie. It was just kind of weird and creepy. I think the reason I liked The Big Lebowski was because it was a comedy and it was well written comedy. This movie was just not funny. I think 4/10 is the right rating.
 The Third Annual Dog Show is a light-hearted, low-budget comedy about a middle-aged dog handler and his friends (who are also competitors in the dog show) as they get up to all sorts of mischief, often involving the female population of their small town. <br /><br />The movie is in black and white and is filmed in the same sort of style as a British comedy "for the family". The comedy is mostly derived from the slapstick comedy, so if you're looking for depth and nuance, this is not the movie for you. But if you're looking for a light, feel-good comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, this movie is perfect.

<br /><br />There's not too much to say about The Third Annual Dog Show, other than that it is a very enjoyable movie. It's not the best film I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. It's been sitting in my video library for years and I've only just got around to watching it.

<br /><br />I'd recommend checking it out if you're looking for something light and fun to watch.

<br /><br />My rating:
 Without a doubt, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I personally think that any person who could sit for 2 hours and watch a movie without falling asleep, is mentally retarded.<br /><br />The acting was horrid, the dialogue was awful, the plot was horrible and the photography was terrible. The only thing that was good about the movie was that the girl was hot. The rest of the movie was a big disappointment. The movie could have been written in one sentence. "I heard that my best friend's boyfriend is getting married and I have to save the day." That is all there is to it.<br /><br />As for the acting, the lead guy should either take acting lessons or get his teeth pulled. He's so over-the-top that it's easily to make him laughable. The girl is really good, but she's not enough to save this movie. Also, the director should have never let the guy direct this movie. You can tell he's not a good director by the way he shoots the lights up in the scene with the girl in the mirror.<br /><br />Overall, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not even worth renting.
 This is probably one of the worst films I have seen I've seen in years. It's really painful to watch. I really like the idea of a movie where the hero is a loser and the heroine is a supermodel. But it doesn't work. The fact that the hero looks like a loser doesn't matter because we're supposed to believe he's a super-hunk. And the heroine looks like a supermodel and she's supposed to be a model. But she's no supermodel. But the movie is just a total mess. Very predictable and very silly. The characters are not convincing. The situations are not plausible. There is no chemistry. There's no story. It's just crap. I think I should make my own movie about a couple who are in love and who are friends.

Please, do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.

 To be honest, I really don't know what to say about this movie. I guess that I should start by saying that this is not a complete waste of time and I can see why people who like this kind of genre would love it. The movie is a bit too strange and surreal for me, but I have to admit that it is the kind of movie that I like to watch, so I can't really think of any reason why this movie would be bad. The acting is decent enough, and the film is obviously well made, but when it comes to the plot, I can't really say anything. The movie is about a guy who is dying and decides to tell everyone about his life, but the problem is that he doesn't know who he is or what his life was about. His memories are all jumbled and he is confused, but he decides to start a new life and then he meets a girl and starts having a relationship, but then he realizes that he doesn't know her, so he thinks that maybe he is dead, and his friends are trying to help him to find out who he is and what happened to him. All in all, the plot is a bit confusing, but at the same time, it
 I am not sure how they came up with this movie, but it was worth the effort. If you are from the 70's, you will have a lot of fun with this movie, especially if you can get the original. If you are not from the 70's, you will probably enjoy this movie only for the music. The plot is not much, you have to wait for the music to start. I was expecting to see the original, but instead I was treated to a B movie. I don't think I will watch it again, but I will see the original again.

Bottom line, if you are a true fan of the original, you will probably enjoy this movie.

** spoiler alert ** Before I saw this movie, I had not seen the original. When I saw it, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made.

Although the music is not as good, it is still
 This is a bad movie and should be avoided at all cost. There is just one reason for that: it was made to exploit and glorify the hero, who was a military man, and to show his agony and sufferings. The military men were portrayed as big criminals who were most cruel and violent people. It is not the case! The military men are the most honorable people on earth, who are only doing their duty. They are the most compassionate and they simply do their best to protect the peace, safety and freedom of other people. They are not the most cruel and violent people as these people of the movie make them be.

This movie is full of lies and misrepresentations. The movie claims that these military men are cruel and violent people. They are only doing their duty.<br /><br />The movie claims that the military men kill innocent people. There is not a single case where the military men intentionally killed innocent people.<br /><br />The movie claims that the military men are the most cruel and violent people on earth.

 The movies are just not good enough to make it worth watching. The actors are all mediocre, the settings are rather boring, the dialog is not very convincing and the camera work is not very well done. The story is neither interesting nor original. And it's really not worth the time to watch it.<br /><br />It's a very disappointing movie, comparable to the movies of the same genre by other directors.

The movie was not at all convincing. At one moment in the movie the protagonist tries to talk with a person in a car, who then drives towards him, but the camera is not able to show this. What a waste of money. It is just not believable. Also the movie has a very strange ending.

I feel that the director, who has directed many other movies, simply did not have enough time to realize his movie, and that's why it is so bad.

I would not recommend this movie at all.

The movie is rated PG-13 in the USA and PG-13 in the Netherlands.

And the rating in the Netherlands is more than a little bit low, I think. How come the rating is only PG-
 Looking at this movie, I feel like I'm looking at a bad piece of paper collage. It has no discernible point or purpose. It looks like a bad student's art project. It has nothing to do with the "Hollywood Gold Rush" portrayed in the trailers.<br /><br />The actors do a decent job here. The plot is somewhat interesting. The film's use of montages is a little cheesy. It's not completely terrible. It has a few funny moments. But, overall, it's just not a good movie. If you have to see it, just do it for the sake of your fellow moviegoers. It won't be worth it.

*** This review may contain spoilers *** I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The plot was intriguing and the acting was good. The beginning was a little slow, but as the movie went on, it picked up. I was a little annoyed with the way the ending was set up, but overall
 This movie does not hold up to today's standards. The acting was merely passable for the time, and the plot is too simplistic for it to be truly "great." The movie was supposedly based on a novel by Lindsey Davis, and the only novel I have read by her, the one titled "Mortal Fear," was an excellent read. Watch "The Mummy" instead and gain a better appreciation of what an excellent movie should be.

 It's very difficult to make a film that is so over the top stupid that it's funny in a bad way. This film seems to be by a director who never made a movie before. Yes, it's a black-and-white silent film, but it's so bad, it comes across as a cartoon. The dialogue seems like it's just something someone wrote to fill the time while the actors were waiting for the next shot. The film itself is over the top, and the actors are almost comical in the way they act. All in all, it's just not a good movie. I'm a big film fan, and I've seen some pretty bad movies, but this is a tragedy.

There is one redeeming quality about this film: it's funny. The first time I watched this movie, I laughed for almost an hour straight. I've seen other silent, black-and-white films that are not nearly as bad as this, but I've never seen one that's so over the top. It's almost worth renting just to see the bad acting, but the "crude" jokes are the only reason to actually watch this film.

This is a movie to rent if you want
 I just watched this movie last night and I thought it was a terrible film.<br /><br />The good points were the cast, which was good, the scenery, which was beautiful, and the story, which was good.<br /><br />The bad points were the acting, the direction, and the script. The acting was stiff, wooden, and somewhat cringe-worthy. The direction was very stilted and the script was totally unoriginal. It was like a rip-off of "Say Anything" and "Every Which Way But Loose". I know it's not a good movie, but that's why I gave it two stars. If you want to see something that is so bad it's good, see this movie. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this film.

 I read the reviews of this movie before watching it, and was prepared for the worst. Although I was a little disappointed by the movie, I am still glad I watched it.

I thought the script was well written, and the story was very well done. I thought it was a very good movie, and was well worth watching. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the ending. I found myself wanting more, and was left wanting more. I was left feeling very unsatisfied, and was left saying "what the heck?" I felt like the movie would have been better if it had ended differently. I thought it could have been better, and more interesting. I found myself thinking about it for a few days after watching it.

 I'll admit I was a bit disappointed by the end result of this movie. It was a very good idea, but the writing and the acting was less than stellar. The movie really has quite a few flaws, but those aren't the main ones I have. There were two main characters, and the two were not developed at all, and their relationship felt forced. The "joke" at the beginning of the movie, saying that two people only need to love each other once, which was supposed to be funny, fell flat, and was completely unneeded. The movie was very predictable, and the ending was too Hollywood for my liking. There were aspects of the movie I really enjoyed, and things that I thought were mildly interesting, but overall the movie was just average.

 I rarely write reviews, as I am very upset that so many people waste their time watching movies like this. The acting is weak, and the plot is ridiculous. You would think that a movie of this caliber would have better acting, but no, it is just as bad as it's competition. The plot is very weak and unbelievable. I was expecting something from a TV show or a movie from the 60's, but not a movie from the 90's. There are some good actors in this movie, but not enough to make this a good movie. I am surprised that Paramount had the balls to release this! I have never seen a worse movie.

I am a huge fan of the original "South Park." I loved the series when it was on Comedy Central. The show is hilarious, and it is one of the few shows that any adult will enjoy. It is way too funny for children to watch, and it is one of the few shows that can make adults laugh out loud (which is rare). The characters are great, and I love the voice acting. The show is constantly surprising, and I am always amazed at how much

 If you are a fan of the MST3K Show you will probably like this movie more than I did. But, if you are an empty-nest age parent looking for a (not so) mindless time-killer, I find it very hard to recommend. The characters are not very amusing, the writing is dully predictable and the premise is so ridiculously unbelievable that it takes away the fun of watching the movie. The movie is too long, the jokes are not clever enough, and the special effects are laughable. 3 stars only because it is a movie that MST3k-ers will probably like.

 This is a very good book and I think the movie was good too. But the "Killer" was very weak and when he picked up the telephone after all the killings, it was a pretty lame way to finish the story. It was a little too "Hollywood". My suggestions would be a better way to end the story and a better way to kill the killer. As it stands now, the guy is going to get away with it. The cinematography was good, but the acting was rather poor, and the sound was pretty bad. It was a little too "Hollywood" for me and I think the real killer could have been more creative in killing the old lady. I think the author would have been very happy with the film if they did not edit his story too much. The book is very good and it is a shame that the fan base did not get to see a good movie.

 In this movie, the director can't be bothered to make a point, let alone an entertaining one. The acting is only so-so, but the worst thing is how the movie seems to have been written by a 12-year old girl.<br /><br />A typical scene is this. Character X (who is full of himself, we find out later) is telling a story to Character Y (who is bored). Character X is talking about something he did and this is what he says:<br /><br />Character X: "I was on a job. I was hired to go and do this. I was hired to do that. But I was doing it for the money... I was doing it for the money..."<br /><br />Character Y, bored and waiting for something to happen: "Oh, okay.

 I was shocked when I saw the movie, because I thought that it was going to be a comedy. I thought that the "punch line" was going to be when he would reveal that he was from PETA, as he was always carrying a tomato on him, and would say "I'm from PETA, I'm here to help, please don't eat me." I thought the movie was funny because of how ridiculous it was. But, it had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was bad (although the guy who played the butler was good), the storyline was bad, and the only thing that was good was the "punch line" because it was so ridiculous. If you want to see a good comedy, see "Office Space", and if you want to see a bad comedy, see this.

 The first thing that I was puzzled about when I saw this movie was why it was so long. I have seen movies that have been longer than this movie, but I don't recall any of them being as long as this one was. I was also puzzled about the fact that there were virtually no characters that you cared about. There was a girl named Emily who was portrayed as being a sweet person, but it was hard to believe that she was really that nice. Overall, this movie was pretty boring, and I found it hard to care about any of the characters.

 This was not only one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it was one of the worst I've ever read. The dialogue was so bad my ears bled, and I'm a guy.

So, he reads the book, and one night he goes out to ask women out, and they all tell him they're not interested. He then goes to the
 I think I would have enjoyed the film more if I had had the opportunity to see a stream of the original material prior to viewing the movie. The movie was well acted and photographed, but there was just something missing. The original play was very funny, and I think this movie would have been much better if they had just stuck with the original. It's a great story, and it was just ruined by the addition of the "curse" of the Baudelaire children. The movie did make me want to read the books - which I can't find anywhere. I would have liked to read the books before watching the movie.

The movie is also confusing without a strong plot, as the plot is disjointed and unclear. There is also a very complicated story line, which is confusing.

The movie is not an accurate portrayal of the books. It is so different that I feel like I have read the "real" story, which is quite different.

I really really really wanted to like it - so much so that I added up the hours of my life I spent watching it - and the answer was ten.

I would have rated it higher, except that I felt that the movie was
 This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a big fan of the genre, but this one takes the cake. The storyline is horrible, the acting is terrible, and the CGI is obviously fake. The main character kills people by throwing a knife at them. What the heck is going on here. I do not understand how a movie like this got made. It is so bad, that I can't even make fun of it. I am actually doing a double take. I'm sorry, but this is not funny. This movie is so bad, that it will probably be one of the worst movies of the year. The only thing this movie has going for it is the characters. They are alright, but not even close to enough to save this movie.

 I don't often like silent films but I thought this was a good one. The cast is good, the plot is interesting, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. I particularly like the fact that the story is very loosely based on a real incident. There are some really well done uses of silhouette and black and white photography. If you're looking for a light, fun film, I'd recommend this one.

I wouldn't call it a "bad movie" because it's a movie with a good story, with interesting actors and actresses, this is the only positive thing I can say about this movie.<br /><br />I don't know who picked up this movie. I think it's a group of kids that are in their early 20s and are just trying to have fun and improve their low self-esteem by making a low budget movie. They also try to make a name for themselves by making "bad movies". This movie, although it looks like a bad movie, is not actually a bad movie. It's an average movie. It's not one of those movies that you sit down, watch and you say: "That was a really bad movie". It's a movie
 This is a completely idiotic movie. I don't like to use the term stupid, but this is the best way to describe this movie. I laughed out loud at a few scenes, including the part where the guy realized he was being followed. Then I realized that I was the only one laughing. I've heard it said that people who see this movie should see it as a comedy. It isn't. It's not even a bad comedy, it's just a bad movie. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is bad and the plot just doesn't make any sense. This movie had the potential to be so much better, but was squandered. If you want a good laugh, watch the SNL skit "Halloween Hijinks" instead. It's better than this movie ever will be.

 It is obvious that the script was written in a hurry, and with little or no thought about what it would actually be like to be a refugee.<br /><br />The story is pretty much the same as many others, a family flees a war torn country and ends up in a refugee camp. The main difference is that the film starts with the family already in a camp, and so the journey to Turkey is shown in the first twenty minutes.<br /><br />The film is not very well made. The characters are almost unbelievable and the actors seem to be phoning it in. It is pretty much a one sided story, and the viewer is left to fill in the blanks and make up their own mind.<br /><br />The one thing that saves the film is the fact that the director put in quite a bit of effort to put the viewer in the place of the refugees. Many scenes were shot in real refugee camps, and if you watch the film you can almost feel yourself being in the place of the refugees.<br /><br />The film is not a very good one, and I would suggest that if you only have a few minutes, and you want to see a film about refugees, then
 I am not sure that I understand why someone would want to see this movie. It is so bad that it is actually funny. This movie is so bad that it is actually funny. I guess the only way to know if you like bad movies is to watch bad movies. I really don't know how many times I laughed at how far this movie has gone. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it baffles me that so many people love it. There is no way that anything good could be said about this movie. Well, I lied. There is one good thing that could be said about this movie, and that is that it is so bad that it is actually funny. That is all though. I don't know if I can recommend this movie to anyone. I have said my piece, so I guess I will have to say good night.

The first time I saw this movie was at the New York Film Festival. I was so excited to see it, and I was so happy when I saw that it was playing. The title
 This is the first movie that I've seen that I actually thought was a waste of time. I don't know why I even wasted my time watching it. It doesn't even have a plot. I was hoping for a movie that was scary. I was hoping for a movie that actually had a plot. I didn't even understand what was happening throughout the movie. I was just sitting there waiting for it to end. I guess the only positive thing that I have to say about this movie is that the character of Maynard was funny, in a very dark way. I think that it should have been rated R. I'd recommend this movie to all my friends.

It seems like the movie is a joke. The movie is not scary at all. It is a movie for teenage girls who love horror movies.

horror, October 13, 2007

By Steve
 I, like others, was initially very excited to see a movie that, on the surface, appears to be a very interesting story. Initially, I was not disappointed. But then the movie evolved into a dull and tedious, if not ugly, piece of work. In the end, with all the unnecessary plot contrivances and the constant whining of the characters, the movie became a real chore to sit through. I honestly wanted to walk out of the movie theatre, but I settled for leaving early. That is how much I hated this movie. It is sad how it took a two star movie for me to get back on this site and give a review. All in all, I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not glad I wasted my time seeing it.

(this movie is based on a novel of the same name by Edward Rutherford)

A very good movie, with a beautiful cast and an excellent plot. The movie began a little slowly, but once it got into its groove, it was very good and a joy to watch. It's a wonderful movie with a lot of suspense and drama. A very good movie
 I found the movie trying to be very hard to follow and very slow. The movie is about a family who moves back to their old house and the kids have to get a new school and new friends. The movie isn't bad, but it is very boring. The movie is about a family who moves into a house that is haunted. The movie is about a girl named Amanda who moves into an old house. The movie is about a kid named Andrew that has to get used to being in a new school. I would give this movie a 3 out of 10. I think that kids could enjoy this movie but I don't think that adults would enjoy this movie too much.

Great Evil is Here...

Author: (peter-alexander_3@msn.com) from United States

I was sure the director and producer of this movie had seen the movie "The Exorcist", but the idea of this film is actually better than the actual movie "The Exorcist" was. The movie "Evil is Here" is about a boy named Andrew
 I saw this movie opening night, hoping it was going to be a terrible, campy, rip-off of THE CROW. I was so wrong! This movie was painfully boring and badly acted. The story was very predictable and there was no real tension or intrigue. Basically, it was just a long series of horrible events, with the bad guy getting away at the end. The only redeeming thing about the movie was the wonderful costumes and sets. They were phenomenal. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such incredible costumes, every scene was a visual treat. Unfortunately, I couldn't really enjoy them because the movie was so boring. For such a low budget production, it seems like they had a lot of money. It seemed like they could have at least put some effort into the script and the acting. I'm sorry, but I just don't see how this movie could be considered a horror film. I'm glad I went to the theater to see this movie, because I wouldn't have paid to see it on DVD.

I'm so glad I read the previous comments and saw that this movie actually won awards. I had no idea. I thought it was just a terrible, low-budget rip
 This is a very stupid movie. I thought that the movie was going to be about vampires, but it turned out to be about a guy who was possessed by a serial killer and a cop who wanted to get rid of him.<br /><br />I actually thought that the movie was pretty good, but the acting was awful. The plot was pretty good, but some of the dialogue had no sense to it and was very pointless.<br /><br />If you want to see a good movie, that you will laugh at, then I suggest trying out the movie "The Wedding Singer" or "Talladega Nights". They are both funny. If you want to see a good movie, that you will cry at, then I suggest trying out the movie "The Sixth Sense". It is a good movie, but it is very sad.

 If you have ever seen a movie with the name "The Spookies" in the title, do not get your hopes up that this will be an enjoyable movie. This movie is a rip-off of the 1980s show, "The New Adventures of The Spookies". The only difference is that these kids are supposed to be in the Civil Rights Era, and they are not spooky, they are precocious. The story is not very good, and the humor is utterly sophomoric. For example, during one scene, one of the girls is trying to use the bathroom, but she cannot get the lock open. The other girl says, "This is why I don't want to be in a mixed-race marriage." And so, the kids go and talk about that to the maid. Then, another scene has another girl get a little upset because she is not getting enough attention from her boyfriend. She goes to her friend, who is a boy, and asks him if he thinks her boyfriend is cute. He tells her he thinks she is cute. Then the other girl says, "He just doesn't like that I'm a girl." The other girl says back, "I know, but he doesn't like
 This was a movie that I saw in theaters and I don't remember much about it. What I do remember is that it was really bad. It was just an average movie that I didn't even think that it was worth my time to watch. I though that it was a movie that I could have done without. I don't remember anything about it besides the fact that it was a very average movie. I'm not sure if I would see the sequel because I don't remember anything about the movie. I don't think you will either unless you liked the first one.

I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10.

This movie was like a action movie but it was not even a good action movie. This movie was just a bad movie that was not even worth watching. I don't think you will like this movie even if you are a fan of the first one.

I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10.

I just watched this movie tonight and I didn't like it at all. I have seen this movie before and I didn't like it the first time that I saw it. I think that you will not like this movie even if you are a fan of the first
 I was one of the people who thought this had gone too far when the first trailer was released. Then the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" version was released, and I thought it was quite funny. Then I saw the full movie and...well...I feel like I've been had. The movie is pretty bad, but the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version makes this movie seem fun when it's not. They don't even keep the same plot, but the movie is so bad that it's not the same. I don't understand why they didn't just keep the first plot. The jokes are just so weak, and the movie is so bad that it doesn't even make any sense. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not even as bad as "The Wizard of Speed and Time", but that's saying something. I'm not sure how this movie got made, but it was a waste of time. Take the time to avoid this movie.

I give this movie a 0 out of 10.

"It's just a bunch of parts and a robot."
 I was pleasantly surprised by the good reviews this movie got, but I sure didn't get that impression. The plot was very confusing and the acting was horrible. I had to watch the movie over and over again to figure out what was going on. I have always wanted to see the "westward journey" but have never had the chance to. I think that I am going to give it a try now.

The film makers really should have taken the time to make their movie more understandable. If I was doing a movie about a western adventure, I would make my movie about the journey and leave out the parts about the people that were along for the ride. In the end, it would be much better.

I have a question for people who have seen this movie. Was the movie about the journey or about the people that came along for the ride?

I am just not sure.

I guess I should have done a little more research before I watched the movie. I am just not sure what the movie is about anymore.

It is not an awful movie, but I hardly think it is good either.

I give it a C-.

 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It is way too long. It is too slow. It is just boring and so unbelievably slow. The movie is not even worth seeing if you have any interest in watching it. I am a huge fan of the "Hangover" movies. I have seen all of them and love them all. This movie was just like all of the other "Hangover" movies except for the fact that this one was way too long and way to slow. The only thing I liked about it was that it had a little bit of the "Hangover" movies in it. I hate to say it, but I HATE the "Hangover" movies. I am just not a fan of them. They are way too overrated. They are way too boring and way too stupid. I don't agree with people who say the "Hangover" movies are so funny. They are not funny at all. They are just stupid and boring. There are way too many of them. They are just way too stupid. They are too stupid and way too boring. I don't know how people like these stupid and boring movies.

 This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's not just bad, it's awful. The plot is poorly developed, the acting is bad, the special effects even worse, and the storyline is ridiculous. It's as if a group of people basically got together and said, "Let's make a movie and make it look like it was made in the 80's". First of all, why would a person going on a vacation stay in a hotel that was built in the 1800's? Second, these people said they had been out at sea for two weeks. Two weeks? Last time I checked, it's a lot more than two weeks. Third, at the beginning of the movie, they said they would be getting there in a couple of days. If they were out at sea, they would have been there at least a week by now. The reason they were out at sea is because they ran out of fuel. How could they run out of fuel? They had 1500 gallons of fuel and they were out at sea. Making up these excuses made the movie even more ridiculous. If this is the best movie you can come up with, you are in the wrong business.

The film was made in the
 The premise of this movie is that the main character has a fear of heights. It doesn't matter if it's a building, or just a high place, he can't stand it. He is then forced to climb a mountain, which he is terrified of. Walking along the very top of the mountain, he sees a woman in a red dress. He thinks he sees her again, so he starts to climb down. That's when he sees her face in a puddle. He gets down safely and he thinks it's a sign that he should go back up the mountain to find her. Of course, he runs into people who know him from past experiences, which keeps him from doing so. He keeps seeing her face in this puddle, and he keeps going up to look for her. When he finally does, he finds her on the side of the mountain and he runs up to her and gives her a kiss on the cheek. A few minutes later, he wakes up in his bed. He realizes that he dreamt the whole thing. And he has a fear of heights. I have no idea what kind of movie this was, but it was terrible. The first part was like a soap opera, the second part was confusing
 I was looking for a good horror movie to watch tonight and i stumbled across this movie. I decided to give it a chance, i was actually surprised that i liked it. The acting wasn't the best, but i was actually surprised that this movie was actually pretty scary.<br /><br />The score was really good, and the movie is really slow and builds up the tension. The kills were not the best, but i was actually surprised that there was a lot of blood, and i was actually kinda scared. I was also surprised that this movie didn't have any nudity, if there was nudity it was just a little, but it was pretty good. I really recommend watching this movie.

 This movie is NOT (and please don't believe me if I say it is) a comedy. The only thing that is funny, is the fact that the main villain is yellow and has no nose, and the names of the actors. The movie's plot, as is with most movies, is not very interesting and relies on the actors. I would have to say that if you have to watch this movie and you are a fan of any of the actors, it would be worth your time. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this movie.

The movie is called "LOST IN SPACE" it was made in 1998. I don't know what the story is about, but this movie is hilarious! It's on the Sci-Fi channel, but go and buy the DVD, it's worth it!

 I was expecting a lot from this movie. I mean, it's got Megan Fox, who's one of the hottest chicks in Hollywood today. However, I was disappointed by this movie. It felt very low budget. I mean, the CGI looked like it was from the early 90's. And the acting...well, I can't believe Megan Fox was in this movie. She looks so fake in this movie. It's like she's playing a character. And I mean, the plotline was very predictable. The only good thing about this movie is that I think Megan Fox is smoking hot as hell. She can really act as well. I just wish she would be more natural in her roles. She's just not natural at all. I can't believe she was nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />In conclusion, I give this movie a negative 9. It's not worth watching.

 This movie is not about the Arabs or about Palestine. It's about the Israeli settlers. It's about the leaders in Israel and how they treat their people. It's about the Palestinians in the refugee camps and how they are treated by the Israelis. It's about the discrimination against the Arabs and the prejudice. The movie is supposed to be a comedy but I found it to be a very serious view of what happens to the Palestinians every day. I was so angry when the Arabs were treated like that. I was so angry that I felt like I wanted to go to the middle east and start a war with the Israelis. I was so upset at the way the Israelis are treated. This movie is very well done and it should be seen by everyone because it highlights the human rights abuses that go on in the middle east.

The acting is very good, but the plot is not that good. I felt that it could have been a little better. I felt like the actors had a hard time telling the story. The story seemed like it was just told to me. I did not feel like I was in the middle east with the people telling me about their lives. I felt like I was in the middle east with the people telling me
 I have a couple of friends who have seen this movie. I don't know why they are friends with me but they are. I can't decide if this movie was better than the movie that was made in the 80's, but I think it was. People are quick to criticize this movie and I think that is because they have not seen it. I have seen it and I think it is funny, even though I don't understand why they have to have all these animals around. I'm a big animal lover, but I know that some of these animals are going to get hurt or even die before long. I think the movie makers did a good job with the movie, but I think the real problem is that the animals can't do anything in the movie.

My recommendation for anyone who has not seen the movie is to rent it. I think that you will enjoy the movie.

4/10 for being funny.

4/10 for having animals.

10/10 for being a good movie.

8/10 for being better than the original.

3/10 for having animals that are not actors.

3/10 for having animals that can't do anything.

 This is a weird movie; I don't know what they were thinking when they made it. It's not scary, but it's not funny, either. It's just a bunch of uninteresting people wandering around, being boring and unlikable. The movie doesn't really have a plot, and it doesn't really have a point. If you watch this, you will think, "So what?" You might want to watch it again to make sure that I didn't just make that up. It's a waste of time and a waste of money.<br /><br />So, if you want to watch a movie that is boring, but not boring enough to stop you from watching it, watch this. If you're just looking for a good time, watch something else. This movie is just an exercise in boredom.

 I was expecting a good movie from Amole Gupte. The plot was interesting and I was expecting to see some good acting. I was wrong. The acting was so bad that I could not understand what the actors were saying or what the script was about. The plot was also confusing. I have read the book and it was very good so I did have some reference to the story. The movie was also boring and did not have any suspense. It was not worth paying money for a ticket.

The movie was very boring and had no suspense or drama. The acting was also very bad, unenthusiastic and unconvincing. It did not have any real comedy or drama.

 I just watched this movie and I found it to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. It tells the story of two Korean women, one a prostitute and the other a doctor, who are forced by the Japanese army to work in a military medical camp. The movie is a very long and drawn out film, but that's not really a problem because this film is so slow and boring. There is almost no action in the film, and the action that there is ends with one of the characters being raped by a Japanese officer. I don't know how they decided to make the film, but they should've set it in Korea instead of Japan. There are lots of stereotypes in the movie, such as the soldier with a "revolver" in the back of his pants. Why can't we get a movie that shows the incredible courage of the Korean people during the war? I understand that the filmmakers may have done this on purpose, but I don't care. I'm sick of seeing horrible films about Korea and the Japanese army. I'm sick of seeing these films that try to show the Japanese as the "good guys". I'm sick of seeing movies in which the Japanese army is portrayed as "heroes" or "
 I read the other reviews and was surprised at how good people thought this movie was. It was the worst movie i have ever seen. I don't know how they thought this movie deserved a '10' rating. If it was up to me i would give it a '0'. I don't know why anyone would want to make a movie like this. It was so boring and i wanted to fall asleep. The characters were uninteresting and the plot was really bad. I didn't really care about anybody in the movie and i felt like i was being told what to think about the movie. I don't know how the people who wrote the other reviews found this movie so good. It was just a bad movie. Don't waste your time and money on this one. A bad movie doesn't deserve a good rating.

 This is a terrible movie. It's as bad as the worst parts of "The Last Temptation of Christ". It is a complete waste of time. The director, who also wrote the script, should be ashamed of himself. It's a complete insult to the art of film. If you want to see a good movie, go rent "The Last Temptation of Christ". It's a wonderful film, and it has a lot to say about the meaning of God and faith and redemption, while this movie is 95% empty. The director of "The Last Temptation of Christ" was only in his early 30's when he made it. He's now in his 70's. Watching this film makes me feel old. This movie is insulting to the audience. It's a bad God, and a bad movie.

The Bible tells us that just as the Bible is inspired by God, so is our film. I wonder if the Bible inspired the Bible? If the Bible was inspired by God, why did it have to be rewritten?

If a movie is so bad that it is not even worth discussing, it means that it was created by someone with severe psychological problems. <br /><br />When the movie was over, my wife asked me if I was really sure about the movie. I told her that I was indeed sure and she asked me if I thought that the movie had been made in a movie studio.

 What in the Sam Hill is this piece of sh*t? This film is the worst thing that has ever been put to film. The plot is boring and pointless. The characters are lifeless and the dialogue is stupid.

 It all seems very odd, but I'm not sure what is going on here. I think the movie is supposed to be funny, but it's not. They just don't know how to make it funny. I don't know if it's the actors or the direction, but it's just not funny. On top of that, the movie is kind of slow. The plot isn't really thick, but it's not that hard to follow. I mean, there are the four main characters, but they all seem to be doing their own thing. The plot is not that interesting and it's not that deep. I would go see it, but I wouldn't call it a comedy.

 This film is absolutely terrible. I cannot understand why it has won so many awards. The acting is amateurish and the plot is atrocious. I had to sit through the whole film before I realised that the lead actor was French. The film makes it look as if it was made in France when it was actually made in Portugal as the language spoken is Portuguese. The two main characters are complete idiots. The story is very confusing and I found myself skipping whole scenes. I had to see the film to the end to find out what the film was about. I may not be a big fan of French cinema, but I do know what I like. I do not like this film.

I cannot understand why this film has won all these awards and I am sure, if I knew more about the film industry, I would be able to. I have seen some of the other films nominated for this award and I can say that "The Barbarian Invasions" is by far, the worst of the lot. I was expecting some good film-making from this film and, as it turned out, I was disappointed. The director, who is also
 I had a lot of trouble with this film. I cannot figure out why the director decided to make this film. Maybe he wanted to make a "big" film. Too bad this did not happen. I think the film took the wrong direction, and lost its direction. The American dream, the American dream is what this film is all about. The actors did not act, they just played around. It seems like these are not actors, but actors are just playing around. I don't know why the director did this. This is not acting, this is acting for the wrong reason.

I thought this film was about actors who are living in the middle east, but it is not. I was so disappointed. I did not like the acting, I did not like the directing, I did not like the script, I did not like the direction, I did not like the ending, I did not like the music, I did not like the cinematography, I did not like the editing, I did not like the camera angles, I did not like the sound, I did not like the camera work, I did not like the lighting, I did not like the costumes, I did not like the hair, I did not

 I was too young to remember this "classic" from the mid 1970's. But I do remember it as being one of the worst movies I ever saw, including the ones like "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". I'm only 15 and I can't see that many movies, but I have watched them all and this one is really terrible. I can't believe I actually watched this. My dad loved it and I've seen him watch it over and over. But I couldn't do it. I was so scared, so scared of the whole thing. This is a movie that you have to have seen before to get the full effect of it. I'm glad it's out on DVD, but I won't be buying it. I still have the original VHS tape. I don't know what to make of this movie.

1/5

**SPOILER**

I didn't even get to the part that makes this movie so bad. It was the part where the girls are in the basement, picking up bottles, etc. It was the part where the girls are in the cellar, doing the things that were suppose to be done. It was the part where the girls are walking around the house,
 This was the worst film I have ever seen. Not only was it poorly written and acted, but it was also insultingly bad. The only good thing about this movie was the acting. I guess if you have to have a cheap horror movie, then this is it. If you have to have a good horror movie, then this is not it.

Rating: 1/10

*** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

The acting was horrible in this movie. The acting was so bad that it made me want to turn it off and watch something else. I didn't think that it was bad acting, I just thought that it was too bad to be real.

The story was also bad. I mean, what's the point of having a movie with a girl that can't do anything. She's just a girl that gets raped. She doesn't even get a gun. I don't know what they were thinking, but I found it insulting.

The characters were also very annoying, and had no real personality. I was really surprised when I heard the director say that some of those characters were based on real people. I guess, if they really were real
 I have to say that I was very disappointed in this movie. I was very excited to see it, and even though I didn't know anything about the story I was interested in seeing it. I saw it at the theatre, (which is my normal way of seeing movies) I was disappointed by the fact that I had to pay to see it. It wasn't a very good film, but I still would have liked to give it a chance. I was very much disappointed by the fact that the movie was not really a story but more of a compilation of different stories. I give it a two out of five, because it was a good idea, it just didn't turn out very well.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes stories and drama and wants a movie that will make you think.

 I rented this movie for the first time about a year ago and I've been waiting for a chance to write a summary to avoid having to watch it again. I'm sure that a lot of people will tell you that "The Haunted House" is a classic, but trust me, this movie is definitely not worth your time. There are so many better horror movies out there and I can't understand why they didn't do anything more with this story. The acting is terrible, the special effects are laughable and the plot is nothing more than a stupid excuse to have the title character run around and kill people. The movie is basically just a bunch of people that are killed by a crazy woman dressed like a clown and I think that the only reason that this movie has gotten so much praise is because it was made in the early 80's and it's considered one of the best slasher movies ever made. I just don't get it. All of the characters are stupid, boring, and obnoxious and the only redeeming quality about this movie is that the killer is a beautiful woman. She's dressed like a clown and she runs around killing people, so I guess that makes up for the rest of the movie. I give this movie two out of
 Now, as I said, I like this movie. It's a fun, light-hearted film which plays out like a comic book. I like the 'Batman' games, and this was an enjoyable film on the same level. And of course, Christopher Walken's performance is the best, as usual. I'd enjoy watching this again, or even seeing it again. But it would've been nice if it had gone a different direction. It seems that the film is almost a parody of the entire genre of heroes battling each other, and that's fine. The problem is that it never goes anywhere. The film just keeps repeating the same thing over and over. It's a good film, but it's not very good. It's got plenty of comedy and pathos, but it's not very deep. The film's not likely to have changed anyone's opinions of the genre. But it's still an enjoyable film, and one which I enjoyed.

 This movie is a bad example of movie making. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you think you are going to be entertained by this movie, you are going to be very disappointed. It is a bad movie of a bad movie. If you see this movie, you will be very angry and upset, not entertained. It is a very poorly made movie. I don't know how anyone could make a movie so bad. I am very upset that this movie was made. I feel that the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves for making such a bad movie. It makes me so mad that I cannot watch this movie. It is a waste of time. This movie is about a guy who is dying, and he finds two people that he thinks can help him with his cancer. He goes to a doctor, and the doctor tells him that he has cancer and he will die. The doctor tells him that he has three months left to live. The doctor tells him that he should go to a hospital that has the best doctors in the world, and then he will get his life back. The doctor says that he can have the best doctors in the world. He goes to the hospital and he gets
 The story is something you can find in other films, the only difference being that the film has a boring and uninteresting script, the acting is good, but it's not enough to save this film. The film is also very silly and boring, and it's also very badly directed. The film doesn't have a good ending, and the whole film is boring. I really don't have much to say about the film, but I have to say that it's not one of the worst films ever. It's just bad.

 This movie is terrible. The characters are dumb, and the plot makes no sense. I have seen worse movies, but this one is awful. I can't believe they made such a bad movie. I mean, how many "action" sequences can you have in a film? There is one-too-many, and the plot is a complete waste of time. I usually like movies about the military and war, but this one is a waste of brain cells. I wouldn't even give this film to my worst enemy. I'm sorry, but I don't think I can recommend this film to anyone.

 I can't believe this movie got such a high rating on IMDb and on Rotten Tomatoes. I tried to watch this movie with high expectations, but it was just a complete disappointment. After the credits rolled, I couldn't believe how boring this movie was. I thought this would be a good movie, but I was wrong. The acting was really bad, and the story was just awful. I am from Canada and I couldn't believe how bad the accents were. So what if the actors could speak fluent English and French, that doesn't make a good movie. The acting was so bad I had to turn the TV off. I thought the movie would be better than it was, but it wasn't. I think I would have rated this movie a 0, but I can't. My suggestion is that if you watch this movie, you will get bored and turn it off. The only good thing about this movie is that it's not based on a book, and the acting was pretty good.

 I must admit that I was not a huge fan of the original film. I thought it was a very cute and funny film, but nothing special. But I thought I would give the sequel a chance to see if it was a different film or not. I must say I was very suprised. I was expecting a much more serious, dark film. The film was very funny and an enjoyable film to watch. It seemed to keep the same fun atmosphere of the first one. It is a pretty solid film and I would recommend it to all fans of the original. A good sequel.

 I have too many horror movies to really rank them, but this is definitely one of the worst. It's not because it's not well made, or even well acted. It's just that I can't believe anyone would believe this movie. It's like a rehash of most of the other movies out there. The guy can't get a job due to his past crimes, so he goes to a small town for a fresh start. He gets a job that requires him to kill people, and he does. The townsfolk start talking about how this person is a killer and that he should be hanged. He's then forced to kill the sheriff and his family, and the townspeople's beliefs are shattered. They want revenge for what he has done. This movie is so stupid, and it's over the top. I don't understand why anyone would want to watch this movie. It's so unbelievable. The only reason I don't give it a 1 is because it's not really that bad. It's just that there are way too many movies out there like this. So I give it an average 2.

I was hoping that I would see a good movie this week, and this is not it.


 When I was a kid, I loved this movie. Since I watched it in the 70's, I have been a big fan of the movie. I have always wondered if the movie was based on a true story. Well, I found out that the movie is based on the true story of a teacher named John Krasinski who in real life was a teacher and the father of Jim Krasinski. In 1995, a movie called "A Perfect Murder" was made about the murder of John Krasinski's wife. That movie is also based on a true story, that of John Krasinski and his wife. I think this movie is good as a movie but it is not good as a true story. I also think that it is a good movie just to see how a real murder case would look like.

I give it a 10/10, I watched it and was amazed at how close the movie was to the real story.

10. A Perfect Murder

A perfect murder is a good movie that shows how a murder case is investigated. It has some great actors in it and it has some romance in it.

<br
 What is it that makes Hollywood so easy to hate? Does it have to do with Hollywood's connections to the government? Or is it Hollywood's complete contempt for its audience? I don't know, but it sure as hell doesn't have to do with the quality of the entertainment. Of course, the fact that the movie is terrible isn't the only reason to hate it.<br /><br />It's awful. It's not just awful storytelling, though it is. It's also awful acting. It's just so bland, so shallow, so predictable. I don't know if the movie's only noteworthy aspect is that it's a sequel to a sequel to a sequel to a sequel, but it's certainly the only interesting thing about it. The plot is a cookie-cutter retelling of the first movie, and the characters are all flat, boring, and utterly uninteresting. The acting is even worse. The only interesting thing about this movie is that it stars a woman I like, Nicole Eggert. Otherwise, the main actors are all bland and uninteresting. Not to mention, this movie deserves the lowest rating I can give it. The acting is so bad (even for a movie rated PG), the plot is
 I don't know what all the hype is about this movie, but I found it to be slow, boring, and a little too much like a video-game. I must have been in a coma when I watched it. I've seen the original flick so I can't be that easily impressed. The original movie was a very well thought out, funny, and original tale that was very entertaining. I think that the only thing that comes close to the original is the cartoon. I think that this movie is a waste of time. I don't recommend that you rent or buy it, unless you are a die hard fan of the original.

After seeing it a couple of times, I realized that it is nothing but a rip-off of a dog movie called A Dog's Life. I watched it with a friend, and we both thought that the movie was pretty lame.

 This movie was so bad. I think the only reason why I didn't throw it out was because I taped it off the television, and it was kind of funny at times, but it really wasn't. It was a total waste of time, and the acting wasn't even that great. I hate to say this, but I have no idea why anyone would like this movie. I would have rather watched a video of a blowjob than watch this. The only thing that kept me watching was thinking it would get better. I am not sure why the studio made this movie, since it was so horrible.

 I had been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for so long, and I was so excited to see it. But, it was a big let down. I was expecting a much better movie, and it was not worth seeing. I was also very disappointed with the casting. I was expecting better. The only thing that I found good about this movie was the story line, but it was completely ruined by the actors. I thought that the story was very good, but the acting was very bad. All the actors just looked so fake. I couldn't believe that people actually paid to see this movie. I would never pay to see a movie that looked like this, and I would not recommend anyone to see this movie. If you are looking for a good movie, I would suggest that you look at another movie.

The movie was very boring to me. I have seen better movies. I have seen better movies, and I would not recommend anyone to see this movie.

I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10. There are so many better movies out there, and I would never recommend this movie to anyone.

I would also like to add that I am not a big fan of movies,
 A good example of the overuse of violence. There are so many scenes where it is easy to see the editing has been rushed in an attempt to distract the viewer from the lack of plot. The acting is poor and the story is not too strong - the only reason it is getting one star is because of the few good scenes. Not a recommended film.

The plot is fairly weak with the main character being a cop who lives with his mother, and he is at odds with his mother over the issue of violence. He is also at odds with his boss and a local gangster. The violence is extreme and he is forced to go on a killing spree to prove he is not like his father. I found the acting to be poor, the plot is weak and the violence is excessive.

This film is a cross between LA Confidential, Scarface and the Godfather, but it does not work as well. It is about a cop who is forced to kill for revenge, but there is no real plot to catch your imagination. The film is too long and there is not enough to hold your interest.

The acting is poor, some of the dialogue is corny, and the plot is weak. I was
 I was expecting more from this movie, but I found it both boring and sad.<br /><br />It's about a girl who lived in a small town in the south. She had a very abusive father and a mother who was just not there. She had no one to care about but herself and when she got older, she was raped. She wasn't able to cope with it, so she ran away. Then a few years later, her mother got really sick and she went back home to take care of her. Then she went back to the prison and she got hired as a nanny for the daughter of the warden. Then she found out that she had a baby. The new baby was a little boy and her baby was a girl.<br /><br />In conclusion, it was very sad and boring. The movie is about the girl's life at such a young age, but she's not even in her teens. I think the story is about something like that, but it's about the girl's life when she's quite older. The story is about her life at the age of 12.

I think it's about her life when she's 14 or so. I was really disappointed when I
 First of all, as you probably already know from the comments/reviews already submitted by some of the people below, this film is not a sequel to the movie 'Fatal Attraction' (which was a success and has a cult following). It's a so-called 'parody' of the kind of movies people like myself (who are not really into the whole 'sadistic film' thing) like to watch. So that's not really a problem. But the fact is that this is a really poor film, and that everyone who has any sense of taste should avoid it. It's so stupid, and so boring and so stupidly made, that I'd say it's a joke. The plot is absolutely idiotic, the acting (by all the characters) is atrocious, and the plot is not even possible - which makes the whole thing ridiculous. I think the director should have been given a real life-sentence for making this film. And the fact that the movie has a few good points (like the first 20 minutes) doesn't change the fact that its a bad movie completely. Bad, bad, bad.

4/10

 I was on a long plane flight and was looking for a good movie. I spotted this on the plane. I saw about 10 minutes and it was AWFUL. All the actors were terrible. The dialogue was terrible. I was really disappointed. I wanted to see a good comedy but this was not it. I was really disappointed. I was hoping to have a good time with the rest of my plane ride but I was just bored. I should have known it was going to be bad when it was called "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum". Don't waste your time. It was horrible.

 I was really looking forward to this movie and it was a shame to see how bad it was. The movie was nothing but a badly made and acted piece of crap. The story is nothing special and the acting was even worse. The only good thing in this movie is the girls. I am a huge fan of Jennifer Connelly, but she doesn't do anything in this movie. She looks like a poor man's Jodie Foster. The other two girls are okay, but not very good. The guy playing the lead was okay, but the guy playing his brother was just awful. He was so bad that you couldn't even laugh at his jokes because he was just so bad. The other actors were okay, but nothing special. I would say that I was very disappointed in this movie.

I would give this movie a 1 out of 10. The movie is so bad that it is not worth the time to watch it.

 The first half of this film is slow, boring and not interesting. The second half is ok, but the first half is still the worst part of the movie. My advice - skip the first half and watch the second half only.

<br /><br />The story is about a guy who is in love with a girl. Guess what - the girl falls in love with someone else. The guy is a jerk anyway, so his love was never really genuine. The ending is pretty strange, but the rest of the movie is pretty bad.

<br /><br />If you are looking for a romantic comedy, watch the original "Bridget Jones's Diary". That movie has much more charm and it's much more interesting.

<br /><br />4/10 for the first half, 3/10 for the second half.

 I think the actors do a fine job of playing their characters. I just was very disappointed in the story line. I also found it interesting that my husband and I were sitting at the same restaurant watching this movie. We both were very bored. The story line went on forever. I can understand that the writers wanted to get their point across, but I thought the movie dragged on too long. My husband and I just watched the movie because we had nothing better to do, but the movie was just not very good. It was obvious that the writers of this movie do not know how to weave a good story line.

I think the movie could have been much better if they would have left out the "beating" scene. It did not have anything to do with the story line at all. All of a sudden it just happened and I was very disappointed.

It just seemed like a bunch of people sitting around talking about their problems and what was wrong with the world. I did not care about any of these characters. I just wanted them to get to the point.

This movie seems to be a trend in movies today. They start out with a good idea, but the movie just does not go anywhere. I
 A very weak story about a lost little girl, a boy she meets, a mother who wants to get her back and a creepy old man who is out to get them because he is jealous of the boy. I don't recall the last time I saw a movie that was so boring and had so many stupid scenarios and unexciting characters. This movie has no point and I am hoping that the person who wrote this movie is not able to see it or else he is going to see the movie about the guy who wrote this movie. This movie is not worth it. I give it a 0/5. I hope you liked my review. I have a big mouth and I need to get some sleep.

 I saw this movie when I was a kid and I still remember it. I thought it was really weird stuff.

There was no horror in this movie, no suspense, nothing. The acting was awful, and all the actors were trying to be funny. The only actor I liked was the one who played the little boy. He was the only one who tried to make this movie a little scary, and it was not working. <br /><br />The plot was so stupid, I don't even remember what the movie was about. I remember that the kid said that he had made a mistake and that he didn't want to meet his father. And then...nothing.

I don't even remember what happened to the little boy, or what happened to the father. All I remember is that the kid met his father and they
 First off, I am not a fan of the genre of horror movies, so I was not expecting to enjoy this movie. But I was a bit disappointed by how it turned out. The acting was good, but it was not scary. The storyline was decent, but the action was not that thrilling. The only thing this movie had going for it was the nice scenery, but then again, it is a horror movie, so that is not the point. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants a scary movie, but if you want to see a movie that is not bad, but is not worth your time, you may want to rent this movie.

 I was in the mood to watch a movie with a lot of action and just one guy, so I saw this. I was disappointed.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was decent. It had some good action scenes, but the story was fairly thin. The characters were fairly underdeveloped and the movie did not build on itself. The second half of the movie was what made me quit watching. There were fights and stuff, but the movie lacked the focus it needed. It just kept going on and on. The ending was a little too abrupt. I was expecting a lot more from the ending.<br /><br />The movie might be good for people who want to see a lot of action and a little story, but I would not recommend it for anyone looking for an intelligent, well written movie.<br /><br />Grade: C

 It seems the filmmakers wanted to make a "true" story about the Manson family, but didn't want to get into the psychological aspects of the case. It shows in the casting of the female lead, which is about all that's realistic about this film. The acting is poor and the story is utterly unbelievable. The film is so utterly unbelievable that it actually starts to come off as being a parody. It would have been better to leave it as a documentary.

 I was really looking forward to this film. I was hoping for a film that was similar to the original film from the 70's. A film that was taking place in the future, with a teenage girl's journey to find out who she is. The film was very slow, and when it was action it was really cheesy. I was really looking foward to the last 10 minutes of the film. I was like, finally! The film was very disappointing. The best part of the film was the trailer. I would search the internet for a trailer, just to see what it was going to be like. The film was extremely predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen, and it was disappointing. The ending was very disappointing. The ending was all about how the girl was going to find out who she was. It didnt really give any insight on what she was, or if she was going to be happy or not, or anything. I really hope this film does better then it did.

 I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon, but I hated this movie. I was expecting some dark comedy, but instead I got a dark comedy that wasn't funny. The worst part is that it's not even a funny dark comedy, it's just a sadistic comedy that's self-indulgent and pretentious. The jokes are all about making the characters look bad and being mean to the audience. The "dark comedy" is all about the characters being mean to each other, even the ones that aren't supposed to be mean to each other. It's like if "The Hangover" were a comedy. I can't believe anyone thought this was funny. If you want a good dark comedy, watch "The Hangover" or "Shaun of the Dead." If you want a good dark comedy that's funny, watch "Clerks" or "The Cable Guy." I guess "The Devil's Rejects" is not a dark comedy, so I guess that makes "Ghost World" and "American Psycho" the only other dark comedies, and I would say that those two are equally as good.

 The film was not as funny as I was expecting,it was more of a romantic comedy,it was also very slow,the first hour of the film was very boring,it was just plodding along,it was far too long and it was not that funny.I think the film would have been better if it had been trimmed down by 30 minutes,it was not the right length for a comedy.It was also not that funny,it was just not funny.It had some funny moments but they were few and far between and they were not enough to make up for the fact that it was a very slow film.The film would have benefited alot if it had been shorter,it was not funny and it was dull and slow.I do not think you should waste your money on this film,it was boring and slow and it was not funny.

 I'd heard a lot of good things about the first season of "The West Wing", so I went ahead and ordered the entire series on DVD. I have been greatly disappointed.<br /><br />One of the problems with "The West Wing" is that it's a show that makes you feel something. It's a show that makes you think, and it's a show that you're glad you watched in the first place. "The West Wing" is a show that makes you feel something, but it's a show that makes you feel something that you can't quite put your finger on. It's like a mystery, and I like mysteries. The problem is that I can't figure out what the mystery is.<br /><br />The thing that I can't figure out is how the creators of the show were able to turn a small political office in a little town in Vermont into a show that's so highly regarded. I want to like the show, I really do, but every time I watch it I'm disappointed. I don't know whether I should blame the actors (who are great, and I'd love to see them in other roles), the writers, or the producers, but I can't seem to
 If a movie is going to be set in the '80s, it should at least try to look like the '80s. This movie doesn't even try. It's so bad that I can't see how they could have ever made a sequel. The acting is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The camera work is terrible. The editing is terrible. The script is terrible. I hate to say it, but I don't think it was even directed by a director. I assume that the director was directing the movie while they were on the set, so they just put out the movie without a real director. This is the most horrible movie I have ever seen. I'm sure the director was trying to make the movie look like a campy '80s movie, but it just looks like a bad low-budget '80s movie. As bad as it is, it does have some redeeming features. The music is pretty cool. The first time I rented this movie, I was at Blockbuster when I saw a bunch of old VHS tapes that were being thrown out. I picked up this one because it was the only movie with the word "Shocker" on the cover. The cover showed a wooden stake
 I'm sure that I'm not the only person in the world who has had the misfortune to see this classic (if I'm not I'll do my best to be), but I must say that it is a terrible film. It may have been up to the standards of the time, but it's still horrible. The plot is ludicrous, the acting is terrible, and the characters are one-dimensional. The only characters that are not completely uninteresting are the two guys who are fighting. That is the only part of the film that I enjoyed.<br /><br />If you want to see a film that is actually good, try Raging Bull or The Godfather.

I'm a huge fan of the original Rocky. And I'm a fan of the original Rocky II. And I'm a fan of Rocky III. But this particular installment of the Rocky series is the worst film I've ever seen. I'm not sure if it's the worst movie ever made (I
 I rented this movie from the video store and was a big fan of Joan Collins, so I was expecting to like this movie. It's not a terrible movie, it's just extremely slow and boring. The plot is repetitive, the acting is stilted and the dialog is painfully bad. There is also a lot of nudity, which I would have liked to see if the film had been better. The ending is also pretty bad - it's just not clear what exactly happened. I really wanted to like this movie, but it's just dull and slow and doesn't really have any redeeming qualities.

It's a beautiful film, and has one of the most perfect opening sequences I've ever seen. I really enjoyed it, but it is fairly slow. The plot is fairly complicated, but it's easy to follow.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I do not know how many people like this movie - but I would not recommend it to anyone. I can't believe the people who thought this movie was great. I loved the first couple of episodes of the TV show, but this movie was a disgrace. I thought the lead actors were horrible. I was amazed that this movie got a PG-13 rating. I don't understand how that can be true. The movie is so bad that I'd rather watch a PG-13 movie than this one. There are a lot of other good movies out there that are rated PG-13 that
 This movie is all right. The subject matter is great, the cast is excellent and the acting is superb. The story line is great, the characters are interesting and the scenes are incredibly well done. I thought the director did a good job in filming the movie. However, the acting is just too over the top and unbelievable. Some of the scenes just didn't ring true and the situations just seemed too contrived. Not to mention, I just don't think the acting was that good. There were just too many times when I found myself just shaking my head and thinking to myself, "Really, this again?" I think that when a movie is so over the top that it's unbelievable and unrealistic, it can be a little hard to take. However, for some reason I just couldn't stop watching it. Perhaps it was because the subject matter was so interesting. I guess I just had to see how this all ended up.<br /><br />I will say that I wasn't sure what to expect with the special effects. I know that this was a low budget movie, but I was really impressed with the special effects in this movie. It was really well done and the attention to detail was well worth the watch.<br /
 This movie was so boring, it was hard to watch it. I know that the movie was based off of a true story, but I can't bear to watch it. I had to force myself to watch it. I really wanted to like this movie, but it just didn't work. The acting was okay, but the story was terrible. I cannot believe that this movie was a box office hit. It was just terrible. The movie kept giving me the feeling that the people that made this movie had no idea what they were doing. I am sorry, but I have to give this movie a 0 out of 10, and I rarely do that.

***SPOILERS***

The movie starts out with a young boy and young girl who are brother and sister. They go home with their parents, and their father gives the little boy a toy. What I found funny is that he gives him the toy, and then he gives his sister a Barbie. The boy is playing with his toy, and then he is hit by a car. We find out that the boy is dead. The father is distraught, and we find out that the little girl was hit by the same car that hit the boy. She died not long
 The acting was terrible. The cinematography was terrible. The movie was just plain bad. It was so bad that I didn't even bother to watch the end. The premise was very poor and the movie was just plain bad.

The acting was awful. The movie was just plain bad. I can't even remember what it was about. I think it was about a girl that's trying to be a boy. But the guy she's poor with is a big jerk as well.

 I've been a fan of horror for as long as I can remember, but I've never seen a film that has left me so disappointed in all my years of watching movies. Not only was the movie cheap and poorly executed, it was extremely dull. The acting was horrible, the characters were boring and the storyline was even worse. I had so much hope for this movie, but they blew it by not only making it boring but by making it so stupid. I mean, what were they thinking when they made this movie? It was just a bunch of bad ideas thrown together. I understand that you want to make a movie that will scare the viewers and make them cry, but this movie did neither. There were no jump scares, no blood, no guts and no scares whatsoever. I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they made this movie, but it was a terrible film and one of the worst of all time. I'm not saying that it is bad because of the fact that it is a Halloween movie, but because of the fact that it was just plain boring and weird. If you are looking for a horror movie that will make you jump, this is not it. All I can say is don't waste your
 These are 2 recent movies I rented from Blockbuster. The 1st was called "The Elephant Riders" and is about some US soldiers in Iraq. They are ambushed and have to use all their skills and teamwork to survive, in a scene that leaves no doubt that they are US soldiers. The 2nd was called "The Trail Masters" about a mountain man and his 2 sons who lead a family of mountain men and seem to be the "family" of the mountain man who is the 2nd movie's main character. The 2 main characters have a very dysfunctional relationship and it's clear they are not living in the same house and they both seem to be acting out a scene that they are rehearsing in their heads. This is not a subtle movie and the writing is very bad. It's not that the characters are that bad, but the writing is so bad you can't believe anyone would write this. I watched it because one of the characters is a mountain man and I always like to try to find out how they did it and where they did it. I came up empty. I know this is a common thing to do, but I was surprised at how bad it was.

If you like a LOT of action and
 I have seen this film several times, and I think the way the actors speak, the way the characters act, and the overall storyline of the film is so cheesy that it must be a joke. The acting is worse than a bad acting student film. The dialogue is unbelievable. The acting is so bad that it is hard to watch the film. I like to watch good acting, but this is not good acting, it is bad acting. I think this is a rip off of a bad Sandra Bullock movie. I think the director of this film must have been so heavy into drugs that he thought he could make a good film. I have never seen a film like this. It is so bad that I cannot believe that it is real. I give this film a thumbs down.

 I don't usually laugh at movies like this, but I did with this one. It wasn't clever, but it had a good cast, and it was sort of predictable...<br /><br />The girl was cute and the father was okay - the kid was okay, too, but he was the one who ruined the movie for me. He was the one who thought he was cool and smart by revising all the scenes.<br /><br />Even the best-looking guy in the movie was a let-down, because he was just an actor's actor who could have been in a movie about a guy who can't get a date.

<br /><br />This movie deserved a better rating, but I didn't have enough of a stomach to rate it lower than 2.

 I'm not one to knock on a film where a well-known actor is involved. In fact, I'll even go as far to say I really enjoyed the first two Son of the Mask movies. But I don't understand why they had to make a third one. I mean, the first two were so good, why make another one? So what if the first two were good, we all know that. Why not just leave it at that and make this a series of television episodes? I tried to watch it once, and it sucked! It wasn't even funny. It was just a waste of time and money. I've even heard that the first two made over a hundred million dollars, but I'm sure the third sucked so much money it lost its appeal. If you like Son of the Mask, then by all means, go see it. If you don't, then don't. If you are a fan of the first two, then rent it and make up your own mind.

I give the film a 9/10, though it's a lot closer to a 10. The film is very funny, and is probably one of the better
 This is an amazingly bad movie. The dialog during the 'inside joke' scenes is so bad you wonder why they didn't just hire comedians to do them. There's some of the most stupid acting that I've seen in a long time in this movie. There is a scene where they are having a conversation and one of the characters says: "The thing is, I don't think I've ever been able to prove anything to you." Another character says, "What are we talking about?" and the first character replies, "What were we talking about? I don't know." I felt like I was watching a bad episode of the late night TV show. The movie seems to have a lot of old references but they are so badly done that you lose track of what they are referencing. The only thing that made me sit through this movie was the scene where a character gets hit by a car. The best thing about this movie is that it's so bad. If you like bad movies, pick this up. It's a rare gem in the world of bad movies.

 I saw this movie during a visit to London. The plot is convoluted and a little weird. However, it's not completely stupid and contains some good acting and a little bit of nudity. The plot revolves around a couple of teenagers who get in to a car accident, which kills their best friend. Now they want revenge and find the man that killed him, who is a big celebrity. The plot gets a little bit crazy at times, but at least the acting is good and there are some surprises. In the end, it's a little bit creepy, but not completely so. I don't know how the movie was received in the US, but I think it's not a bad movie to watch.

 I watched this movie expecting it to be bad. I had seen a couple of other reviews and they were all negative. They were spot on.<br /><br />This movie should have gone straight to DVD! I was bored out of my mind. The acting was atrocious and the characters were completely unbelievable. I kept thinking "is this going to be one of those movies where they get thrown out of a window?" or "I wonder if the cops will come in and shoot everybody?"<br /><br />I was thinking about giving it a 2, but I'm giving it a 1 because it's better than the 3. It's worse than the 1.

 I had never heard of this movie... but it is listed as a "cult classic". I am sorry to say that I have never heard of it either, but it is difficult to believe that it is a cult classic. Perhaps it is a "so bad it is good" kind of movie.<br /><br />The movie is so bad it is unbelievable. The jokes are so bad they are funny. The acting is so bad that the actors are funny. The movie is so bad it is funny. The story is so bad that the story is funny. The soundtrack is so bad it is good. The movie is so bad it is good. We are so excited that we are watching the worst movie ever made that we have a good time. The good thing about "The Room" is that it is just plain terrible. It's not a good movie. It's not a cult classic. It's just plain terrible. It is so bad that it is funny. <br /><br />We are not recommending this film, we are just saying that we think it is so bad that it is good. It is so bad that it is good. You should see it simply because it is so bad that it is good.
 You get the idea that this movie was made by a group of actors who had all had a few drinks. They were probably in the same bar where they were filming the movie. In some ways, I think that even in a drunken state, these actors would have known enough to know this movie was trash. Even if they were drinking wine, there was no way that they would have ever thought of making a movie like this. After all, who would want to watch a movie about a bunch of losers? The only reason that I watched this movie was because it was free. I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised just how bad it was. There were some funny moments, but overall it was pretty much a train wreck.

I think that this movie was made as a joke by a bunch of drunks. They wanted to make a movie that would show people how bad they were at acting. They filmed it in a bar so that they could keep getting paid. The end result is a movie that is made by people who have no idea how to act.<br /><br />I won't recommend this movie to anyone.

http://www.imdb.com/title/
 This is a good example of why you shouldn't make a horror film more than two hours long. The plot is so predictable that the only suspense is to see who gets killed next. I don't believe in ghosts, but I do believe in movies that are entertaining, and this one is not. I'm not sure why everyone seemed to love this film. If you're expecting a good scare from this movie, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a good story, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting to laugh at the "gag" lines (which are mostly un-funny), you will be disappointed. This movie is a waste of time and money, unless you're just looking for a good time.

 I have watched this movie about 20 times, and i dont think it's funny AT ALL... this movie is just completely boring and stupid, I think the main actors in this movie were bored to death, because all they did in this movie was that they tried to look cool and funny because they had no real characters in them.. the thing that i hate the most about this movie is that it's not funny AT ALL.. i mean, i guess most people can deal with a movie that's not funny, but if it's not funny, then why make a movie like this in the first place? I am only giving this movie a 2 out of 10, because it is not funny AT ALL... this movie makes me regret ever watching it.. if you have watched this movie, and you are a big fan of this movie, then i beg you to please send this to the people who made it.. you can send it to: <a href="http://www.thedark.com">www.thedark.com</a> to the people who made it.. they will appreciate what you have done.. please do it, because this movie is just completely boring, and stupid, and silly, and completely and completely pointless
 While I agree that this movie could have been better, I did like it. The major problem I had with the movie was the acting. The actors did a good job with their roles but I believe that the movie could have been much better if the director chose to use better actors. The biggest problem I had with the acting was the fact that the acting gave the movie a very amateur look. The acting just didn't match the type of movie that it was trying to be. The movie itself was pretty good. It was very enjoyable. The movie had a lot of suspense and mystery in it. Although the acting could have used some work, the plot of the movie was pretty good. I liked the fact that the plot was not too complicated. I would have liked to see more of the plot unfold. The director could have used a little more creativity in the movie. The plot of the movie was somewhat predictable. The plot lacked a little subtlety. I was not surprised by the plot twists. The plot of the movie was not well developed. I wish that the plot of the movie had been developed more. The plot was pretty decent. I was not expecting the ending to be as it was. The ending was pretty disappointing. The movie
 I found this movie to be very boring and uninteresting. There were times when I could barely stand to watch it. The acting was bad and the story was even worse. The movie was a total waste of time. I won't recommend this movie to anyone.

 I found this movie to be a complete waste of time. It's no wonder that the movie went straight to DVD. Is it too much to ask for a movie to flat-out be funny? As it is, even the most outlandish situation has to have some exaggeration or at least some kind of laugh factor. You're talking about a guy who can't get a date, whose parents have a black sheep. This is going to be a comedy of some sort. You get a couple of laughs here and there, but it's not enough to make you think that it's worth it. The humor doesn't even flow naturally. There are plenty of scenes that should have had some sort of comedy reaction, but it just doesn't happen. This is the kind of movie where you need to be able to laugh at a joke and not just be thinking about it. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that it's not good enough to be worth seeing.

The movie is about a guy who thinks he's the king of the world. He goes on a date and gets the best girl in the world only to find out that she's actually a mermaid. He's not able to even get a date to the
 I saw the first episode of this new show, and I'm very disappointed. I used to love this show back in the day, but I guess the old days of it been cancelled, and now it's on again. It's funny, but I'm now in the middle of the show, and it's not funny anymore. The show is full of jokes, but I have to say, they're not funny anymore. They're not funny at all, they are lame and pathetic. I can't understand how a show like this could be nominated for "Best Comedy" If this show wasn't on, I would be happier. It's a waste of time, and I'm going to stop watching it. I'm sorry for this, but I don't see how a show like this can be nominated for "Best TV Show" It's not even good enough to be nominated as "worst show". I really can't understand how this show is on, what world is this? I guess the world is full of idiots, who likes this show. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one, who likes this show. I hope this show stays on, and I hope it gets cancelled. I'm only 18, and I don
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and that's saying something. I nearly fell asleep while watching this, which is saying a lot. I think the fact that it was made by the same people who wrote "Naked Gun" and "Naked Gun 2" might have something to do with it. They're that bad. I'm a big fan of "Naked Gun" and "Naked Gun 2", and I was excited to see how they would do a movie. <br /><br />I don't know what I expected, but this is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. Not only was it bad, it hurt my eyes to watch it.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie a 0.

I have to agree with the other reviewers who say that this is a very dark and very depressing movie. I'm not sure what the problem is with the actors but they were very wooden and they acted
 The movie just wasn't funny, with a few exceptions. It was a terrible movie. I was expecting a drama, but it turned out to be a comedy. There were a few funny moments, but this wasn't a comedy. I would have rather seen a comedy than a drama. The movie was just bad. I can't see what all the hype was about. I would rather a movie that was funny than a movie that was just boring. The few funny moments was just not enough to make up for the bad plot. I wouldn't watch it again, but I would watch it if it was on TV.

I give this movie a -4 out of 10

 I gleefully awaited the arrival of this film, as I had heard so much about it from the book, and I was excited to see it. I am still thrilled to have seen it, but I have to admit that I am not as enthralled by it as I was hoping to be. I felt that the best parts of the film were the ones that were in the book. I was expecting a big movie and it turned out to be a small movie, not a lot of movement, and a very predictable ending. I had hoped that the movie would be a lot different than the book, but I do not think that it was. The only thing that is different is that this is a "PG" movie, which I didn't mind, because I didn't want to be traumatized like I was with the book. I think that the movie could have been much better if it had been a lot longer, and had a lot more detail. I know that this is not the book, but I thought that the movie could have been better, and I was really upset that it wasn't. It was a very interesting movie, and I enjoyed it very much.

I would recommend this to anyone who has read the
 It is a very bad movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I was really looking forward to watching it, because I was expecting a lot. I have a hard time even watching bad TV shows, but this one was so bad I just couldn't stand it. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, mostly because I just can't stand being scared, but this one really creeped me out. The acting is awful, the characters are all one dimensional, the story is pointless, the sound is terrible, and it is all over too soon. I wish someone would have told me this was made in 1999 before I watched it, because I would have just overlooked it. Don't waste your time.

(Now that I've seen the whole thing, I give it a 2/10)

Well...this movie was awful. I can't believe that it was made in 1999. It was about a group of friends who go camping in a cabin in the woods, and end up being stalked by a group of people who escaped from a mental institution. The acting was so bad, it was just a horrible movie altogether. I had
 This movie is boring as hell. The plot is simple, the acting is terrible, and you don't care about the characters. The main character is a wimp and the main villian is a stupid moron. The only reason to see this movie is if you are a hardcore fan of the JET SKY series of movies or if you have recently watched and enjoyed "The Lost World" with Jeff Goldblum. If you have seen the first two movies, you can skip this one.<br /><br />If you are a hardcore fan of the JET SKY series of movies, you might like this one because it is very similar to those movies. The movie has a lot of action, but the action is very slow and boring. I can't tell you what happens in the movie, but there is a lot of fighting and a lot of people die. The main villain is a crappy villain and the main character is a wimp. The main villain is a guy who makes some people do things they don't want to do. He is a stupid moron, but the main character is even stupider. The main character is a wimp, which makes him look like a wimp. The movie is
 I had high hopes for this film. I love the original film, and I thought that this version would be closer to the original. I was wrong. The acting is horrible, and the plot is weak, and the only thing that saves it from being a total waste of time is the music.<br /><br />The plot is a mess. The videos at the beginning of the film are supposed to explain the plot, but they are so confusing, and so badly done, that I could not understand them. The story is weak, and far from the original. I know that the original is one of those films that has a weak plot, but this one is weak in almost every way. The acting is terrible. The only thing that saves the acting is the music.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with this film. I thought that it would be better, and I was sadly wrong. This film has nothing to do with the original. I am glad that I rented this film. I would not have wanted to spend 80 dollars on it. This film is not worth 80 dollars. This is not a movie. This is a waste of time. I would not recommend this film to anybody who doesn't like the original
 I saw this movie tonight. I loved it! It was one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a long time. I was laughing throughout the whole movie. If you like films like Army of Darkness, Don't Say a Word, and the Ring, you'll love this movie. I don't understand how it got so bad a rating. I liked the little girl, she looked a lot like a young Anna in the Ring. I was so happy when the little boy died too. I can't wait for the sequel.

 This is a unintentionally funny movie. It's a cross between some of the 70's "zombie" movies like "The Last Man on Earth", and the movie "Death Wish" (which was good, but this movie is not). In the beginning of the movie, we are told that the movie's title is "Zombie Island", and it's meant to be a parody of all of the "zombie" movies from the 70's. Later on in the movie, it's revealed that the movie's title is actually "Zombie Island". I felt that this was a good thing, because it's a pretty good movie. The acting is pretty good, and the special effects are okay. The movie has a pretty good comedic premise, and is pretty well written. I can't really recommend the movie, because it's pretty bad, but it is a good movie.

 Uninteresting plot, boring dialog, and horrible acting. The only redeeming quality is the actor's performance. While watching this movie, I immediately thought of the same comment made in the movie "...And Justice For All" when the character of Eddie Vedder (Quinn) was watching the movie "Conan the Barbarian". The comment was "...I have seen the light and I have seen the darkness, and it is the same..." The character in this movie has seen the light and has seen the darkness, and it is the same for the movie "Sleepless in Seattle". Yeah, that's right, it's the same movie. I had a hard time keeping focus on the plot. The plot is uninteresting and easily predictable. When the plot is predictable, the movie is dull. The movie is so predictable that the characters don't even act in a way that would be considered realistic. If a person acted the way they did in this movie in real life, they would be arrested for assault and battery, and there would be no question that their actions would be considered criminal. The movie is so predictable that the plot turns into a soap opera. The plot is so predictable that they could have had the two main characters in a room
 This film is so bad that it's almost laughable. The acting is atrocious, the writing is amateur, and the plot is just not good. The person who is raped by her father was sexy and hot! She didn't act like she was raped. She acted like she was "making it" with her father. She was not raped. The rape scene was just not good. I have seen better rape scenes in South Park. I think that this film is a punch line in the worst kind of way. Anyone who says that they like this film is just kidding themselves. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

 I watched this with my husband and we both had a similar reaction to the movie... We thought it was good, but hadn't the best timing and pacing. We felt it was a little too long and some of the scenes dragged on and on... I'm also not sure if that was because the movie was trying to "shock" us, but it didn't really feel like it made much of a lasting impact. My husband thought the ending was pretty bad, and I agree, it just kind of ended with a whimper. The movie was OK, but nothing great... I enjoyed the acting and thought the movie was fairly well acted, but I think the movie could have used a little more polish. I think it just needed a little more work overall, and I don't think it was a "horror" movie. I was hoping it was and felt like it tried to be, but it just wasn't. I actually think the movie could have been a little better than it was, but I don't think it was a bad movie. I think it had some good ideas, but just wasn't executed well. I'm still not sure if I would recommend it... If you really want to see it, I say go for
 I was bored, so I watched this movie. I'm here to tell you, this movie is a piece of crap. The acting is atrocious. The writing is awful. The plot is stupid. The characters are stupid. The effects are bad. The plot is so stupid it made me want to puke. I don't understand why anyone would want to make this movie.

I think this film is as bad as Deep Blue Sea. The only thing that is good in Deep Blue Sea is the effects. Everything else is bad. This is the same way with this movie. The only thing that is good in this movie is the effects. Everything else is bad. This film is worse than Deep Blue Sea. It has less action and plot.

If you have seen Deep Blue Sea, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't seen Deep Blue Sea, I highly suggest you watch Deep Blue Sea. It's an amazing movie.

The plot is so stupid that it's beyond boring. The writing is so bad that it's beyond annoying. The acting is so bad that I want to slap the characters silly. The effects are so bad that I want to slap the director silly. The characters are
 I must admit, I am a huge fan of the first two "Godzilla" movies. The first one was actually the first Godzilla movie I ever saw and it was awesome. The second one had some cool effects, but I felt like it was more of a monster movie then an action/adventure. I was surprised to see that Toho had decided to make a third Godzilla film. I wasn't expecting it to be so bad. It was a bit like watching a kiddie show. It was just boring, and from what I can remember the special effects were horrible. The story was just as bad. I think it was supposed to be a sequel, but it really wasn't. It was really just a lousy excuse to make another Godzilla movie. I really don't know how Toho could've lost money on this movie. It wasn't even worth watching. The only good thing I can say is that it was good to see Godzilla in the U.S. I thought it was very cool that they were able to get the rights to use Godzilla in this movie. I guess they didn't want to pay too much money to put Godzilla in the film. I don't think I will ever watch this movie again.

 As bad as this movie is, it is entertaining. We can easily see the different writers and directors that were involved. But it is obvious that the budget was tight. We do see different costume styles from the other movies and we do see some of the cars from later movies. The actors are actually fairly good, especially the young boy and the older actor who is dressed like Rambo. They are believable in their roles. The only problem is that the plot is all over the place and the movie is very incoherent. Some of the scenes are so bad that they will make you laugh or even cringe! <br /><br />Take this movie as a guilty pleasure. But don't expect much.

7/10

<br /><br />Watch it if you are a fan of the Rambo movies. I don't mean to be mean but this movie is awful. I have never seen a movie with so many lines that I wanted to cringe so badly at and so many scenes that I wanted to laugh at. I generally won't watch a movie that has a rating over a 4.0 and this one is definitely that bad. I am surprised that this movie even got released. But if you
 This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, it's not even humorous. It's just... blah.<br /><br />Forget about it, and I hope you live a long life and never see this film.

I came to the conclusion that this movie was made for a contest, because it was so poor. I decided to watch it anyway just because it was free. I thought it would be interesting to watch the actors in their first film. I watched it and became very disappointed.<br /><br />The acting was awful, the dialogue was as bad as the acting. There was not one thing I liked about the movie. I could have made this review shorter and just said that the movie sucked. I feel sorry for the actors who have to go out and work on this piece of garbage. I would recommend this movie to any one who has nothing else to watch.

 I don't know why I even watched this movie. I saw the "B" rating and thought, "Oh boy, this is gonna be some kind of campy horror/comedy." But it was just so bad! I was sitting there thinking, "Why? Why did I waste my time on this?" The characters were so obnoxious and annoying that I wanted to scream! I mean, their dialogue was so bad! I've seen some bad dialogue, but this was so bad that I didn't even care if they were killed off in the end.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie, in my opinion, was the music. The music gave the movie a sort of "redneck" feel which I thought was cool.<br /><br />I really don't have anything to say about this movie, except that I'm glad I wasted my time watching it and I hope it stays in the bargain bins forever.

 I don't know what the hell this movie is about, but I do know that it is boring, slow, and pretentious. If you want to see a movie that makes you want to fall asleep, this ain't it. If you want to see a movie that makes you want to skip to the next scene, this ain't it. If you want to see a movie in which the main character is an evil jerk that does evil things, this ain't it. If you're a fan of the book, you'd be disappointed. If you're a fan of the movie, you'd be disappointed. If you're a fan of movies in general, you'd be disappointed. I'm giving it a three because I think it's the only way to get the point across. First of all, it's not a horror movie. It's not scary. It's not suspenseful. It's not funny. It's not even exciting. It's just plain bad.

<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not sure why anybody would like this movie. It's not funny. It's not scary. It's not suspenseful. It's not funny. It's not suspenseful. It's not exciting
 Actually, to be fair, it's not as bad as I remember it. But it is not a good movie at all. It's just a little bit offensive. I can understand the point of view of those who see it as a "social" movie, but then again, the whole idea of the movie is that it's absurd and absurdist and no one should take it seriously. The way it's shot, the way it's edited, the way it's acted, it's supposed to be funny because it is absurd. And it is. But then again, it's not a good movie. The characters are merely caricatures. The director seems to be making a point that being gay should be funny, but I don't get the joke. Maybe I'm too straight. But if you're going to make a movie about gay characters, you have to make them interesting. You can't just have them as a stereotype, as someone's joke.

I have to say that I found it disappointing. I'm not saying that I didn't find it funny, in fact I did, but I can't say that it was funny for the right reasons. Maybe I'm just too straight. Maybe I'm too picky
 This is a film that should have been an instant classic. It has the perfect premise. It has the perfect cast. And it has the perfect premise. A group of friends decide to visit the Grand Canyon, but soon find they may not be prepared for what they find. They all soon find themselves haunted by the ghosts of the past. But it isn't long before they realize that they are now the ghosts. This film should have been a big hit. But it seemed to be completely overlooked. This is a film that you should see at least once. It is a shame that it didn't take off.

If you are a horror fan, and have never seen a slasher film, this is a film that you should see. It has been a long time coming, but it is finally here. It is a story that has been told at many times and in many ways, but this is the one that I really like. It is a good story, and a good movie. It is a film that has all the elements of a good film. It is a good cast, with a good cast. It is a good story,
 I really couldn't have cared less about the story, about the characters, about the whole movie. I'm a huge fan of the original, and I'm not a fan of the first. I think it was a great idea to do a remake, but it wasn't done very well at all. I also feel that the movie was too long. I think the first one was about 40 minutes longer than the remake. I would've liked to have seen more of the movie, and less of the previews of the upcoming movies. I think the character names should've been changed too. It was very hard to keep track of who the characters were. The actors were the same, but the names were different. I think the actors in the movie did an ok job, but they could've done a better job. The story could've been better too. I feel like they wasted a lot of time on the original story. I also think that the movie should've had more suspense, like the original.

I also feel that the movie had some very questionable issues. Like, why would a person do that? I felt like it was very weird. I also feel that the movie was a little bit too scary for younger kids. I
 I expected a lot of great things from this movie but it was terrible. The acting was awful, the story was boring and the directing was poor. It was so bad I had to turn it off halfway through and go back to the movie I was watching before. I don't know what it is about but I have never ever been so bored watching a movie in my entire life. That's saying a lot because I have seen a lot of bad movies.

<br /><br />But I guess I can't blame the movie for being bad, the director and the writers should have known better.

<br /><br />I only watched it through because I didn't want to miss anything and it was only one hour and forty minutes long. But even that was too much. There was very little to the story and most of the time I was watching the same scene over and over.

<br /><br />It would be great if I could say that the acting was good but that wasn't the case. The actors were the worst I have ever seen. The actors were so bad that it made the whole thing even worse.

<br /><br />I don't know what it
 After watching this movie, I felt a bit cheated. The acting is mediocre at best, and the story is just not very good. The plot is very predictable, and the characterizations of the various characters are not very good. I think the main characters, Mike and Julia, are just downright annoying. The characters of the other two couples are okay, but are not well developed. The ending is very disappointing, as it is almost exactly like the ending of The Graduate. Overall, I found this movie to be pretty boring and unsatisfying.

*** I feel compelled to add, in the "see it to believe it" department, that the characters in this movie are portrayed to be very wealthy and successful, yet they have a very small town home, and still drive a very small car. It's almost like they don't make enough money to live in the kind of house that they have.

*** I guess what I'm trying to say is that I was left with the feeling that this movie was just kind of a "flash in the pan" for writer/director, David Swinson. Watch it and see for yourself.

*** This is definitely a rental.

*** P.S. - I found
 This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the script is unbelievable, and the story is just terrible. The only good thing about this movie is that it is only 90 minutes long. I hope that nobody buys this movie. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.

 I have seen many, many, many movies in my life, but this is the first time I have seen one so bad, that I can't even finish it. The film was so bad that I just gave up and walked out, even though I had paid for it. The only thing I can think of to compare it with is the movie "The Blair witch project", which was actually a good movie. I am not really a fan of the horror genre, but this one is just flat out bad. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the other reviewers had actually seen the movie and were just being sarcastic. I highly recommend you stay away from this one, unless you just want to see some one make a fool out of themselves and their audience like I did.

 I was so excited when I saw this on DVD because I love films that are so bad they're good. I wanted to see this to laugh at it because it is so bad, and it is so bad. It is so bad that it is good in a way. There are some good scenes in this film, one of which is when the couple is eating at the restaurant and the waiter is making the appetizer and looking at the couple and then goes out and gets the food for them. That is a very nice scene. But other than that, the acting is bad and the script is terrible.<br /><br />The film is about a couple of models who are having a dinner party and they think that they can handle the booze pretty well. Well, they are extremely intoxicated and they are being loud and annoying. Then they see a man who is also obnoxious and obnoxious, and they are all obnoxious. Then we see a couple of scenes of the guys and the girls going at it and everyone is making out and having sex. Then there is an accident and the couple drowns in their own vomit. Then the woman says that she feels like she is going to have an orgasm and she does. Then we see the next day
 The first movie I've seen in the new millennium. I was so bored I actually fell asleep (snooze button on the remote). There was no plot or character development. The whole movie was just a poorly constructed, poorly acted scene with a few random chase scenes thrown in to fill a 90 minute film. I could tell it was a low budget film and wondered why all the actors were unknowns. I couldn't even figure out who the villain was until the end. The movie was like a cheap made for TV movie. I can't believe this is the number one most rented and highest grossing movie. It's embarrassing to see the Razzie name attached to such a cheap and sloppy movie.

 A decent enough B-movie from the first 5 minutes or so, but it quickly goes downhill. The action is laughable and the acting is atrocious. The film's main problem, though, is that it's made by these guys who don't even have the decency to include a title card when showing the names of the characters, which makes it difficult to keep track of them later on. Although the idea is not too bad, the film is way too slow, and the characters' motivation is not clear.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading James M. Ward's review on IMDb. While he failed to discover why the movie was so bad, he did a much better job at explaining why it was so slow. I personally think that the director was trying to create a very slow-paced film, but his poor writing skills prevent him from achieving his goal.

 I went in with very low expectations and a vague memory of loving the first movie. I was completely let down by this film. I have never seen such a terrible movie. The acting was awful. The characters were unlikable. The story was predictable. The dialog was god-awful. This movie was just horrible. I hope they never make another movie like this.

In the end, I didn't really enjoy it, but I wasn't as depressed as I thought I would be. I just felt very let down. I don't consider myself a bad movie fan. I have a fairly high tolerance for bad movies. This movie just went way beyond. I don't recommend it.

 This is a very disappointing film. It appears that the director's main interest in his work is the camera. He seems to think that the camera is an instrument, like the violin, that can be manipulated to produce great beauty. Unfortunately, the camera can only be as beautiful as the person behind it. And, in this case, that person is a dolt. The plot is endlessly confusing and involves a lot of walking around, which is a good thing, because the action scenes are poorly shot and the dialogue is worse.<br /><br />The director should be embarrassed by this film. It is poorly done, the plot is uninteresting, the actors are not believable, the music is annoying and the camera work is horrendous. I give it a D.

 This movie is supposed to be a satire of the film industry, however it is not a satire, it is an insult. This movie has so many problems with it, it is impossible to even count them all. The characters are one dimensional, the dialogue is a mess and the story is just plain bad. The only good thing about this movie is that it is over quickly. If you have ever seen a movie that has been put together by someone who clearly knows nothing about the film industry, you will know what I am talking about. I have seen a lot of bad movies, however I have never seen a movie as badly made as this one. There is nothing funny to say about this movie, the jokes don't even make any sense. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, it is not just bad, it is bad to the point of being offensive. If you want to see a movie that is funny, watch the Marx brothers, or Monty Python. I could go on for hours about how bad this movie is, I just don't want to bore you. If you have seen every movie in the world and have a good sense of humor, this movie might just be for you, but I highly recommend that you skip it
 This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The plot was so incredibly bad that it is almost impossible to watch it without laughing. It's like watching a train wreck, you are helpless to stop watching. The plot was threadbare and the characters were so flat that you can't wait to see them die. The main character is so completely out of touch with reality that you know that she must be the one to make all the decisions. The plot is so ridiculous that the only way to continue watching is to laugh at it. I'm sure that the people who made this movie would like to think of it as a comedy. But I don't think that is the case. I think it's a pathetic attempt at a comedy. Watching this movie is like watching a person who is so out of touch with reality that you can't help but feel sorry for them. I have no idea how this movie could have been made. It is just an insult to the intelligence of anyone who would watch it.

 'Chunky' was made in 1967 and is the only film made by Francis Thompson, a prolific British filmmaker of the 1950's and 60's. Written by Muriel St Clare Byrne, one of the UK's leading screenwriters of the time, the film tells the story of a chunky girl who takes her boyfriend to see a comedy film which is being shown in a village cinema. She is shocked to find that the film is in fact a hardcore pornographic film and subsequently realises that she has been deceived by the film. The film is built around the story of a man having sex with a horse, so the whole film is about deception. Throughout the film the audience are informed that Chunky has been taken in by the film, but she never realises that this is in fact the case. The film is well shot, the acting is not particularly good and the script is a bit silly, but despite all that this is a pretty decent film.

Chunky is a silly and camp film which sees a girl being duped by a sex film. Although the film is quite boring, it is still quite watchable. The film is quite silly, but it's also quite good
 I am so glad I had some friends with me when I viewed this film. I was so angry at the things that went on and I was also very disappointed that it was a Canadian-made film. I have been watching too much of Canadian films recently. What is wrong with Canadian films? They are always horrible and unwatchable. I just did not understand the point of this film. It was boring and I did not find the characters very sympathetic. I felt sorry for them but I wanted to hit the screen. I think that this film would be much better if the characters were not so stupid and naive. I think that this film could have been much better if the direction was not so shaky. I think that the acting was not very good. I did not think that the characters were very believable. I was very much disappointed in this film and I think that I will never watch it again. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

I had a great time watching this film. I have to say that it was very entertaining. I have watched some horror films before and I have to say that I did not like the horror films
 The producers of this movie have tried to make this film as realistic as possible. But, they made a fatal mistake by casting actors who don't even know how to act. I think they were trying to make this movie as realistic as possible, but they ended up making a terrible movie with one of the worst lead actors. I can only imagine what the producers of the film are thinking right now. This movie is so bad that it makes you turn your head and say "WTF?"<br /><br />I love this movie for the special effects and the acting. The special effects of this movie are amazing and it is a real treat to watch. Unfortunately, the acting is terrible. The actors are not consistent and it is hard to understand what they are saying most of the time. The storyline is also horrible due to the fact that this movie is basically a mystery movie. If you have any interest in seeing this movie, then I am sorry to say that it will be hard for you to enjoy this movie to the fullest. Please make sure that you don't listen to the critics of this movie and watch the movie for yourself. Take the chance and see this movie. The movie is not that bad.<br /><br />
 I am a fan of the original "Alien" and "Aliens". I was very excited when I heard that this sequel was coming out and then when I saw the trailer, I was even more excited! Then I saw the movie and I was disappointed. The movie was very boring and I could not understand the "twists" that were happening. The film was very slow moving and nothing really happened. It seemed as if they just threw in random scenes in the movie. The ending was very weak and I do not understand how they could do such a thing. I definitely do not recommend this movie, unless you are a die hard fan of the first two films and you want to see them again. I would give this movie a 1/10.

 I have to agree that this movie is not very good. It made me think of a Steven Segal movie where the bad guy is doing something so horrible that the hero(s) have to come rescue the helpless(s). In this case, there is no helpless. There is a woman who has been abused by her boyfriend, a girl who has been abused by her friend, a girl who has been abused by her brother, and a girl who has been abused by her father. So what is the hero(s) to do? Okay, if you want to do something about the crimes against women, you should make a movie about it. The movie is not very good for that reason. On the other hand, I found the storyline to be interesting. I saw the movie because it was nominated for an Academy Award, and it was the only one I saw that was nominated. I'm glad I saw it. It was good for what it was.

 I am giving this film a 2 because I felt bad for the kid and thought he did a good job. I guessed the ending about 3/4 of the way through. Don't take my word for it, go see it yourself and see if you can guess the ending. I thought the film was very confined in it's setting and I was constantly reminded of "The Sixth Sense". I also thought that the ending was very weak, and that it was too easy to figure out the ending. That is not to say that the ending was bad, just that it was not very creative and I felt like the film could have been much better. I would recommend renting this film, and if you are a fan of horror films, you will like the film. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see the film, but if you do you won't be disappointed. I give it a 2.

Saw this movie at the theater--wow! The acting was excellent, the directing was the best I've seen in a long time, and the story is creepy and very well-crafted. It's the first movie I've seen in
 I had to read this in a short time and it was a crummy experience. This movie is a rip-off of the movie THE WEDDING PLANNER. I was surprised how bad it was. I should have known when I saw the trailer that it was not worth watching. I thought it was going to be a good movie, but it was just boring, and the acting was horrible. I give it a D+. It's no Wedding Planner, that's for sure.

This movie is about a young woman, who is a wedding planner, and she helps her best friend, who is getting married.

 I had such high expectations for this film. I thought it would be a great way to see Jennifer Garner. Unfortunately the movie just did not live up to my anticipations. Perhaps I had my hopes set too high, but I was not happy with the movie at all. The movie was very slow and I found it predictable. The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending. I was very disappointed in this film. I would watch it again only if I was on a plane and had nothing better to do. It did have a few laughs, but it was not enough for me.

 I was a huge fan of the original 'The Beach' and was excited to see how the second in the series would be coming along. Unfortunately, this is not the sequel I was hoping for.<br /><br />For starters, the entire cast of the original film is absent and the new characters, although well-written, aren't as memorable. Secondly, the film is way too long and although it is well-written, it is too slow and boring at times. Thirdly, while the original film was such a unique film, I found the new film to be extremely generic and predictable. Finally, although the acting is solid, the dialogue seemed very forced and the plot doesn't seem to go anywhere. 'The Beach' was so original and had such a unique atmosphere that it was hard to compare the two films. I highly recommend you rent the original film before you see this one.

 It looks like I missed a good one here. I know this was a low budget film, but even by low budget horror movie standards I found it to be lackluster. I saw it at a friends house and he had told me that it was a good one and I should watch it, and it was ok, but nothing special. I would rather wait for the dvd. I am not sure if the guy in the movie is supposed to be a cop or some sort of security guard but he was just plain annoying. I really hate these characters in movies who are supposedly supposed to be cops, but are really just plain stupid and bumbling. I do not like movies where the characters are portrayed as being so stupid that they should be fired from their jobs. It is one thing to have a bad cop, but it is quite another to have characters portrayed as being so stupid that they are unable to work in their jobs. Even though it was low budget, I found it to be pretty low rent. I found the storyline to be pretty lame, just like the acting. I think the only reason I did not give it a 1 is because it is a horror movie and there is nothing much to start with. I think if you are a
 After seeing this 'Citizen Kane' for the first time at a college, I immediately needed to see it again. This is a very entertaining film, with a wonderful cast, great dialogue and a story that will keep you interested. The problem is, the film is extremely dated, and the way the film is made, it will not be appreciated by those who are not in their teens or early twenties.<br /><br />The film is basically one character in which the story is told. The story revolves around a mystery. A mystery that has been going on for years, but no one knows the true story.<br /><br />The film is set in the future, and is a very visual film. This is the first time I have seen a film that uses color and special effects in such a way. The story centers around a young man named Dirk who is involved in a very strange and mysterious situation, and is determined to solve the mystery. There is the love interest, a young woman named Nicole, who is one of the top models in the world. The pace of the story is very slow, and the character development is very good. This is a very dark film, and it's not just because of the subject
 The most common explanation I hear for this movie's failure is that the director and the writer have terrible scripts. But this is nonsense. This is a very well-made, well-acted movie. But the plot is so absurd, so uncontrolled, so unbelievable, that this movie is hard to watch. The plot is a mix of a bad romance novel and a bad spy movie. It is a very bad spy movie, for that matter. I can't believe that it is possible for a movie to be so bad. I just can't believe it. The acting is so bad, that it doesn't even matter. The plot is so bad, that it is hard to watch. The script is so bad, that it is hard to watch. This movie is just bad.

The plot is just so stupid. It makes no sense. And the acting is just so bad. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such horrible acting. It is so bad that it is hard to believe it is a movie. This is a very bad movie.

The plot is a mix of a romance novel and a bad spy movie. The first half of the movie has action scenes. But the action scenes are underdeveloped

I had no idea what this movie was about, but I was sure it was going to be bad. I was right. This movie completely sucked. It had one of the worst plots I've ever heard. There were some pretty good special effects, but they didn't add up to a good movie. The acting was good. Don't get me wrong, I still don't know what exactly this movie was about, but I think it was supposed to be a comedy. I don't think it was. This movie was also predictable. There was one scene where I was almost sure it was going to happen, but it didn't. Another scene was just weird. I don't know if it was worth watching or not. I mean, I got my money's worth, but it wasn't worth the time.

 I really felt like I was watching 'The Return' again. I don't know why, but it just reminded me of it. I feel like this movie was made by the same people who made 'The Return.'<br /><br />So, I was really disappointed with the movie. It's a typical horror movie about a woman who is possessed by a demon and she must try to kill everyone that is trying to hurt her. I don't even remember what happens in this movie, but it didn't surprise me. As soon as I walked into the movie theater, I just knew that I wasn't going to like this film. I had watched 'The Return' and I was expecting this movie to be just as bad.<br /><br />I really don't know what the point of this movie was. I mean, it's the same exact thing, but they tried to make it a little bit more psychological. I don't know what the point of that was either. I just didn't like it. The only thing it's good for is watching the actors run around in their underwear.

 I got the DVD after seeing the huge number of five star reviews on IMDb.<br /><br />I have to say I was both shocked and dismayed. I have seen far better films than this. <br /><br />It is a very pale imitation of a Hammer production. The acting is wooden and the plot is so thin that it could be used as a door mat. The special effects are poor, the sets poor and the photography poor.<br /><br />I was expecting a good old fashioned Hammer style film and was left disappointed.

1.0 out of 5 stars A very poor remake. Format: DVD I read the criticisms of this movie and was prepared to give the film a chance. The story line was rubbish but I thought the acting might be good. I was wrong. The acting was terrible and the story was even worse. I watched the film on DVD and was left with a headache. I would recommend that you look elsewhere and buy the original Hammer film.

 I had high hopes for this movie, given the pedigree of the director, Tom McCarthy, who wrote/directed the Oscar-winning "The Station Agent", and the cast, which includes Ethan Hawke, who is himself a fine actor. Unfortunately, this movie falls flat by using what I can only describe as a "SOD" approach to filmmaking. The script is a boring, predictable mess, and the actors seem to be phoning in their performances. If you can look past this, and instead consider it a testament to the director, who was clearly trying to do something interesting, then you'll find this movie mildly entertaining. Of course, it could have been a lot more entertaining, but the movie just doesn't rise above the level of being mildly entertaining. As an example of the SOD, I can think of only one scene that was memorable, when the old man (Hawke) gets a girlfriend, and the rest of the movie is the "going out on a date" scenes and the lack of them, with the exception of an embarrassing and awkward attempt at a sex scene. This movie could have used a lot more sex scenes. I have to say that I'm surprised that McCarthy has apparently directed more than one movie.
 This film is a genuine disaster. The first time I saw it, I thought it was a spoof, and I have seen it so many times in the theater I have lost count. But this is NOT a spoof. The film is totally insane. It's about a man who decides to take his family to a new planet, but has to go through all kinds of trials and tribulations to survive. This is a very, very bad movie. The acting is really bad, the plot is confusing and the special effects are laughable. It's all over the place and very, very dumb. But I keep going back to it because it's so bad that it's funny. If you want to see a bad movie, you could do a lot worse. But that doesn't mean it's worth wasting your time watching.

 I have never seen a film so poorly written. The plot was flimsy, the characters were undeveloped, and the ending was stretched beyond belief. I am a huge fan of the Dragnet series and this movie will not bring me back to watching it.

Guide yourself through this film by using your own imagination and you'll find it to be a huge mistake!

 This is clearly a movie made by someone who has no idea what horror movies are supposed to be like. I have seen many movies which are not scary and this movie is not scary. The film jumps around from death scene to death scene with no meaningful connection between them. This is not how a horror movie is supposed to be! The biggest crime I see here is the lack of violence. I expected a lot more killing. This movie is about a ghost, yes? And there was only one ghost in the whole movie. And it was only really killed by the police. The only thing that I liked about this movie was the opening credits. The title of the movie is not scary. It does not make any sense. The title of the movie should be "The Evil that Men do". They killed the ghost and they made it so that no one else could find out about it. This is not a good movie. It is not scary. It is not even scary in the way a ghost movie should be. The movie is not scary.

 I have to say this movie was really a disappointment. It could have been a great film but it fell far short. The acting was awful, the plot was contrived, the dialogue was ridiculous and the ending was totally unexpected. I was really hoping for a great dark comedy but was totally disappointed.

I understand the movie was trying for a dark comedy but it was a bit too far into the comedy for my liking. I would have preferred more comedy, less drama and less serious.

The movie was really not good enough to make me want to bother going out of my way to see it again.

I would have liked to have seen the movie done with a more serious tone and a happier ending. I would have preferred the movie to be more of a dark comedy with a tragic ending.

I found the acting to be very poor and the script very badly written. The storyline was very weak, the characters were not developed very well and the plot was too contrived.

I found the movie to be very long, boring and very slow.

It was very long, boring and very slow. I was expecting something very much darker and more serious. This movie didn't have any of the qualities
 Not the best of the "Big Band" genre.<br /><br />The film is a bit long and drawn out. The songs are not the best, and the acting is in general a bit too obvious. Some of the acting is very good, while some of it is poor. There are some interesting moments, but overall this is not a great film.<br /><br />It is a good film for the novelty factor, but overall it is not the best.<br /><br />3/10

 This is a terrible movie. It's cheesy, it's boring, and it's just stupid. The character development is horrible, the acting is horrible, and the dialog is horrible. The plot is so ridiculous that it's laughable. It's the most ridiculous, idiotic plot I've ever seen in a movie. The only thing that saves the movie from being a complete waste of time is the music. The music is pretty good and did give me a bit of a smile. The fact that the acting is so bad and the dialog is so terrible is sad, especially since the music is pretty good. I'm usually a big fan of movies that are bad, but in this case, I wish I had never seen this movie.

 I'm in two minds about writing this review....First, I think the film is an excellent idea, and I'm glad that the filmmakers tried to do something different. Second, I believe the film is a bit of a mess. We follow a woman who is trying to make a living as a professional photographer, and who falls in love with a man who works in IT. I think the idea is a good one, and the script was certainly written with a lot of integrity, but I think the film is too long, and too slow. The film focuses on the woman's life, and the man's work, and although we learn a lot about what it takes to be a photographer, and what it takes to be a web designer, the film could have been shorter, and could have focused more on the love story. In short, I think the film is an excellent idea, and I believe it could have been better.

 I thought I was in for the best of the worst of the worst when I saw this movie. I am a big fan of those "bad" 80's movies and so I was expecting something that would be so bad that it would be good, but this movie was so bad that it was not even worth watching. The story line is extremely weak with all the clichés that you could possibly think of. The acting is just bad. The only good thing about this movie is the ending which is better than the rest of the movie. I can't really say anything good about it, but it's a good way to waste a couple of hours.

The first thing that strikes me about this movie is that the setting is identical to the movie "Cannibal Holocaust", which is a good thing because that's the only good movie that came from the same director. I was expecting it to be even worse, but I was surprised when I watched it. It's not that good, but it's not as bad as I was afraid it would be. There is one scene in which the cannibal eats his own mother, but the cannibal is not
 I have to admit that I was quite disappointed by this film. I had heard that the director was a genius and that the film was going to be "magnificent" (whatever that means), but I must say that the result did not live up to the hype. Unfortunately the film was only shown in one cinema in the UK, so I didn't get the chance to see it on the big screen. I just wish I had. The film is very slow and not very entertaining. The acting is not very good, and I was left thinking that the film was a waste of time. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that I was hoping that it would get better. It did not.

I hope that the director will make a better film in the future.

The film is about two young adults who are living together in the house of a rich lady. The lady dies, and they decide to sell the house and go to a new town. In their new town they meet a young lady who has a car, and they decide to go on a road trip with her. The problem is that they don't know how to drive. They try to teach the young lady, but the results are not
 I had watched the final episode of the series, and was contemplating on whether or not to watch the sequel. I decided to watch it, and I have to say, I'm glad I didn't. Although, I'm not sure if it's the same people that made the show, I felt the overall plot was very weak and the writing was terrible. I could tell what the plot was going to be because there were a lot of pointless tangents that tried to make the show more interesting, but failed to do so. I can't see why this show had such a large following. I've seen a few episodes of "Titus", and I thought it was good. I guess it's just the "Judge Dredd" fan in me that likes the way the original comic is written. I would much rather watch that than watch this show.

I hope the creators of this show do not try to make another one, because they will fail.

 This made-for-TV movie is such a shame. I had read a lot of reviews that said the movie was good and I was excited. I guess the main problem was that I went into the movie without knowing what it was about. I had heard that it was about a family that kidnaps someone's son, but I had no clue if it was a comedy or a drama. I am glad I didn't go in expecting it to be a comedy because I probably would have walked out in boredom. The acting was terrible; the characters were not believable, and the plot was not very interesting or believable. If anything there was a little suspense, but that was because of the actors, not because of the plot. I would give this movie 1/10.

 In the movie, the building is called "The Hiding Place", but the real name is "The Sanctuary". The movie is good but the story is confusing. In the book, there is no such confusion. The whole story is about a girl, named "Sarah", and a boy, named "Ethan". Sarah's father was killed by a man named "Balthazar". Then, the girl was sent to "The Sanctuary", a home for girls who have been raped or abused. The Sanctuary is a place where girls are believed to be in danger. <br /><br />The movie is confusing because the director decided to tell a story that has no relation to the book.

 I've seen this movie & read the book it's based on, and I'm still not quite sure which one is worse. Either way it's a bad movie, but it's a movie with a really bad pedigree. The 80s were in a slump when this film was made, and I think the movie had a lot to do with that. The 80s were the decade of the slasher film, and this movie came out at the worst time possible.<br /><br />This movie is basically a complete rip-off of Halloween, except that this movie is filled with psychotic teenagers and not a whole bunch of psychotic adults. I would say that the only thing that's even slightly original about this movie is the setting of the whole thing, but that's not saying much. The 80s had the whole "haunted house" thing down to a science, and this movie looks like it was made in the 90s & then released the same year that Halloween II was released. The acting is pretty bad & the special effects are cheap looking. But this movie is still pretty scary when you think about it. Most horror movies nowadays are pretty tame, so you can't really go too hard on this film. However, the acting
 From the first moment, I knew that I was going to hate this movie and couldn't wait for it to end. I really wanted to like it more, but it was just too slow and drawn out for my taste. I can't believe that a director would think it's a good idea to have a lengthy scene of a young girl, who is supposedly going to die, talking about her life. Yes, she's young, but there's no need to make it appear that she's going to live her entire life all over again. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so boring, but on the other hand, this movie did provide me with a lot of fodder for a lot of laughs. For example, if you watch closely, you can see that the people in the background are so bored that they're actually still sitting at the dinner table. If the death scene was in a different house, the people in the background would have gotten up and left a long time ago. The movie was also so slow that it was painful to watch. I wanted to see lots of people die, but instead I was forced to sit through this scene over and over again. The only good thing about this movie was that it
 I watched this movie and was shocked to see the high rating it has here. "I'm bored" is a title that would be appropriate for this movie. I'd say the story of this movie is "I'm bored". It is rated "R" for "Risk" too! What a joke!<br /><br />There are several horrible storylines in this movie. First off, the most annoying storyline is when the President of the United States (can't remember his name) is busy having sex with a woman. The President is supposed to be a married man. But, the President is having sex with a woman. I guess he was having sex with his wife too, and he has to have sex with a woman. It's not even a secret that the President is having sex with a woman. But, the President is a married man, so he must have sex with a woman. The President is a married man. He has to have sex with a woman. If a man is a married man, he has to have sex with a woman. What a stupid storyline.<br /><br />The other storyline is when the President has sex with another woman. He is married, and he is having sex with
 I've watched the first episode of "1st class" and the second one. They're both pretty bad and don't know what to do with their time. I have never seen a movie or a series that has similarities to them. The humor is so bad that it's funny. The acting is horrible. They don't even try to act. The only thing that makes this show worth watching is the fact that it's so bad. If you want to waste your time on a bad show, go ahead and watch this. I'll let you know what to expect.<br /><br />I would give this show a 0 out of 10 if I could.

If you want to see a show that is poorly acted, poorly written, and poorly put together, watch "1st Class".

1st Class is a rip-off of "The Class" and "The Class is On Fire".

 This movie is an absolute piece of trash. I am a huge fan of the original "Basket Case" and was really looking forward to the remake. I was very disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, the acting is terrible. The acting is not convincing and the dialogue is unrealistic. This film is a depressing watch and I don't recommend it at all. The only thing that kept me watching was the thought that there might be one or two good scenes. I know this is a remake and you can't expect that the movie will be like the original, but it is just not a good film. The script is awful and the movie is not scary at all. The original "Basket Case" was very scary, but this is not. It is just a very depressing and depressing movie. I am sorry to say that I won't be watching the sequel.

Watch the original instead.

 I'm not sure what exactly I expected when I walked into this movie theatre. I just knew I was going to watch something which was not supposed to be good, and I was going to have to sit through it.<br /><br />The acting was bad, the script was bad, the cinematography was bad, the editing was bad, the storyline was bad....yup, bad in all the right ways.<br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have seen some crappy movies, but this is in a whole different league. I was so bored by the acting and the storyline that I was actually distracted by how bad it was. It's actually really sad because it really is that bad.<br /><br />I can't say I'll never watch it again, but I can't say I'd recommend it to anybody.

 Don't be fooled by the title of this movie. The title is "Little Shop of Horrors" and the movie is about a little shop that sells plants and flowers. The only thing that's little is the size of the shop. The shop is huge. It's like a normal store. There's nothing in the shop that would have you think it's a shop devoted to plants and flowers. The movie is about Seymour Krelborn, who is a florist and the only employee of the flower shop. Seymour is about to get married to Audrey II. When he sees Audrey II, he instantly falls in love with her. He wants to propose to her, but Audrey II is cold to him. Seymour becomes determined to win her over by getting her to fall in love with him. He even goes to the extent of killing Audrey II's pet. He succeeds in getting her to fall in love with him, but only so that he can break up with her. This movie is stupid. I was really bored through the whole thing. The characters were weak, the script was weak and the acting was weak. I can't believe that this movie is considered a comedy. You either have to be a very diehard fan of the

 It is hard to understand why this movie is rated so high. It has all the ingredients of a bad TV movie, with a thin plot, the dialogue not even good enough to be transcribed, and about half a dozen people in the cast that are too old for their parts. The visual effects are bad, and the script is even worse. There are plenty of examples of a director who is trying but doesn't succeed. It is a good example of why some people are told to not direct, because they can't write a script. This movie is being promoted as being a great horror film, but when I watched it I saw nothing that suggested that.

Perhaps the most egregious thing is that the only people in the movie who seem to be in almost constant pain are the characters who are supposed to be in pain. This makes it hard for the viewer to sympathize with their plight.

This movie is a total mess, and it doesn't even have a good ending.

I would avoid this movie. There are plenty of better horror films out there.

 I personally loved the first half of the film. It was very engaging and had some very good scenes, but the second half of the film was just so bad that it spoiled the whole movie for me.<br /><br />I have to say that I've seen some films that are much worse, though. I can't say that this is one that I would recommend to anyone. It's not just that it was bad, but it was just, well, boring and I didn't find it interesting at all.

<br /><br />I got the feeling that this film was made as a money-making scheme. It just seemed to me that it was made to cash in on the success of the first film and the fact that it was based on the book "A Prayer for Owen Meany" by John Irving. I don't know whether that is the case, but that's how it came across to me.<br /><br />I would watch the first half of the film again, but I would never watch the second half again.

<br /><br />I give the film two stars.

 I've never seen a movie as bad as this. It's not funny and not scary. If it were supposed to be a horror movie, I would think it would be more scary, but it isn't. It's just terrible. I HATED the acting, the script, the acting, the script, the acting, the script, the acting, the script, the acting, the script, ... you get the idea. I mean, everyone in the movie is just plain bad. The only good thing about the movie is the vampire. I mean, she's so good looking that I almost wanted to believe she was a real vampire. But I know that's impossible. It's just funny how she's so hot, but yet she's so ugly. I thought that the acting was very poor. The acting is what makes it bad. It just didn't seem like anyone cared about the movie. They seemed to be pretending to care about it. Anyways, this movie is a total waste of time.

The Master (2012) The best movie I've seen in a long time! 2 April 2012 - 2 out of 8 users found this
 This is a horrible "tribute" to the bible as well as the gospel. It is filled with many things which are not only uncalled for, but also completely ridiculous. The characters are completely unbelievable, from the 'hero' to the 'villain' to the 'heroine'. The 'hero' and 'heroine' are both complete fools, the 'villain' is a little better, but still a complete jerk. The 'villain' seems to be trying to get the attention of the 'hero' but is not getting it. I have never read the bible, but I have read a lot of books on the bible, and I do not recall any of the characters portrayed here as being true to the gospel. I felt like I was reading a parody (kind of like the "South Park" episode ''Jesus vs. Frosty'') of the Bible. Although the names of the characters are different, the book is essentially the same as the bible and goes into many of the subjects that the bible covers. The film is not good and I wouldn't recommend it.

 Yes, this is a true story, and yes, the main characters were real people. But the movie is so badly done that I would not recommend it to anyone. It is tedious and horrible. I think the reason for this is that the actors are just not good enough to pull off the characters. The main actress is probably the worst actress I've ever seen. I don't know how she got the part in this movie. In addition, the director is clearly not a good director. The camera work is terrible and the editing is even worse. The whole movie is like a bad dream. I actually wanted to vomit several times as I watched this movie. I cannot believe that anyone would believe this movie is real.

I cannot believe that the director is still in business.

If you are looking for a truly good documentary, I suggest "Wings of Hope" by Chris Hegedus. You will not find anything as painful or horrible as this movie.

The entire audience was laughing at this movie the entire time. We had a hard time sitting through the entire thing.

Avoid this movie at all costs.

 I saw this film on TV and was totally appalled by it. I just couldn't believe the direction they had taken this movie. It was on a channel that is known for giving air time to low class films, so I didn't think I would be surprised by what I saw. The acting was horrible, the script was ridiculous, the direction was awful and the ending was so stupid. I've seen far worse films, but this one was just awful. I'm surprised the ratings are so high, because this film was well below average. I'm going to keep watching some of the others from the same channel, since they seem at least interesting. This film was a waste of time and money.

 The Wicker Man is a good example of what is wrong with the British film industry. They have a tendency to bother with the same story over and over again, borrowing heavily from one another, and make the same mistakes over and over again. The Wicker Man is a good example of that. It is a dull, slow, plodding story without enough suspense to keep you interested from minute to minute. The story is so "out there" and predictable that you can figure out what the plot is going to be about about two-thirds of the way through the film. There is a lot of great acting in this film, but it is wasted. The plot is so predictable that you can guess what is going to happen about two-thirds of the way through. If you are looking for a good story to spend a couple of hours with, then this is the film for you. If you are looking for a good film, this is not the film for you.

 This film is not one of the worst movies I've seen. It is far, far worse than that. I've seen a lot of terrible movies, but this one ranks at the bottom of the heap. I would rate it at a 1 out of 10. It is not even worth that. I'm not going to waste my time giving a rating or a comment at all. Fox is the worst company to ever make a movie. The script is one of the worst I've ever seen. The scenes are unpleasant, the acting is poor and the special effects are pathetic. The only thing that saves this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is a guy named Michael Copon. He is the only decent actor in the movie and he is paid way too much money for his unbearable performance. The other actors are paid way too much for their awful performances. I'm not going to give any more details about the movie, because it is the worst movie I've ever seen. I would rate it at a 1 out of 10. I'm not even going to waste my time commenting on it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of schlocky, low-budget B movies, stay away from this one. If you

The story by George Lucas is also very good, and the acting is good at times, but this is a very long video, and the children are forced to go over and over the same thing.<br /><br />I gave it a 6 because the story was good, and the acting was good at times, but there was just too much of the same thing, and too much repetition of the same story.<br /><br />I would skip this one.

 I watched the first few minutes of this movie and I knew this was going to be a very bad movie. The first scene starts off with a bunch of people getting run over by a train and it goes on like this for another twenty minutes. Including the first few minutes where the people get run over by the train. This might not be the worst movie ever but it sure is the most boring and pointless movie ever. The only reason why I watched this movie was because I was bored and it was on TV. I could have watched paint dry for the same amount of time. I'm not sure who this movie was made for. If you want to watch a movie that is completely pointless then this is the movie for you. If you're expecting a movie about kids then you will be disappointed because there are no kids in this movie. If you want a movie that is so bad that it's good then this is the movie for you. This movie is so bad that it's good.

 The only thing that is good about this movie is the music at the beginning. It's a shame that the movie is so bad, I'm afraid that I may have to listen to the end of this film to see what all the fuss is about. It's like a comedy version of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and "The Twilight Zone". The acting is terrible, and the plot is completely cliche and stupid. The only reason I watched the whole thing is because all of the actors are gay and I thought it would be fun to see what all the fuss is about. I thought the film was going to be better than it was, but now that I've seen it all the way through I see why it's so bad. It was just a waste of my time.

 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I did not enjoy watching it at all, and I have seen many. The acting is horrible, and the plot is beyond ridiculous. There are many plot points that are not even resolved, and the ending is very weak. The only reason I kept watching was to see if it would get any better, but it never did. The acting is so bad I could not even laugh at any of the jokes, the plot is just nonsensical, and the ending is a total let down. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, on the contrary, if you are looking for a great comedy/drama, this is not it.

 Despite some promising moments, this film is horribly disappointing. The acting is amateurish. The script is funny in parts but only when it can be stretched beyond its capacity. The direction is poor, with scenes that don't add to the story, but feel like the filmmaker was trying to make them more interesting than they really were. There are even a couple of scenes that seem to last forever, but are really just filler. The end result is a film that doesn't deliver on any of its promises, instead leaving you with a feeling of "What was the point?" In fact, it's worth noting that this is one of the few films that I have seen that could have benefited from a better editor.

The film starts with three guys meeting to set up the deal of the century: they are going to buy a huge block of land and turn it into an amusement park. At first, they think they've got a good thing going. But as they get to know the land, they realize they are in over their heads. Soon they are forced to make some difficult decisions.<br /><br />There are a few scenes in the film that are genuinely funny. But it's a shame that these are so few and far between
 The first time I saw this film was in the UK and I was impressed with the film. It was a top-notch thriller with a great story and believable characters and was a lot of fun to watch. The story found me again the second time I saw it and I was equally impressed. I had forgotten however that the film is supposed to be set in the 1950's and I remember the scene where the main character is at a party and the man behind him is wearing a suit that looks like it belongs in the 1950's. I was sure that was supposed to be a mistake but I watched the film again and it was set in the 1950's as well. I'd left the first time with the impression that the film was set in the 1950's and had completely forgotten about that until I saw the film for a third time. If you haven't yet seen this film, I'd recommend you check it out. It's a good film but it's not at all what it's supposed to be.

 My biggest problem with "Last Exit to Brooklyn" is that it really is no masterpiece. It has its moments, but it also has many flaws. It's also a film that should have been remembered as a cult film but was instead remembered as a mainstream film. It's a shame that it's only remembered as a cult film, because "Last Exit to Brooklyn" is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. It's also one of the most important films of the 1960s. In fact, I would argue that it is one of the most important films of all time. I've seen many important films, but I've never seen a film as important as this film. "Last Exit to Brooklyn" is the first film to deal with assimilation into white society. It's the first film to deal with the problems of the black community. It's the first film to deal with the horrors of racism. It's the first film to deal with the problems of a crime ridden black community. Years after it's release, it is still one of the most important films to be released in America. In a way, it's a film that's as important as "Birth of a Nation." The problems of racism and the problems
 ...why in the world did anyone ever want to see this movie? The plot was so convoluted and the dialog so stilted and lame (one might think the characters were actors reading their lines) I could not get past the first 15 minutes. The movie was so bad, I almost didn't want to see it to the end, but I had rented it, so I did. It seemed to get worse and worse.<br /><br />I will warn you, if you are looking for a good movie, don't rent this. If you are looking for a bad movie, this is it.

Boring, Boring, Boring. I'll give the movie a 6, because I saw it in the theater, and it was pretty good in the theater. But, the DVD just isn't worth the $10.00 I paid for it. I wish I had rented it, instead of buying it. I don't want to be like the guy in the movie who made fun of the stars. I'm not making fun of the stars, really. I just think the movie was pretty cheesy.

 I say this with all due respect to Mr. Williams, but this film is fucking terrible. I've read all of the reviews here and most of them are pretty good. Most of you seem to appreciate the artistic talent of Williams. The problem is that he just can't seem to figure out what kind of film he wants to make. This is probably the worst of the films he's made. The first half is almost an educational film, full of historical detail and what not. The second half, which is the more interesting part, is completely different from the first half. It was all just so boring. I mean, what is this, a documentary? I thought it was a comedy. There's no real plot, or character development, or anything. The acting is horrible, the editing is awful, and the directing is just plain bad. The beginning of the film is very educational, but it's all about the same thing. About the same thing. It's just boring. The ending is like a completely different movie. It's completely different from the rest but it's still boring. And what's with the war footage? The editing is horrendous and the whole thing is just so boring. I mean, it's a very important
 This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was just another movie about a high school kid who gets into a fight with a bully and the kid gets his ass kicked. The kid then goes on a revenge rampage, kills the bully's parents, and kills the rest of the gang, and then he goes after the bully and finally kills him. What is with this movie that it is so horrible? Oh yeah, the acting, the graphics, the music, everything! I can't believe that this movie is NOT a hit. I've seen worse movies but this one is really bad. Like I said, this movie is HORRIBLE. Come on people, don't waste your time.

 I have to say, I'd have been very disappointed in anyone who would have given this film a positive review. This could have been a really great movie, but unfortunately it was not. I won't be watching it again. The only reason I saw this is because my husband wanted to watch something. I'm not into horror, so I wasn't too excited about it. They did a great job on the acting, but it was all extremely cheesy. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm sure it's made for teenagers, but I'm still a teenager and I found this movie to be childish. The movie was pretty slow and boring. The movie had some good scenes, but it was all very cliché. This movie had a lot of good ideas, but it just didn't pull it off. The movie was about a girl who's sister goes missing. The family can't find her and they are forced to go to a house to stay. The house is haunted. There are some good scenes, but the overall movie was just really cheesy. The movie was really slow, but it was really good. I wouldn't have complained if I didn't have a chance to catch this movie. This movie was really cheesy and
 This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have been a huge fan of the movie from the start and have watched it many times. The movie is of poor quality and has no plot whatsoever. The acting was horrible, especially the main character's acting. I would give this movie 0/10.

I would like to say that it is not a movie worth watching. It is a waste of time and money. I would give this movie 0/10.

 I still can't believe this movie was made. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen...ever. I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this one takes the cake. The storyline is so cheesy, that I found myself laughing out loud. The acting is bad, and the sound effects really detract from the movie. This movie would have been better if it was a spoof on a bad movie, like "The Room", or "Mystery Science Theater 3000". This movie has no redeeming qualities and should not be seen by anyone.

 This movie is about a group of young people who go to a remote island to party and get laid. The beach scenes are ok if you like that sort of thing, but the beach scenes are only about 20% of the movie. The rest is about what happens on the island. They party and get laid. They drink and get drunk. They party some more and get laid. It's all good. There is some nudity and they do their thing. But there is no story and no point. So it's not much of a movie. It's not even worth the rental price. I think it would have been better as a movie trailer.

This movie is not worth your time and I really don't recommend it. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because there is a scene where a girl is being attacked by a shark and it's pretty cool. It's like a parody of Jaws. The only shark in the film is a fake. But it's the only good thing about this movie.

I give this movie Zero out of Five stars.

 For a movie that is supposed to be a satire, it sure doesn't seem like it. In fact, it just seems like a cheap attempt to put a girl on for the sake of having a girl, the main character is such a blow hard, the whole movie seems phony. The only thing that might redeem it are the pretty good special effects and the sets.<br /><br />The story involves a teenage girl who is a total airhead, who runs away from home, is picked up by some bad guys, who take her to a circus, and there she finds herself in the middle of a vampire theme, and she gets involved in some mad man's plan to steal a goddess. I have no idea what the heck is going on, but it's a pretty lame movie.

 This show is just an example of what TV has become these days, a bunch of people sitting around waiting for the next sexual escapade. The show is not funny, the characters are nothing new, the plot is not interesting and the only thing that comes to mind is the fact that some people are always looking for something to watch.

I have to say that I did not expect much from this show and I was indeed disappointed when I saw it first. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that I thought I would see something new and fresh and that I would be able to get into the show and follow along. I was wrong. I think that this show could have been very interesting if it had been done right. However, the show is so bad that you really can't follow along or care about the characters. I was thinking the same thing as you and that I would like to see something that is out of the ordinary, but it doesn't seem to be the case with "Friends".

I hope that things change for the better and that more shows will be out there that are more entertaining than this one.

 The Simpsons is one of the best shows on TV, but it is actually enjoyable to watch. This movie is a direct result of the writers and producers clearly not understanding what makes this show work. It's just a big waste of time and money. The jokes are either not funny or lame. The characters are not developed, and the plot is a mess. It's just a big mess of a movie.

I will never understand why the producers are so excited about making movies based on the Simpsons. It is no secret that the show is a parody of the old sitcoms like Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley. Now, Laverne and Shirley (the series) was an incredible show. I think it's one of the best sitcoms ever. The problem is that they did not take any of the good things from the show and made a movie. The Simpsons is a parody of the sitcoms of the 70's and 80's. The Simpsons is not a parody of the show Laverne and Shirley. It's a parody of the show Happy Days. The writers and producers don't seem to get this, so they just make a mess of a movie.

The movie is just not funny. The humor
 So, a year ago when I saw the video preview for "The Day After Tomorrow" on Cinemax, I thought, "Man, they're trying to make some serious climate change movie here." I went to the theater to check it out, and I was completely wrong.<br /><br />The movie was total crap. I was so disappointed, I was sure I was going to write a bad review, but I didn't. I have to tell you, I have been a movie critic for a long time, and I have to say, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't know how, but it was. It was all about how the scientists can accurately predict the future based on the data coming in from all over the planet. It was all about how the scientists are all wrong, and the weather is just a random fluctuation of nature. Well, I'm here to tell you something. Those scientist are not wrong.<br /><br />The next day after seeing "The Day After Tomorrow," I woke up at two in the morning, and the first thing I did was to go to the internet and see if anyone else was saying that the movie was so bad. I found out
 I watched it, just to see what all the fuss was about. It was a very poor movie, and it seemed to me that the actors didn't even try to act. Which, when you watch a movie, you expect both the actors and the directors to try to act.<br /><br />It took me a long time to watch this movie, and by the time I got to it, I was really tired and didn't have the patience to sit through it. I'm glad I watched it, though, because it is a very bad movie.

<br /><br />I'd have to give it -1 out of 10. I'm thinking of giving it a -2, but I think that's being cruel to the actors, for whom I'll give a -1.

<br /><br />So, I give it a -1.

<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it at least.

<br /><br />I wonder who the actors were?

<br /><br />I wonder if they were actually acting?

<br /><br />I wonder if they were in the movie for any reason?

 Even the name of this movie reveals something of the content: "Clown House." It's a very short film and it doesn't take long to realize that it's not really about clowns at all, but about a man who has outlived his usefulness. The apartment he lives in is a factory for making clowns. These clowns are meant to entertain the guests at a party, but they end up terrorizing the young couple who are renting the apartment. The movie starts out as a humorous story but quickly degenerates into a series of horror scenes, much of it derived from the "Tales from the Crypt" series. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete waste of time is the acting, which is OK. The movie uses cheesy special effects and squibs of blood, but that only adds to the air of horror. Not recommended.

 I'm Canadian, and I just moved to the US. I noticed that all the TV stations in the US air this movie as an episode of "MASH". It's not. This is a total rip-off of "MASH", and that's not even the worst of it.<br /><br />This movie is dreadful. The actors are not even good; they're just the same. The plot is bad too. It's just a bad knock off of "MASH". The only good thing about this movie is that the director of the show is involved.<br /><br />Go to a US TV station and ask them to air one episode of "MASH" instead of this, and they won't be able to. It's just a poor knock-off. Just avoid this movie.

 I was a big fan of the Matrix series and was looking forward to seeing the first film in the Matrix series. When I saw the trailer for this movie I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I love all the special effects in the movie and the action scenes, but I was hoping for a little more. Then, I saw the movie and was not disappointed at all. I found the movie action packed and entertaining to watch. The story was good and the acting was pretty good, which is always a plus. I think the movie is worth a watch once in your life, but be sure you have seen all of the Matrix films first. I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Also, I can't wait to watch the next movie in the series!

 This was a very poor television broadcast of the play "A Midsummer Night's Dream" by William Shakespeare. The set was dark and dingy, the actors were boring and the pace was slow. But the worst part of this show was that the subtitles were horrible - the actors had to pause several times to correct the subtitles! This was a bad, bad show.

 The film was so bad that I actually kept on watching it. It was cheap, it was badly directed, it was poorly produced and the cinematography was bad. The acting was also terrible, with the main protagonist looking like a stoned kid, as well as all the other actors. The whole thing was so bad, that I couldn't stop watching it. I knew it was going to be bad, but I just couldn't stop watching it, and the whole film was like a big train wreck, with the characters constantly dying or being injured, or the camera getting stuck in the mud, or the film crew running out of money, etc. I mean, the whole thing was so bad, that I even got laugh out loud at some points, but I just couldn't stop watching it. This film is so bad, that it's actually funny. I don't know how else to describe it. It's so bad, that it's funny.

I don't know what I would say to someone who actually liked this film. I mean, it's so bad that it's funny, and yet I can't stop watching it - so it must be funny, right? So, I don't know how to describe it
 This film has no place in the history of cinema as a piece of art or a piece of entertainment and/or a piece of history. It has no place. It's crap. It's only purpose is to show us how much money they can make by making a low budget movie with a large amount of money and a lot of special effects.<br /><br />I was so tired of seeing this kind of crap that I'm going to rate this. It's crap, it's not art. It's a waste of time, it's something you'll get tired of after 5 minutes. It's a way for a poor guy to make a lot of money.<br /><br />It's also a piece of history because, as soon as I saw it, I thought: "this is as bad as any of the "great" movies I've seen". It's just not that good. I can't believe such a bad movie can be such a huge success.

 I saw this film on TV a few nights ago, and was underwhelmed by it. The plot is good, but it drags and the acting is quite poor.<br /><br />The film had a lot of potential, with the plot about a young girl who is kidnapped and held hostage in a strange place. The plot is also good in that she is able to communicate with her family through a TV program, and they are able to enter the room where she is held. However, the film was not very interesting.<br /><br />The film was quite predictable, with the sequences that were shown being shown in a different order. Also, the film was quite amateurish, with the film looking like it was a student film. Finally, the film was quite slow, and the character was not very likeable. <br /><br />Overall, I thought the film was quite poor, and would not recommend this film to anyone.

 The movie was alright, but it was really, really hard to figure out how all the parts fit together. The ending was completely unbelievable. And the movie was kind of boring. But it was alright. I guess. I'm not sure. I think I'd watch it again.

The film is about a girl who is obsessed with a boy. She goes to a social worker to get help. The social worker can't help her because her obsession is just normal teenage stuff. The girl goes to a psychiatrist who can't help her either. The girl starts to get really crazy.<br /><br />It's an okay movie. I don't really like it, but I don't hate it. I think it's kind of a chick flick. But it's not really a chick flick. It's just an okay movie. It's kind of boring. But it's okay.

 This movie has a lot of the typical issues that plague low budget horror flicks. Bad acting, bad story, bad effects, and cheap looking sets. The movie was a bit of a soap opera with a few horror sequences interspersed throughout. The worst part about this movie is that it actually took themselves seriously. The film didn't rely on cheap laughs and cheap scares, it relied on pretentiousness and bad acting. I'm not sure what the director was smoking when he wrote this, but he should have been high when he wrote it. I only saw this movie to see one thing, and that was the character Marion. Marion has the most memorable role of any character in the movie. She was the perfect example of a bit of a ditzy, moronic, and insecure woman. She was the perfect woman for Daryl to talk to and get advice from. She was a complete ditz who was always doing something wrong, but never learning from her own mistakes. She was the perfect example of how an insecure woman can be so destructive. She was the character I wanted to see get ripped apart by the possessed Daryl. She was the character I wanted to see go down in a blaze of glory. And I was so disappointed
 I couldn't give this movie a 1. It was very good in parts but the plot was all over the place and it was very hard to follow. I felt like I was watching a different film at different times. I was very confused by the time I got to the end. I also found it very hard to believe that the same guy could have been in all the scenes, even when the police weren't investigating the case. The poor acting was the biggest problem. I have never seen a movie where the actors talked like that. They had no emotion and no connection to the audience. I was very disappointed. I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell very short of it.

 This was, for me, the worst movie I've seen in years! The plot is so unrealistic and unbelievable, you can't believe a single word of it. The acting is sub-par at best, and the camerawork is amateurish and annoying. The plot is just so far-fetched, it couldn't exist, even in a dream. The only thing the movie has going for it is the fact that there are some pretty decent and well-done computer graphics, and the fact that there was a lot of gore. Overall, this is a movie that should have been left on the cutting room floor, and not even shown to the public. I can't believe this movie was released in theaters. It's not just a bad movie, it's a bad film. Not recommended.

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie. I do not wish for you to watch it, but I would love to share it with you. The acting is superb and the story is great.

 This movie isn't scary, it's not funny and it's not really much of a horror movie. It's a terrible movie that was made just to make money. The acting is horrible and the story, which is based on a true story, just doesn't make sense. The biggest problem with this movie is that it has a couple of decent scenes, but then just ruins the whole thing with horrible acting, bad dialogue and a stupid story. Even if you think you are the perfect person to watch this movie, you shouldn't. The only people who will like this movie and like it for the right reasons are people who are looking for a movie that isn't even remotely scary, but this movie doesn't even come close to being scary. The only thing good about this movie is the fact that it has a couple of decent scenes and there is some nudity in the movie. The nudity isn't really that bad, but it doesn't really set the mood, it just happens to be in the movie and it's obvious that the nudity was just used to make the movie look more interesting. When the movie is over you'll probably be wondering how they managed to make such a bad movie, but they did. This is one of the worst
 This movie is definitely a must see if you are a true fan of the Tunes and his music. It's not really a movie that you would want to watch more than once. It may be worth watching a second time but you will get more out of it the first time. It's a documentary of the life of a great soul singer and the trials and tribulations he went through to get to where he was. This movie is not about the music but about the person himself and his life. The movie is extremely well done and is a must see for all true fans of the Tunes. I personally found it to be very touching and I know that I am not alone in this. I would definitely recommend this movie to any fans of the Tunes. I'm sure that you'll be able to relate to the Tunes' story and his trials and tribulations in life.

The movie is very well done and it is obvious that the director did his homework and did a very thorough job in this documentary. The cinematography is great and very artistic. The music is the best part of the soundtrack and I think the music is the best part of this movie. I am a big fan of the Tunes and I can

I can't believe this is a movie that is on the IMDB. I would give it a 0 out of 10. I can't even imagine how bad this movie is. It's so bad that i don't even want to waste my time watching it. I recommend this movie to no one. I would not watch this movie if it was the last movie on earth. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.

 A number of years ago I went to a matinee of this movie and afterwards, I asked some of the people who went with me why they had gone. One person's answer was that he wanted a good movie to see as a break from reality. I was disappointed. The movie was only slightly better than some of the lower level televison movies that are run daily. The story was puerile, the dialog stilted, the characters were two dimensional, and the acting was nothing to get excited about. The only good thing about this movie was the little girl who played the daughter.<br /><br />The movie is about a group of college kids who are on an adventure to find a lost city.

The guide kidnaps the daughter of one of the kids and it is up to the daughter and the others to rescue her. The guide, the daughter, and the group set out on the journey to recover the gold.<br /><br />There are a number of things that prevent this movie from being
 This movie is a "true" story (based on a true story). It is my opinion that the actors chosen for this movie did not have the acting ability that would have made this movie believable. The plot is about a rich family in a small town in Russia. The family is so wealthy that they own a boat, a small zoo, a house full of servants, and a beautiful, rich estate. The father and mother are completely devoid of anything resembling a sense of humor, and the daughter is a spoiled brat. The exact purpose of this movie is unclear, but the premise was to show the "evil" side of Soviet Russia, and it fails miserably. It doesn't really seem to be about the brutality of the Soviet regime, it seems more like a sad tale of a spoiled rich family, and the poor servants who have to put up with it. The movie itself is very slow, and I believe it's lack of plot is due to the lack of a believable story. If the movie had been set in the U.S., with a wealthy family, and the father was a billionaire, and the mother and daughter were spoiled brats, then this movie would have been more believable. The family is so wealthy and
 This is a very pretentious and very boring movie. It is not funny at all (or maybe even unintentionally funny), the acting is terrible, and the plot is weak. There are too many plot holes (who is the real criminal and why?). I would say that this is a movie for old people, and a movie for people who are too embarrassed to go to the theater and watch a movie when it is released in the cinema. The only good thing about this movie is the score by Ennio Morricone, which is awesome. But that's about it.

8/10

Rated R for language and some sexuality.

 I was hoping this movie would be interesting and have some good actors. But instead, I found a movie I wish I had not seen. The story was terrible and the acting was sub par. I can't really even list it as the worst movie I have ever seen. It was just awful. There was a scene where the main character had a gun in his mouth and then he shot himself. I'm not sure if the gun was real or not, but it sure looked fake. I think if I had the time I would have checked to see if it was real or if it was a prop. The only good thing about the movie was the fact that it was short. That was the only good thing about it. I would like to give it a 0 rating. I would like to see the director/producer of this movie be fired.

The story is about a serial killer, which is the first thing that was not good about it. The story is about a serial killer who has a kid. The story is about the kid, who has been trained by his father to be a serial killer. The father is a serial killer and the kid grows up to
 This movie was awful. I have never seen a movie that was so fake. I watched this movie on the SyFy channel and I had to turn it off because I could not stand it. I am a male and this movie was so stupid. The acting was awful and the story line was awful. I am not sure why this movie was so popular. When it first came out I heard about it and thought it would be fun to watch. I tried to watch it twice but could not stand it. The only good thing about the movie was the "Fellowship" cat. I have the DVD and it was awful. I am not sure why is was released. I would never buy it, I would not even rent it, and I would not recommend it to anyone!

 For all the hype, I did not like this movie at all. It was just a bunch of mugging and it didn't seem to be in the spirit of the old movies. I did not enjoy it either in the theater or when I viewed it on DVD. I was expecting a bit more of a feel of the old movies, but got none.

I loved the other movies in this series and would like to see another one. But I'm not sure if I will watch this one again. If you like the old movies, you might like this one.

 This movie is a complete mockery of Christianity. I'm not sure why, but there's something about a guy who looks like a caricature of a Southern Baptist that really gets under my skin. I'm not sure if that's because I'm a Baptist, or because I'm an atheist, but this movie just rubbed me the wrong way. The characters are all one-dimensional, the plot is weak and amateurish, and the message is weak. I also think that this movie was made with the intention of being funny, which it isn't. If you're looking for a movie about the intricacies or morals of Christianity or the life of Jesus, this isn't it. This movie is a waste of time.

Rent it, don't buy it.

I'm not a "Christian" and I don't believe in Jesus Christ. But I do believe in God. I believe that God is real, and that He loves us. I'm sure that there are many people out there who believe the exact same thing. But I'm also sure that there are many people who don't.

I'm sure that there are many people out there who would like to see a movie that doesn't show Jesus in the
 I had read a lot of good things about this movie, so I was expecting a lot.<br /><br />I can't say for sure why I didn't like it, but I think it was because it didn't feel like a movie to me. I've never felt that way about a movie before. It felt more like a documentary. Which is not a bad thing necessarily, but I was expecting a little more. It was a good movie, and I hope they make more.<br /><br />I think it's a good start though.<br /><br />It was good, a little slow at times, but good.

<br /><br />I would give it a 7 out of 10.

<br /><br />I would like to see more.

<br /><br />I would definitely watch more.

<br /><br />I would recommend it to others.

<br /><br />I would watch it again.

 This film is about a man who can communicate with the dead. I liked the idea of the film but i was disappointed that they used a lot of the same old cliche stuff. I would have liked to see more originality in the story and make something different out of it. I also thought that the actors were wooden and not believable as the characters. This film is not scary at all and i expected a lot more from it. I felt like i was watching a B movie and not a horror film. It was not scary, not scary at all. There was nothing original in this film. It was just the same old thing over and over again. I would not recommend this film to anybody. I give it a 1 out of 10.

I had to take off one because it was not scary.

I feel like this film was not scary at all, it was a little bit creepy but it was not scary at all. There was a lot of violence in this film and it was not scary at all. It is just a very disappointing film. I was disappointed that there was not much originality in the film.

It was a very boring film, I did not find it scary at all. There
 I don't normally write negative reviews, but I just saw this film and had to say something. I can't believe anyone can give this film a positive review. I have seen many documentaries and some of them don't have a story line that makes sense. But this film is just one big disjointed mess. I feel sorry for the people who made this movie and the people who had to sit through it. I am pretty sure I will never see anything that has to do with the Holocaust ever again. If you are going to make a film about something this important, it should be well done. This was not. I am very sorry for the people who had to produce and direct this film. I gave this film a zero for effort and a zero for execution. In my opinion, it is NOT a documentary. It's a documentary pretending to be a documentary. If this is the best you can do, you should not be making films.

 As an American who lived through the '60s, I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was with this film. I can only imagine how disappointing it was to the audience who saw it in the theatres. I've read so many reviews from people who say this is the best film ever. Well, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. This has to be the worst film I've ever seen. <br /><br />For those of you who have seen the film, you'll understand what I'm saying. It's as if I was watching a bad episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. The only thing this film has that Star Trek doesn't is the fact that it's set in the '60s. Otherwise, this mess is just as bad as any other episode of TNG. <br /><br />The script is so dull that you'll begin to feel bored after a while. The actors' performances are so bad that you'll begin to feel ill. The camera work is so amateurish that you'll be tempted to vomit. <br /><br />In short, don't waste your time on this. Watch something else.

 A very poor movie. I had to watch it twice to make sure that I didn't miss anything. The first time I watched it I actually thought it was a documentary on the making of the movie. I thought they were just interviewing the people involved and then they would be talking in front of a black screen. So first the movie is an hour long documentary on the making of the movie then it becomes a movie. I guess the producer of the movie wanted to make a movie about the making of the movie. I thought the movie was too long and boring. I thought the movie was too slow. There were times when I thought I saw the same scene twice. That scene was a video which I think depicted the people who were involved in making the movie. The movie was stupid. The acting was terrible. The movie was boring. The movie was crazy.

 I don't wish to be too harsh, but this movie is garbage. I have to admit that I usually have no problems with "bad" movies. I even enjoy some of the bad ones that I've seen. But this movie is an exception. It's terrible. I was so bored with the movie that I actually fell asleep - and I've seen plenty of bad movies. The acting is below average (I can't even say the actors "piss me off" or give me a "bad vibe" - you know what I mean?) The plot is awful. The dialogue is terrible. The music is just plain bad. The "effects" are laughable (the scene where the car explodes is just plain funny) The most important thing: the movie is boring. I couldn't even pay attention to the movie, because I was so bored. I don't know how they managed to make a boring movie.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 out of 10.

 I watched this movie based on the box cover and trailer. I was expecting a horror movie with a few jump scares. But I was wrong. The movie was just boring, stupid, and completely unable to deliver any scares at all. The acting was very low-budget, the script was childish and insipid, and the overall atmosphere was very eerie and creepy. The movie was predictable. There were so many moments that were clearly staged. There is a scene where the heroine is walking down the hall, and it appears that she is alone. But then she turns around and sees a dark figure standing there. It is not very effective. There are scenes that are completely unreal, and they just made it worse. The movie could have been good if the plot was better, or if the director tried a little harder. But the plot was bad enough to make the movie unbearable. I usually try to watch a horror movie for the characters, and for the scares. But in this case, neither of those two things were even remotely successful. If you're looking for a scary movie for Halloween, then this is not the one for you.

1 out of 5 stars.

 This movie is a prime example of how the studios treat female characters. In this movie, they don't even bother to make her own character. We are simply supposed to hate her. But hate her, we do! The movie starts off with a woman waking up in a hospital bed. She is suffering from amnesia. The movie then jumps to the present where we meet a woman named Rachel (Jodie Foster). This woman is an alcoholic who is a school guidance counselor. One day she gets a phone call and goes to a party where she meets a man named Michael (Billy Bob Thornton). She is attracted to him and they have an affair.<br /><br />The movie really doesn't have anything to do with the love story between these two. The only emotion I felt was jealousy from Rachel's relationship with Michael. One of the most disgusting parts of the movie was the scene where Rachel and Michael come home from a party and get into bed. They have sex in front of the kids. For some sick reason, the children start screaming, resulting in Rachel's screaming back at them.<br /><br />The movie was also too slow. I was watching the movie and thinking to myself, "How long is this movie
 I guess I don't get it. I mean, the movie has an interesting premise, and the acting is fine. But the whole thing just feels so... blah. I mean, even the music sounds like a tired melody. For some reason the movie just really turns me off. I guess that's the best way to describe it. The movie itself is fine, but it's just not interesting enough. The characters just aren't compelling. I guess that's the point, but still. The movie as a whole just doesn't have enough oomph. The ending is particularly weak, and frankly, I was getting bored by the time the movie ended. The dialogue was also pretty weak throughout. It's a shame the movie is so underwhelming, because it has some fine actors in it. I just don't think the movie works. I'm giving it a 4/10.

 I have a feeling that this movie was made to be a cheap sequel to the original, but failed to attract the audience.<br /><br />The fashions and settings are very reminiscent of the original, so much so that it seems as if the movie was made with the original in mind. However, the story is nothing more than a rehash of the original, with the exception that there is a love interest in this one. The cast, although unremarkable, is not nearly weak enough to compensate for the shortcomings of the script.

I am afraid that you will not find much entertainment here. The only thing that will make you forget the pain of watching it is the beautiful scenery.

This is the worst sequel ever made (I'm not joking)!!

Totally unrelated totally.

The characters are just not interesting, the story is totally boring and the movie is so slow.

If you have liked the original you will probably like this too.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Even if you like the original you will probably be disappointed.

 I'm not normally the kind of person to write bad reviews, but this one is stupendously bad. I mean, beyond the fact that it's a painfully bad movie. I saw it in the theater, and it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's basically a Michael Bay film with a few more people and less explosions. Sure, it's got a pretty cool background and a good hero, but the action is terrible. And, more importantly, it's got a terrible villain. I mean, really... the villain is really amazing. He's obviously a skilled martial artist, but he's also an evil guy who knows all of the tricks. He comes off as a little pathetic, and his plan to rule the world isn't that great, but the main villain is just a little bit pathetic. Also, the bad guys are a little too focused on killing people. The main villain is a little too evil and a little too focused on killing, and the bad guys are a little too focused on killing. They're all evil and sad, but mostly evil and sad. Also, the main villain is kind of annoying, but the movie is kind of annoying. All in all, it was a bad
 A little bit of the film is about a young girl who is left alone by her parents at the beach. She is soon befriended by a young man who claims he is from a neighboring island. She grabs his hand and is pulled into the sea, where they are attacked by a shark. The shark kills the man, but the girl is saved by a diver who works for the island's marine institute and who has a relationship with the girl's mother. The girl ends up staying on the island with the institute's director where she learns to cope with her fears of the sea. A quick story but it is well acted and directed. Unfortunately the shark is a CGI creation that doesn't seem to fit with the film. The actor who plays the director is totally wasted and yet the film is not a total waste of time. It would have been a better film if it had been about the director who teaches the girl how to cope with her fear of the sea. The director doesn't seem to learn anything and seems to be played for laughs.

 A film about a German woman who comes to America and marries a man who is Jewish. At first, she's not too happy with it and tries to stay away from him.

 A film about friendship and love, but is it? <br /><br />This film is about a group of friends that meet in a college and become best friends. However, one of the friends is gay and starts to come out about his sexuality. The film does a great job in showing the friendship and love between the friends, but it starts to make the film a bit confusing. This film took an idea that just wasn't believable. I don't understand why the writers didn't run with the idea and make it a great film. This film was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it is a drama that is boring.

I think that this film would be great if it wasn't so dull. I would rate this film a 6 out of 10.

 I must admit that I had tears in my eyes during the entire movie. This is the kind of thing that you expect from the country over the Hollywood. The only chance to see the movie was at the local TV station, which is one of the few channels in my area. I was so happy that I got to see this movie on TV, and I was so excited to see the movie. But after watching the movie for about an hour, I was so disappointed that I was about to throw the TV set out of the window. I could not see the point of this movie. There is no point at all in the movie. There is no reason why anyone would want to watch this movie. The movie has no meaning at all. And the story is so stupid. The only thing good about the movie is the actors. They were very nice to watch. But that was not enough to make up for the lack of meaning. I'm sorry to say this, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

I was very excited to see this movie. I've heard great things about this movie, and I was thrilled
 I'm a big fan of the original "The Devil's Own" and the sequel "The Devil's Own II", but I have to say that this one just doesn't measure up. It's not a bad film, but I just didn't like the way it was put together. There are parts of it that completely failed to make any sense, and there were other parts that were very slow and one-dimensional. The plot was all over the place, and the end, while not bad, was not at all satisfying. It has a few good action sequences, but it is the quality of the acting that really drags this movie down.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is on top form as the leader of a new breed of "enforcers" for the mob. He is a very likable actor and never disappoints, but this is not his best performance. He just doesn't seem to be able to reproduce his usual intensity as he has in his previous films. His co-stars are equally as bad. They are not bad actors, but they just don't have the ability to portray their characters to the same degree that Neeson and Donal Logue do. One character in particular,
 I have to say that I was disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a good movie but, in the end was left with a feeling of disappointment, and a bad taste in my mouth. I just don't know what it is with the way that we Americans see all things as a western. When I saw the title of this movie, I thought it was going to be like "The Last of the Mohicans" with cowboys, horses and Indians, but it was not. The only Indians in this movie were the bad guys. The rest was a strange mix of western and mafia movie. I got bored with the movie, and it was over too soon. I don't know what it is but, when I see a movie, I want to be entertained, and this one was not. Instead of giving this movie an 8, I will give it a 5.

 It's a shame for anybody who really wants to see the film to waste their time watching this. It is a bad movie. I have to admit that I haven't seen all the other Godfather films, so maybe the other stuff is better, but this is just bad.<br /><br />The plot is thin, the dialog is bad and there are no memorable scenes. The acting is bad and the plot is just bad. This is a "so bad it's good" movie, but it's not good. There are a few good lines, but the dialog is just bad. The plot is just bad.<br /><br />I don't know if it is because I have a bad taste in movies or because it's just a bad film, but I wouldn't recommend it. I would recommend the Godfather films, but not this one. I give this one a 1/10.<br /><br />I have to admit that I think the Godfather films are better.

the best gangster film ever

Author: shakethemad from United States

6 November
 I feel like I've seen this story before, but can't quite place it. I'm sure I've seen the actors in other films, but the whole film is kind of a blur in my mind. I know the premise is about a man who is trying to find out who killed his wife, but I don't remember the details. The movie was shot well enough, but there's just something about it that just didn't work for me. I'll probably watch it again sometime, but I'm not sure if I'll go out of my way to do so.

The premise is interesting enough, but it's the execution that's missing. The character of the husband is just too cold and distant, and the main character is just too weak. The whole thing just seemed to be lacking the right amount of tension. I think it's because the film was just too long, which made the whole thing drag on a bit too long.

I don't really have anything else to say about the film, but I'm sure we'll see it around again sometime. Just not sure when.

7/10

I might rewatch it some day, if I can find it.

3/10
 This film is a complete waste of time. The actors are all just awful and the plot is painfully, painfully obvious. This might be funny if it was an episode of the Simpsons or something, but it is just not even worth a rental. Skip it, or rent it and be miserable.

 I must confess that I am a HUGE fan of Van Damme and Bruce Willis, and had been looking forward to seeing this movie for several months. I must say that I was disappointed. It was like it didn't have a good script, the acting was not good, the camera work was amateurish, and the whole thing seemed to be rushed. I would say that this movie is definitely over-hyped and over-priced. Although I was expecting an action-packed movie, I was not really looking for a "smart" movie. Van Damme and Bruce Willis both were not at their best in this movie, and the plot was very weak. The fighting scenes were very amateurish and did not look like real martial arts. I would recommend this movie only to Van Damme and Bruce Willis fans.

I was really disappointed with this movie. I do not know why Van Damme has a reputation for being such a great fighter, because the only fight scenes in this movie seemed very amateurish. I did not like the plot at all, and the acting was not very good. The camera work was amateurish. I would recommend this movie only to Van Damme and Bruce Willis fans.

 I've seen better horror films than this, in fact even though it is a cheap one, it is still a decent one. The film has a good plot, with a lot of suspense and slightly gorey scenes. But the film is too long, and it is hard to follow, mainly because the film seems to be in three different languages, which makes it hard to understand. The film is very confusing, and I don't think anyone could follow it. Although the film is not as bad as I thought it would be, it is a film that I would not recommend, mainly because of the fact that it is a horror film. If you like horror films and you want to see one that is not as bad as the films that are out there now, then watch this.

A decent early 70's film. 3 March 2013

I've seen this movie a few times and I have to say that it isn't that bad, however, compared to other films, such as "The Exorcist" or "The Omen", it isn't that good. The film does have a few nice scenes, and the film is
 At first glance, this film looks like a typical "falling in love in a foreign country" story. The main characters, a young American girl, her Japanese mother and Japanese grand father, are introduced in the pleasant and colorful streets of Kyoto. The father, who is a professor of Japanese literature, is studying the poetry of the Japanese poet Michiyo Yanagihara. At first, they both seem to be happy, but their relationship is already in trouble. The father is in the way of the daughter's desire to go to school in the United States. After graduating from high school, the daughter tries to escape from the family, but does not succeed and returns to Japan, which is not what she wants. In trying to find her father, she goes to the city that he is studying in.The father, who is very ill, tells her that he has killed himself because he did not want his daughter to go to America. In the last scene, the daughter, who is now a young woman, looks at the photo of her father and decides that she will go to America to find her father. The film ends, but the camera stays in the street, which is the Kyoto.

 This film was not at all a good example of Mexican cinema. It was not artistic, or interesting. Most of the film is just a bunch of random scenes showing the Mexican "culture", which was very boring. The violence was not even all that violent, and some of the scenes were just tacky and stupid. I guess the whole idea of this film was to show how Mexican culture is so different from American culture, but this film just showed that Mexican culture is not very different at all. It was not even a good film for those of us who are not familiar with Mexican culture, because it showed so little of Mexico that it was hard to understand what was going on. I was disappointed in this film, and in retrospect I can see that it was a waste of my time, and I am glad that I never saw this film in the theater.

1. The beginning of the film was very boring and slow, and showed so little of Mexico that it was hard to understand what was going on.

 "The Uninvited" is a very bad film. It's a very bad film that also happens to be a very bad horror film. It's certainly not a good film, but it's not a bad film. It's a bad horror film that's about as exciting as a bad horror film can get. "The Uninvited" is full of horrible acting, stupid plot ideas and cheap effects. The best thing about this movie is that the bad acting is so obvious that you can almost hear the people laughing at the screen. The direction is so bad that you can actually see the actors trying to act and failing. The action scenes are so uninteresting that they are actually boring. The only thing that kept me watching was my need to get to the end of this movie. Sure, it's got bad effects, a stupid plot and killing off the heroine in the first five minutes, but it's still a pretty good horror movie.

The acting in "The Uninvited" isn't so bad that you can't tell that it is bad. The acting is horrible. The acting is so bad that you really need to sit back and think about it. The worst of the bad acting is from the son, who
 This is the first film to be produced by the man who brought you the LITTLE RICHARD series. The bit of trivia is that this film is also the first film to involve a talking dog (which is more than can be said for the LITTLE RICHARD series).<br /><br />I have to say that the film is not a total disaster; there are some very nice touches towards the end. The dog is particularly good, and the acting is quite amusing. It is the kind of film that one can enjoy, but it is not likely to be remembered by anybody. The narration at the start is rather long, and doesn't really add anything to the film.

(It is worth remembering that the film was originally released as a silent film).

<br /><br />I'm afraid that the film is hard to rate, as it is so hard to compare it with anything else. It is available on DVD, but I doubt if it would be worth the effort on that basis.

 Stanley Kubrick's last film was a failure. It was over-hyped and over-budgeted, and a box office disaster. The film was not a critical success and became something of a cult favorite. I saw this film when I was younger, and I found it pretty boring. The film's premise is about a man whose father dies in a car accident. With this in mind, Kubrick created a film that had very little to do with the premise. It was a strange film that was difficult to follow, and only some of the characters were interesting. The film was a bore, and I didn't find anything particularly interesting about the characters. I would recommend this film to those interested in films by Stanley Kubrick, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone interested in a film that has an interesting plot.

 The only reason I'm writing this is because I saw the movie. It was a waste of time. I don't know how to describe it any better than that.<br /><br />The plot was terrible. The characters were boring and unbelievable. The nudity was pretty boring. The music was just plain annoying. The acting was bad. The movie was boring. There was nothing positive that I could possibly say about this movie. I've read reviews from other people who saw this movie and some of them actually liked it. I can't imagine why. I suggest that you find another movie to watch. I don't think I'd recommend this movie to anyone.

<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />The plot of the movie was so bad that I'm not even going to talk about it. It was just so stupid. I don't know where to start. The movie starts out with a murder and they find a journal. They decide to start looking into the murders and the journal. They are followed by some strange people. They meet a woman who tells them a story about a woman who was killed by a man that she was sleeping with. They look for the man and find
 The "Hollywood" in Hollywood, Florida is a relatively new addition to the region. It is a very large shopping complex with a movie theater. It is a major attraction for the area, as well as a tourist attraction in the Greater Orlando area. It is also a very popular place for the movie-going public. The theater is one of the most modern and technologically advanced in the country. The parking garage is large, and the parking spaces are in clearly marked areas. The theater itself is very large, with a large screen and plenty of seats. It is in a very good location, with plenty of parking and easy access from the nearby highways. The theater has a good selection of movies, and its prices are reasonable. The only real problem with "The Hollywood" is that it is a relatively new addition to Hollywood, Florida, and as such, is not very popular with the locals. Most people who live in Hollywood or the neighboring towns like Sanford and Winter Park, go to the theater by car, and not by public transportation. Most people living in the area don't have cars, so they rely on public transportation. When they do arrive at the theater, they often find no one else there, and the theater is closed.
 I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has made me so angry. Should have been called "Evil Things Just Happen to Good People."<br /><br />I am also a father, and this movie really scared the crap out of me. I saw it with my teenage son, and I wanted to hit him. I wanted to hit him hard. I was so angry at what was happening to those people in the movie. There was a scene where the mother (played by Christina Ricci) is taken away by the police and says "I am a good mom. I am a good mom." And I sat there and thought 'are you kidding me????'.<br /><br />My wife is not a fan. She said it was not a horror movie, but a drama. I think the only reason this movie got any kind of rating was because it was a horror movie. It was not a horror movie. The actual horror was the situation these two kids (played by Jake and Logan Lerman) were put into.

I am just one person, and I don't know if I am the only person who was offended by this movie, but I am just one person who has spoken up
 I was very disappointed that they brought back this "Joan Crawford" movie. She is supposed to be a top-notch actress, not a washed-up box-office draw whose career is running out. Her acting is flat, her mannerisms are not even in keeping with her portrayal, and the script is ludicrous. The plot is ridiculous, and the "scientific thriller" aspects of the plot were far fetched and unbelievable. The plot just does not hold together, and the acting is not even close to being good. The only redeeming feature was that Joan was really quite handsome in her younger days. I am definitely not a fan of Joan Crawford, and I'm not sure what she was thinking coming back to this type of film. This movie was so bad that it made me wonder if the real Joan Crawford was involved in the production. This is the worst film that Joan Crawford has ever been involved in. I thought her performance in "Clueless" was bad, but this one was worse. She has done much better.

 I loved the original film and was eagerly awaiting a sequel and then this one was released and it was just not the same. I was a bit annoyed that they were trying to make it a prequel to the original film and not so much a sequel. The only thing that has the same feel is the music and the original script was an amazing script but the new one is a bit weak. The characters are not the same and the script is a bit different. This film does not have the same feel as the original and the original had so much more to it. This is a good film with a few laughs but it is not the same and I do not think it could have been made the same way with all the same people involved. It has a few good laughs and some great moments but it is not the same as the original.

 I read the book years ago as a teenager. I always had hoped that the movie would be as good as the book. Unfortunately it was not. I liked the movie but it made some serious mistakes. I have seen the movie three times but only to see if I missed anything. I have just finished watching the movie again, this time with my wife. She has read the book and knows how to spot plot holes and how the movie is not as good as the book. I thought that I would explain why I thought the movie was not that good. If you are looking for a good book to read before seeing the movie, I would recommend: "A Prayer for Owen Meany" by John Irving.

1. The movie did not show the changes in the characters. For example, in the book, Owen and his father get into an argument and his dad tells his son that he's a disappointment. The movie does not show the change in the characters. Instead it shows them on the same level, with their "love" for each other. In the book, Owen's dad has changed a lot. He has become bitter, angry and has lost any love he may have had for his son. 2. The movie did
 I watched this movie with high expectations because of its many excellent reviews. As I started watching, I found the story to be somewhat similar to the plot of the Spongebob Squarepants episode "Friend or Foe" (3rd season) where Spongebob had to battle a giant carrot. There were many other similarities between the two plots. The film does have a few funny parts, and many of the actors do a great job. But overall the story is incredibly weak and the movie is not very funny. It has almost no plot, just a bunch of random gags and jokes. There was one scene near the end were two of the characters talk about the movie and it was very funny; they were talking about how the movie is in black and white and how they thought it was a cartoon and they only had a few minutes to make it. I would give this movie a 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Review by: Chaz
