 I saw this movie yesterday (it's a new release) and I have to say, I loved it. I absolutely loved it. It was a very enjoyable film experience. I don't even know if I can think of anything negative to say about it. <br /><br />Now I'm not a big fan of the romantic comedies, and in fact I could care less about Hollywood movies in general, but I watched this movie as I was leaving work, so I wanted to see if I was going to be entertained. And, man, was I! I laughed, I cried and I got chills. I don't know if this is a good movie or not, I haven't seen it since the theatre, but I know that it was a fun movie. And I'm pretty sure I know why. <br /><br />Pete. <br /><br />Pete is the main character, and I think he's a great character. Very multi-dimensional. He's a very good actor, I've never seen him in anything before, so I have no idea how he's going to do in the future. I don't think he's going to go too far, because he's definitely
 A high-octane, no-holds-barred action-adventure with some of the best actors you'll ever see. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredibly violent movie, but it's not gratuitously so. As disgusting as the idea of an inter-dimensional creature that wants to consume us all may be, the story certainly isn't about that and Sylvester Stallone does an excellent job of keeping it that way. The movie is about the team trying to figure out a way to stop it before it gets here. This is also the story of the team coming together and how they do it. The film is also action-packed and full of thrills, although it is not overloaded with CGI and explosions as some action movies are. It's a little more sophisticated than most action movies and I think it's a much better film than the Rocky movies. It's no surprise that the movie was shot in the Philippines and the film has a very exotic and exotic film feel to it. The movie has a good cast and the acting is excellent. The script is very good, although there are some moments that could be better. The dialogue is also very good. (For instance, when the team is
 This movie is an absolute masterpiece, it's the best work of art I've ever seen. The cinematography, the music, the acting, the style, the writing, everything is perfect. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has had so much meaning and such a profound effect on me. It's a masterpiece and I'd love to see it again.

The story is about a man who is the sole survivor of a plane crash. He is found by a tribe of cannibals who kill the rest of the passengers except for him. He then spends the rest of the movie trying to survive and escape from the cannibals.<br /><br />The style is minimalist, which adds to its atmosphere and gives it a surreal feel. It's also a very dark movie, which adds to its atmosphere as well. The cinematography is also very good, especially the night scenes.<br /><br />The acting is great, especially the cannibals. I am not a big fan of horror movies, but I really enjoyed this one.

The writing is also very good. The dialog is very simple and clear and the story is very well constructed. The movie builds up to a climax,
 It is a good adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories. I think it is very accurate to the stories, except that Holmes smokes a pipe, and Watson doesn't. It is a faithful adaptation of the stories, and it is a very enjoyable movie. It is not full of action, but it is very interesting, and it is a very good movie to watch. I don't think that anyone would be disappointed in watching this movie. This is a great movie.

1.0 out of 5 stars The movie is much better than the book Format: DVD H.G. Wells' Sherlock Holmes stories were great, my favorite of all the Sherlock stories are the ones by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I think the movie is a much better adaptation than the book. The movie shows the character of Sherlock Holmes as he really was, a man who did not take much, who didn't like to talk about his past and who wasn't interested in women. The character of Dr. Watson was also very good in the movie. I think the movie was very faithful to the original story and I like it a lot.

4.0 out of 5 stars Doyle's Holmes wins the war for me. Format: DVD What can I say about
 I saw this movie a few days ago because I love the original and wanted to see if it was any good. I was pleasantly surprised! The acting was good. The story line was interesting and I love the way they pulled it off. I didn't think it was that funny but I'm a guy. Its not a chick flick. I would definitely recommend this movie.

March 9 2010 By TheBos2 - Published on Amazon.com Format: DVD Verified Purchase I saw this movie last night and I liked it. The acting was good and the story was interesting. I liked the way they handled the ending, it was a very good twist. It would have been better if they made it a bit more clear as to who killed Shane, but they didn't. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the original.

 This film is simply a beautiful film to sit back and enjoy. It has a great soundtrack, wonderful acting and has a message for the audience. There is a great message that its ok to be different, to be unique and above all to be yourself. <br /><br />The film is set in Australia and this is where it gets its name. It is filmed in Sydney and the landscapes are great. The acting is wonderful and the characters are very well written. I would recommend this film to everyone, it is just a lovely film to watch. 10/10

 I really enjoyed this movie. It had that feel of a small town movie where everyone gets along. The cast was perfect. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that beautiful blond actress come in as the daughter. It was a great way to see a movie without having to watch TV. I didn't see any of the bad things some others have said. To me, this is a great family movie. I hope they make more like this.

I have seen a lot of negative comments and have to wonder if the bad reviewers haven't seen the movie. It was so much better than I expected and a good family movie.

There is also a sequel to this movie called "The Secret Life of Bees". I haven't seen that yet but am going to.

I give this movie a 9 out of 10.

 i saw this movie when i was 14 and i had never seen such a beautiful story before. i saw it again when i was 19 and was still impressed by the story and the acting. i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies, especially women. the movie is about a young woman named kiara who is traveling in a caravan with her friends and her sisters and her boyfriend kyle. the caravan is attacked by a group of bandits and everyone is killed except for kiara, who is pregnant. she decides to run from the group of men who killed her friends and family and she decides to head to a place where a man named wade lives. wade is a man who has a tribe of people that he protects and he is a warrior. he believes that kiara must die, but he is willing to let her live if she lives with him as his wife and protects his tribe. but as kiara and wade get to know each other, they fall in love and decide to run away together and start a family. the story is about two people who are willing to sacrifice everything for love and the love of another person. it is a beautiful love story with very good acting. i recommend anyone who hasn't seen it

 What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? I have seen it many times, and still it amazes me. It's suspenseful, it's interesting, it's funny, it's real. It's what a great film is supposed to do. It's a classic. I know a lot of people who have seen it, and can't get enough of it. I'm in the process of collecting all the available VHS tapes of this film, and I expect that they'll be worth quite a lot of money by the time I'm done. If you only have a VCR, get the tape, as it's definitely worth having.

8/10

(Also available on DVD, but I never have one, so I can't comment on that.)

The film was directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock, who is the master of suspense. He is the only director I ever saw that I knew could make an audience just stop breathing for at least a minute or two, and be genuinely worried that something terrible was going to happen. Everyone knows Hitchcock's films, and everyone knows that they're good. But this one is one of the best.

I never saw the original
 In many ways, this movie is a perfect example of how Hollywood has lost its way. Rather than try to put out a great movie with a great script, they now seem to try to put out movies that are just original and interesting in their own way. This is a good movie, but it's not a good movie... It's a great movie. Even if it doesn't make sense and you have no idea who is talking, it's a great movie. The characters are complicated and interesting and so are the relationships between them. The performances are all good, I especially like Laura Dern as the mother and John Hawkes as the father. The story is sad and rewarding and I loved every minute of watching it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

*Please note that if you are going to see this movie, then you will want to see it in a theater. Although it is filmed well, the movie doesn't have the best sound track. It's not even the best sound track at the theater. You will have to choose your seats carefully to see the movie.

*I should also mention that this movie is the second one in a row that has a similar story line to "Adaptation
 I've had this movie for years and it is still one of my favorites. It's a good movie for the whole family. The music is great and it is easy to keep the kids watching. It is one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. I only wish it was in a widescreen format.

 I have always loved this movie. I think it is one of the best movies that have ever been made. It is sad and it is funny. It is about friendship. It is about sacrifice, and about the many things that can happen in life. It is about love. It is about pain, and about hope. It is about the good and the bad, and the ups and downs. It is about that feeling you get when you know something is going to work out. It is about the feeling you get when you know something is going to end up bad.

 I watched this movie at a theater with my friend Daniel, who is also a fan of horror movies. I enjoyed it, but I felt it was not scary enough (I was the only one in the theater that didn't scream or hide under the seat). I really enjoyed the movie, and I'm not a horror fan. Daniel said he thought it was a great movie, and he was totally scared by it. I really enjoyed the movie, but I think if I had watched it at home, I would have been scared. I think if you liked the first, you will like the second.

This movie was very scary, and I don't scare easy. The opening scene was my favorite. I'm not going to tell you why (it's a spoiler) but I think it was a good movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror, or even just horror movies. I also recommend the original, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I personally thought this movie was better then the first.

 It's been a long time since I've seen this film but it's a little gem and well worth the time to watch.<br /><br />I guess I was in my mid twenties when I first saw this film but it doesn't feel like a long time ago. The acting is superb and the story is a good one. I think it's worth watching as a film about life and how to deal with it. The music is just wonderful and the cinematography is very good. I would say that the film is a little slow but it's not too slow and it's well worth watching.

I don't think the film is totally realistic but it's more of a slice of life kind of film and the acting is spot on and it's a film that's well worth watching.

I think it's a film that should be watched by anyone who is thinking about their life, how to live it, how you can cope with it and how to deal with it.

I would recommend this film as a film that is just worth watching.

 This is not a bad film at all, in fact it is quite good - and it brings to people's attention a very important subject. I am a pacifist and I know enough about the subject to be able to see that this film is a good one. It shows what happens to those who do not accept violence as a means to peace, and it shows the horrors of war. It shows, in fact, the enormous gulf between the two philosophies. Violence is, after all, only a means to an end. It is an end in itself. Violence, in other words, is an end in itself. The film also clearly shows that power and aggression are the root causes of war, and that it is only by destroying these that peace can be achieved. I think this film is a very good one, and I am glad that it is being shown to the public.

The interpretation of the title of this film is somewhat misleading, since the film is more concerned with the differing points of view of two people than with two cultures. The two people in question are a Frenchman and an American, and the film is essentially a study of the two viewpoints. In fact, the name
 I saw this movie the other day, and I thought it was great. But I have to say that it is a very confronting movie, and it took me several times to get through it, as it does with most people. But it goes to show that these people were very brave, and that no story about them is complete without all the details.<br /><br />There are many controversial aspects of this film, which is why it is so well-loved by some, and hated by others. The film is about the Chinese in the Philippines during a time of war, and the Chinese had no rights, and were treated as less than human. The cruelty the Chinese endured is almost unbearable to watch, and the torture and murder scenes in the movie are very upsetting. Also, the movie shows how the Chinese were treated during the Japanese occupation, and the Japanese are shown to be brutal, and cruel, and selfish, and they showed no mercy to the Chinese. The Japanese were probably the most brutal people in Asia, and they could not be compared to the cruel Japanese soldiers in the film.<br /><br />So many people have a negative view of the Japanese, and this film is a very realistic portrayal of their cruelty,
 "Caddyshack II" is not just another sequel, it's a whole new movie, with an interesting premise and fresh situations. Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield are back as the caddyshacks and Rodney is still a buffoon. The plot takes place at the PGA tour event and we see all the caddyshacks who are there. It is a very good movie with a good premise. The original had been a good movie and this one is a very good movie, with lots of laughs and amazing situations. My favorite scene is the opening scene in the bar where Rodney is playing darts and Bill is playing pool. It is hilarious. There are many other good scenes, such as the scene where Rodney is talking to the minister and he is trying to be more religious. The other scenes are good too. This is a fun movie and I think that it is a must see. I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedies. I give it 9/10.

 The utterly unique, beautifully acted and directed, and quite moving film, only adds to the work of the creators of the festival, who in this case not only considered "auteur" but also "theatrical" in their approach. The Festival offers the chance to see the best of film, both from the "Big" studios or independent producers, and it should be mentioned that the festival does not allow for any kind of "pre-screening" for their guests, so the chance for audiences to stay and enjoy a film after it has already been shown to the public is minimal. In this case, it would have been nice to have kept the audience who came to see the film, as they could have stayed until the end and left with a better impression. It is a pity that the film was not given more exposure and recognition, as it deserved to be noticed, and it was in many ways a film that exceeded the British film scene, which is currently producing some very good work, such as the shorts at the Slamdance Festival, and their "Other People" section.

Martin Franks (Director) and Simon Notley (Writer) have created a film that transcends the normal limitations of our currently "standard
 I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. It was intense and scary as hell. The ending was hilarious, I mean, this guy gets killed in front of a crowd of people and they don't even care. How can anyone not be entertained by this? I went to see the sequel this weekend, but I found it to be very boring and uninteresting, the acting was horrible and the 3rd person camera shots were extremely annoying. The first movie was great, the sequels are not and I wouldn't recommend them at all.<br /><br />Oh, I should mention that I saw the first one in the theater and the second one at a crappy little theater in a mall.

The most terrifying horror film ever made.

 For a movie that only has a running time of 90 minutes, it sure did take me a while to get through it. As I said in the title, it's a slow burn. The first 75 minutes or so is definitely not a thriller, but a drama. The characters are quite well developed and played, as you would expect from a movie from the 80s. The story is relatively simple: a man, a former military man, is hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy family. The daughter is kidnapped, and the mother is frantically looking for her. With the help of a friend, the man gets to the bottom of the kidnapping and finds out that the girl is actually being held captive by her father. A lot of the story is told to us through flashbacks, but it works out very well in the end. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you like character driven movies with well developed backstory, you should give this a shot.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes slow burn dramas. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes character driven movies, especially if you're a fan of "The Silence of the Lambs".

 I have seen a lot of movies, I have played with a lot of computers, and I have been to a lot of movies. I think this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have read a lot of reviews on this movie on this website and everybody has been saying that the movie is good, but I say it is the best movie ever. I think that everybody should see this movie at least once in their lives. I think that anybody who has ever had the courage to go out and be different deserves to see this movie. It is a movie that everybody will always remember and talk about. I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone. This movie is one of the best movies ever, in my opinion. If you like movies like Lost, star wars, and any other kind of movies you will love this movie. If you like movies that have a lot of adventure in them you will love this movie. If you like movies that have a lot of twists and turns in them you will love this movie. If you like movies that have a lot of action in them you will love this movie. If you like movies with zombies, witches, and all that stuff you will love this movie. If you
 The first thing that came to mind was "Hollywood never made this one, it's good". In that regard, "Deliverance" is a very good film, one of the best made in terms of the skill of the actors, the cinematography, and the story. "Deliverance" is a story of a group of friends who go on a camping trip in the Georgia woods, and the horrific events that occur during that trip. The story is based on a novel by the same name, written by James Dickey, who also wrote the screenplay for "Deliverance". There are only a few differences between the novel and the film, and the only real difference is that the photography isn't in color, it's in black and white. "Deliverance" was truly a film that came out at the right time, because it was a film about the environment and its effects on man, something that was very real and important to Americans at the time, and still is. The cast includes John Boorman, Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, Jonny Lee Miller, and Ronny Cox, who were all at the top of their game. "Deliverance" is a great film
 This is a very well written, beautifully filmed and brilliant acted film about the plight of the thousands of disabled people who were left behind in the care of the Nazis. It is a warning about the perils of giving power to a small, but fanatic group of people. It is an excellent example of how the Nazi regime used propaganda to shift the blame for their atrocities upon the Jews and Communists and make the rest believe they were being persecuted. It is a warning to those who would make a similar mistake today.

The film is set in the town of Roushie and centres on the story of one boy, Liev Schreiber, who is given a new kidney by a young doctor, and the effects of this on the life of his parents. It is a moving story of the love and devotion of parents for their children and the power of that love to bring them through the worst tragedies.

The film is based on a play and this is what makes it so good. The film loses nothing from this. It is a very moving story and one which I found very moving even though I knew the outcome. I am a father and I was brought up in a family which was very much like that of the Schre
 Today the film seems almost like a relic of the Cold War. I wonder if that is all part of the charm of the film. Maybe, I am just a sucker for stories of the Cold War. This movie has a real old time feel to it. Even though it is shot in the modern day, it manages to capture the feel of a spy movie that was made decades ago. I think Roger Moore really looks the part of a spy. I was particularly fond of the song that he sang at the end of the film. It was a good way to wrap up the film. I liked the way the story ended. The film has a lot of great one liners. My favorite was the one about the Russians not knowing the difference between a game of chess and checkers. I think it was funny that the Russians were using the wrong pieces in the game of chess. They were using checkers instead of pawns. I thought the film was different in some ways. It has a lot of action and a lot of spy talk. I think it is a pretty entertaining film. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the spy genre. I am a fan of the genre and I thought this was a pretty good film
 I'm so glad I finally saw this movie, it was great! The plot was well written, the characters were well developed and the plot was a very good pace. The story was believable and the characters were very well developed. i enjoyed it very much, and i couldn't stop smiling. A must see for all, i can't wait for the DVD.

 The acting, especially by Mrs. Wilson (Roxanna Wilson, who died soon after the film's release) and the supporting cast, was very good. And the story, while predictable, was beautifully told. Sad, but beautiful. As was the music. I wish I remembered the title, but I still remember the songs. If you liked "The Song of Bernadette" or "The Thorn Birds," you'll like this movie.

 I watched this movie last night, and I loved it! I had to watch the whole thing. I wasn't sure how I would like the story line, but it was so good, I couldn't stop watching. I was impressed with the acting, the script, the direction, everything. I watched it again this morning before work, and could not stop thinking about it. This is a movie I will watch over and over again, and I know I will want to watch it with my children. This is definitely a movie I will watch with my family, but it is also a movie that I would watch with a date on a night in. I loved it!

The movie was very entertaining, but also very scary at the same time. It was great.

I will definitely watch this movie again.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

There are many scary movies out there, but this is one that I think is great.

I give this movie a 10/10.

 I was on the edge of my seat for the first half hour of this movie. It was exciting and the acting was good. It was a little slow in the middle, but that was the only part I felt was a little too long. I liked the ending, but I think it could have ended a little differently. The directing was good, but it was hard to tell when some of the scenes were shot. Some of the scenes were hard to understand, but I think that's because there was no sound. The movie would have been a lot better if there had been sound. I think this movie was definitely worth watching.

 I really like this movie. The story is fantastic. The effects are good. The acting is great. The message is great. The only thing I feel is lacking is the humor. They could have put more humor in the movie. But this is a blockbuster. I think it's a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone.

 This is the best movie ever made. This is a movie about the human spirit. It has everything that makes a good film. It's action packed, it's funny, it's scary, it's serious. It's an all around great film. And it's got some of the best music I've ever heard. The film is a heartbreaker, and a great way to spend a good summer evening. I love it and I will always love it. And I will always love the soundtrack.

I'm a big fan of the original Friday the 13th. The sequel, Jason Lives, is a horrible film. The only good thing about that movie is the music. This film is garbage. I haven't seen Jason Goes to Hell yet, but it looks promising.

Great soundtrack, probably one of the best soundtracks ever made. I'm a big fan of the original Friday the 13th and this soundtrack is a lot better than the sequel. I love the music, it's very original and cool. I love the songs they used. The movie is just as
 If you like the sit-com, you'll like this movie. It's just as good, if not better. The plot is very similar to the sit-com. The show's plot is the same as the movie, and the situation is very similar. <br /><br />The most important thing to remember is that this movie is about the friendship between two friends, and their love for each other. Just like the sit-com, the movie shows that these two are soulmates. The plot is very similar, because in both, the two guys fall in love with the same girl. And in both movies they fall in love with the same girl. <br /><br />These two movies are very similar, but there are some differences. The plot is very similar in both, but the movie shows different sides of the story. In the sit-com, people act as if they don't really like each other, but in the movie, they show that they really do like each other. In the sit-com, the two guys are shown to be very rude, but in the movie, they are shown to be very friendly and respectful to each other. In the sit-com, the two guys are shown
 This movie is a film which could have been made a hundred years ago, but it is still refreshing, funny and brilliant. I am not a fan of Wilde, but I do understand why. This movie was made around the time Wilde came to Britain, and some critics were not fair to him. He was not a great writer, but he was a great actor, who had a wonderful sense of humor and a brilliant gift for parody. The best thing about this movie is that it is so funny. The jokes are funny, the acting is brilliant and the sets are beautiful. The acting is very good in this movie. I loved the way the actor played the piano. It was the best acting I have ever seen in a movie. I do not know much about Wilde, but I do know that he was guilty of a lot of things. I do not like him, but I do understand that he was a great actor. This movie is a great example of his acting. I think that this movie is a film which should be seen by everyone. It is a perfect example of what Wilde could do. I can't imagine a better acting job. I love this movie. I love the sets, the acting, the humor and the fact
 I've seen this movie twice now and have been looking for it for years. I got it for my birthday, and I'm very happy with it!<br /><br />The movie is hilarious! I love the way the characters interact, and the adventure that the kids go through. It's a family movie, but it's not boring like some of the Disney movies I've seen. :)<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth the rent. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves adventure and laughs.

A fantastic movie for the whole family. It's funny, exciting, and really well made. I really love the way the movie is put together. The characters are fun and easy to relate to. The story line is great. I really like the way the movie was put together. The acting is great and the story is very interesting. This is a great movie for all ages. I would recommend this movie to anyone
 I really like this movie. It's not a typical romantic comedy, but it's still good. It's about a guy and a girl who, through no choice of their own, become very close friends. And, of course, it's about the difficulties of having a relationship between two people who are so very different. It's about the hardships and joys of friendship, and how two people can be better off when they're not trying to be each other's lover, but just being there for each other. The acting is very good, and the chemistry between the two stars is evident. I hope that this is the first of many of Janeane Garofalo's films that I can look forward to.

 I saw this movie recently, and I have to say that it is just great. The acting is very good and there are some nice surprises. The only thing is that the movie is a bit short, and it might have been better if it was longer. But all in all, if you like comedy, this movie is a must-see.

In this comedy, a guy named John Nash (played by the hilarious David Cross) has a nervous breakdown and leaves his wife (played by the adorable Maria Bello) to start a new life in a new town. He ends up in a small town in New Mexico, where he meets up with a young police officer named Ben (played by the adorable Paul Rudd). Together, they try to find a way to start a new life in a new town, and along the way they meet up with many interesting characters that make their new life in their new town even more interesting.I really enjoyed this movie. It is definitely one of the best comedies that I have ever seen. The acting is excellent, the story is interesting and funny, and the characters are all
 This is a very entertaining Christmas movie. It has a lot of action, suspense and humor. I especially like the way they made the wierd guy look different and how they made the Santa Claus look very funny. I also like how they made the bad guy look like a very bad guy. This is a very good Christmas movie to watch. I give it a 8. It is a very good movie.

 I thought this movie was pretty good. I love the genre of horror, and this was a real good one. It wasn't the best, but it was pretty good. I didn't think I would like this movie, but I did. It was not as gory as most horror movies, but it was pretty good. I didn't think it would be this interesting but it was. I thought it was a great movie. It was not scary, but it was entertaining. I would recommend this movie. I thought it was pretty good. I would watch it again sometime. I think it was well done. It wasn't scary, but it was entertaining. It was well done.

 I am a huge fan of the original film and I am definitely not a fan of the remake of the film, but I love this version of the story and I think it is an excellent movie. The special effects are amazing, the acting is great, and the story is just as good as the original. I think the great thing about this version of the film is that it does not try to retell the story, it just tells the story of the original. I think it is a great movie for any horror fan to see.

Gabby - The Musical
 The first time I saw this film I was a kid and it scared me. I couldn't get past the first few minutes. This was before I knew what a great film was. Now I know that it is a classic and I still watch it occasionally. I understand that this film is not for everyone. I know that a lot of people are turned off by the fact that the horror aspect of the film is not the main focus. I know that a lot of people are turned off by the fact that this is a remake of a Japanese film. But I still enjoy it mainly because of the suspense and the setting. I also like the fact that this film is not your typical slasher film (although it does have a few killings). It is a quiet film that is more about the characters and the setting. I'd like to say that this film is a masterpiece, but it is not. It is still a great film that I think should be seen by everyone. It is a very emotional film, but in a good way. I like the fact the main character, Chris, does not have a story arc. He is a very smart person and does not fall for the trap that all the other characters fall for. I like the
 I was lucky enough to see this film in the cinema when it opened on the 1st of December 1979, just as I was leaving school and beginning work. I saw it for the first time in my life on the opening night, and was very disappointed to see it was only a 13 minute short. I think I've seen it about 5 or 6 times since then, and each time I'm still impressed with it. The story is the most amazing I've ever seen, and the acting is superb. I remember being very impressed with the way the film ended and was surprised to see the film was still not over. With hindsight I'm not sure it needed to be so long, but I don't think you could make this film any shorter without it being a total failure. I think it's a stunning short film, and one that everybody should see.

A superb short film that's deserving of the Oscar it received.

 I've been watching Kung Fu since it started in the early 1970's. I've seen it come and go a few times but have never been able to get my hands on a copy of the original. I'm glad I finally have it. The first season is an incredible roller coaster ride from beginning to end. The fighting is exciting, the story is well written and the acting is incredible. The second season was a bit disappointing in some ways, but the story and the acting still hold up. This is a must have for any fan of kung fu.

Amatulli - Published on Amazon.com Format: DVD Kung fu is one of the most famous and influential TV series of all time. I remember seeing it when I was in the first grade and was blown away by it. Even though the series was canceled after only two seasons, I still remember the first two seasons and the stories were still good. This collection of the first two seasons of the series is just as good as I remember. I love the way that the characters are
 When talking about the "best of" series, it is always hard to settle on just one. There are so many great ones, and there is no doubt that some of them are much better than others. In terms of quality, I would have to say that the original series is the best of the bunch. The first two seasons are especially good, but I would put the second season next to the original series. The later seasons, from what I have seen, aren't as good as the earlier seasons. Also, the original series had some pretty good characters, but the series that followed was just too over-the-top for me. I think the original series was a little too realistic in some of the things that went on, but the later series was just too ridiculous. I'm not saying that they were bad, they just weren't as good. I have to say that the only current series I really like is the one that came out recently, "The Loop". I know that this show is more aimed at kids, but I really like it. There is a lot of action, and there are some interesting characters. I also enjoy the fact that the show is not run by a bunch of old men. It's not
 The best science fiction film I've seen in a long time. The idea of taking a computer program/simulation to be the other half of a human (apparently the only way to get into the future) is good, but the acting and everything else is what makes it worth watching.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the acting - it's the best acting I've seen since Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. The actors actually seem to care about their characters. The female lead and the transgendered male lead, both of whom are almost unrecognizable from their previous roles and seem to be doing this for the first time, and even the stereotypical geek/nerd (in a good way) gets a chance to shine. The acting even makes the robots seem believable. I thought the scene where the main character is explaining the machine to the geek at the start of the film was going to be a bit cheesy, but it's actually quite moving.<br /><br />The only small complaint I have is that the film is a little too close to reality at times. It's not a bad thing, but it's a little too close to home sometimes. That is, it feels like it
 I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was exceptionally good, and the story was gripping. The acting originated from the entire cast, especially from the main cast. I was impressed by the acting which was realistic and believable. The acting was a big plus for me. Another plus for me was the suspense. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Another plus for me was that the movie had a little bit of comedy in it. It wasn't overly comedy, but it was there.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the movie, there were some things that I didn't like. First, the movie had a few technical issues. I found that the movie's sound was not very good. Although the movie was filmed properly, the sound was not. The camera work was extremely good, but the sound was the only thing that was bad. That's why I rated the movie a 9. Another thing that I didn't like was the ending. The ending was extremely rushed. It was pretty much a cliffhanger. It was extremely bad. As much as I didn't like the ending, I loved the rest of the movie. The rest of the movie was beautiful. Although the ending was bad, the
 A relationship with a ghost makes for a very interesting story and one that is handled with great skill by director John Huston. It is easy to see why this film won two Academy Awards in 1951, one for best original screenplay, the other for best supporting actor, the late Walter Huston. The ghost, played by Peter Lorre, is the only character in the film, but he is so real that he is able to have a relationship with the human characters. The quality of the performances from the entire cast is excellent but I especially liked the work of three of the actors in this film, especially Edmond O'Brien and Michael O'Shea. The film was also nominated for best picture, but lost to "The Greatest Show on Earth." The film is also very well made, in part because of the fact that it was shot in Mexico and in part because of the great work done on the sets.

The film is a very interesting tale of a man who is haunted by a ghost, not a supernatural force, but a real person that he is haunted by. It is the story of a man who, by his own choice, has been condemned to live in the shadow of the past. A man who is so

 "The Golden Compass" is an adapted by Chris Weitz of the books by Philip Pullman. The film was directed by the same man who directed the "Twilight" film series. Pullman is best known for his trilogy of books, starting from "The Golden Compass." This film is a fantasy/adventure film and is a sci-fi film. This film is a faithful adaptation of the book with an exception of one character. This is a family film and a fantasy film which is perfect for the entire family to enjoy. I recommend this film for anyone who love fantasy and adventure.

*A note to those who have read the book, the movie does not follow the book. It is a creative movie that is an adventure worth seeing.

The Golden Compass is a solid movie that makes it's way onto the big screen. It is a good family film and has a great soundtrack to go along with it. I am a huge fan of the book and I was very pleased with the movie. This movie is a must see with great special effects and a great adventure.

 I just saw this movie a month ago and loved it. It uses the premise of the movie very well and makes it a bit more personal. The script is pretty good, but the acting is what really makes the movie. Jennifer Aniston is perfect in this role and her performance alone makes this movie worth seeing. The supporting cast is also excellent and each person has a great role in the movie. Overall, it is a great movie and is well worth seeing.

 Man, I loved this movie. It is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and not get tired of. It has a great cast and a wonderful script that is so original and fresh. I loved the way they used the camera angles and the shots to tell us what was going on. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and I have always loved it more each time I see it. I also love all the characters and the way they were written into the story. I loved all the little details that are put into this movie. It is something that I am sure just about everyone can relate to in some way, shape or form. It is a great movie about guys who are full of themselves and are moving on to the next thing and trying to find the meaning to their lives. The key for me is that it is about the journey and not the destination. This is a great movie and a must see.

 This movie is quite possibly the best movie ever, if not the best. The acting is amazing, and the script is brilliant. The acting is done so well that you almost believe that you are actually watching real people. The movie is not only an amazing tale of a boy, but it also shows the harsh reality of life, and the dark side of the human mind. The dark side is shown well in this movie, and it leaves a lasting impression. This movie is not for the faint of heart, or for those who do not like to see harsh reality, or for those who do not like to see the dark side of life. This is a movie for those who want to know exactly how people really are, and how life really is. This movie is the best movie of all time, and it should be given 100 stars.

 This movie is so good that I can't believe it. The acting is awful, there are so many plot holes that it is easy to see why this movie is so bad. The only way I can explain this movie is that they were so desperate to make money they thought they could make up a story and sell it as a movie. The movie is so bad that I can't help but laugh at it. The only reason I gave it a 7 out of 10 is because it is so bad that it is funny. This movie is so bad that I would only watch it if someone else made me watch it by watching it. I would definitely not spend money on this movie.

 As a student of Shakespeare, I found this film to be an excellent teaching tool. The actors were all excellent, the staging was superb, and the music was superb. I wish there were more films like this one.

Summit Entertainment, and I thank them for such a great movie, and for it's success.

I saw the movie, at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, and it was a really great movie. The theater staff were great, and the food was delicious.

Thank you, Summit Entertainment and the Alamo Drafthouse, for the great experience. I hope to see more films like this one.

This is a great film, with a great story, and a great message. I love that the movie is about Shakespeare, but it is about the audience, and the people watching the film, and the meaning and message of the play. The message is clear: be yourself, live your life, and enjoy it, because it's the only life you will ever get.

Great film, and great theater.

 I didn't quite get the whole Dutch angle in this movie, but it was still a fun watch. It's nice to see some European humor in a movie, even if it's only a small part of the story. The fishnet-clad LaMorte is a hoot, and the overall story is good, too.

The only thing that really bothered me was the "flaming" of the Dutch sailors - they were clearly soaked before they stepped in the water, and then burnt after they got out. It was easy to tell from their skin color, but I found it sort of cruel when I saw it in the movie.

Overall, though, it was a good story, and I think people who are used to seeing the stars being drowned will enjoy this one.

 The film looks great but is a bit slow and lacks a plot. However, it is certainly one of the most interesting films you will ever see. It is about a woman who is hypnotized to forget about her real life, only to wake up in the middle of a white room. She is forced to live her life through someone else's eyes. A hypnotist puts her under and she is unable to tell anyone about what she is experiencing. Her character is forced to live in a basement with a group of people she does not know. She is not allowed to talk or write anything down. She has to tell them what she sees, what she hears, and what she feels.<br /><br />This film is very interesting because we don't really know what is going on. We watch the film and we find out the story through the people in the basement. They tell each other what is going on by word of mouth. They are not allowed to write anything down, so they are forced to talk. The film is really interesting because we are not allowed to go outside the film and know what is really happening.<br /><br />I would rate this film a 10 out of 10. It is a very interesting film to
 I have to admit, I was not expecting much from this film. It was only a matter of time before they filmed it and I am glad they did. It was a great Christmas present to myself. The story line was good and the acting was superb. I just wish I had been in the right place at the right time to enjoy the film. I guess I am a bit of a Lothario because I have been to Florence, Italy and seen the location where the film was made. I was there in the late 70's. I was in a bar and the bartender, who was a friend of mine, was playing a violin. I was stunned. I asked him what he was playing and he said the soundtrack to "Last Tango In Paris." I was blown away. I had never heard of the film or the violinist but I told him that it was the greatest thing I had ever heard. I think the film is a bit of a romantic comedy but also a bit of a thriller about a man that does not know how to trust women and a woman who does not know how to trust men.<br /><br />The film is rated R for language and some sexual situations.

 I have been a fan of this series since it began. I am a college student and have watched the series religiously. My friends and I have had many great discussions about it. This series is just a fun way to spend time with friends and at the same time be entertained. It is a great way to learn about true history and the amazing things that men have done. It is a great way to learn about the World War II era, and the incredible bravery that people had during the war. It really shows the things that went on behind the scenes of the war and how ordinary people were affected by the events of the war. It is not just a fun series to watch, it is also very educational and will help you to learn about the events of the war in a different way.

I would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in history, especially the history of World War II. It is definitely a must-watch.

I give this series 9 out of 10.

This series is a must-watch. It has helped me to understand World War II in a whole new way.

This series is a must-watch with friends and family, it is entertaining and fun.

 This movie is simply wonderful! I was raised in the West of Ireland and have a very vivid and personal connection to this film. I only hope that many people, especially the young people, will be moved by this film and will go out and make their own film! This is a very inspiring movie. Those with Irish connections will relate to it. Those who are not Irish will connect with it. It is a wonderful example of a movie that transcends the limits of time, place and culture. Thankyou, Saoirse Ronan, for such a wonderful performance, and I hope that you will be rewarded for such a wonderful movie.

A wonderful movie about friendship and love. I cried at the end and I loved it.

This is a beautiful story of a small town girl and a big city boy who fall in love and decide to make a film that reflects the friendship they share. The relationship between Saoirse and Cillian is truly wonderful. They both have a very special quality that they share. They support each other and inspire each other. The choice of music is perfect as well. I loved the movie, it made
 I love this movie. I was actually looking for it online when I came across it on Amazon.<br /><br />I've seen it several times, but I think it's still new and fresh each time. I've watched it with several different people now, and all of us have found something new to pick on each time. <br /><br />If you haven't seen it, it's worth checking out.

A real gem - highly recommended

Author: ronw from United Kingdom

25 February 2013



I've seen this a few times and each time it's more and more enjoyable, it's so difficult to find something that is new and inventive, yet also appeals to the masses, but this film does! It's one of the best if not the best film of all time, up there with the best of Hitchcock and the best of Wes Anderson. It's not for everyone, but I have to say I have a really great time watching it. It's the kind of film that you have to be in the right mood for, which is why I always discover
 This movie is about a man who is on a mission to rid the world of the disease that is eating him away. He is being driven by an inner feeling of guilt and he is really trying to expel that from his life. He takes the virus from one victim to another and then dies. The only thing that can stop him is the beautiful woman he loves, a woman who fights him at every turn. He does not want to harm her. In the end he does not have a choice and must kill her. I enjoyed this movie very much. The acting was very good. I especially liked the way that the character played by Richard Gere was written. At times it was hard to tell if he was really sick or just pretending to be so that he could get close to the woman he loved. He is a good actor and he did a good job with this role. I also liked the way that the movie was written. It was very artistic and creative. I especially enjoyed the way that it was shot. It looked very artistic and artistic. The cinematography was very well done. I also enjoyed the way that the movie was shot. It was very artistic and artistic. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who like either artistic

 I saw this film in its original theatrical release in the late 1970s. I was a kid, and I thrilled to the movie. I still am thrilled to it. It's a wonderful example of how a movie can be made well without having to be expensive.<br /><br />The movie is well-written, directed and acted. It's a very original movie that is still fresh and vibrant almost forty years after its release.<br /><br />There are three stories in the movie. One is the story of a young boy named Doug (Dax Shepard) whose father is the town's mayor. His father is a man who believes that the town will be better off with him at the head of it. But Doug doesn't agree with that, and he's very vocal about it. There's a town meeting where he's going to be able to put his views on the board, and he's expecting a measure of support from the other townsfolk. But he's surprised to find out that he's the only one who disagrees.<br /><br />The second story is that of a young girl named Sarah (Lori Singer). She lives in the town, and she's in love with the town's best baseball
 This is a film about a girl who has to go to stay at her father's farm, where she meets a boy. She's pretty, wild and very mischievous. At first she doesn't want to stay but then she changes her mind. This film is about life and how it's so different for everyone. I loved this film and all of the actors do a great job in it. It's a very funny film, you'll probably laugh a lot, and it's a very good film to watch if you have a lot of free time. I hope you'll like it too, and let me know what you think of it!

She meets a boy who is also at the farm and he has a bit of a reputation, but he's really nice. Alice finds out that she's really different from all the other people in the farm. She doesn't want to make friends with anyone and she never goes anywhere, but then she
 I was surprised by this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not your typical, big budget, special effects filled Hollywood fantasy movie. This movie tells a classic story of a mystical cave man and his family, who are the last of their kind. The story is simple and what you expect from a caveman story, but the end result is a movie that entertains and shows a lot of courage and strength for the actors to make this movie. I was not expecting it but, it was definitely a good movie.

I liked the movie but only because of the acting. The actors were good in this movie, and that made the movie enjoyable. This is the type of movie that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good movie to watch. Looking forward to watching the sequel.

 When I first saw this movie I wasn't sure what I should rate it, but after having watched it many times and having seen it in the theater I have decided to give it a 9. The movie is excellent. I chose this movie as it was one of the few that had the word "chicken" in the title. I was surprised at how well this movie was done. I liked the movie and the story very much. I especially liked the ending. Good movie, but with a few flaws. I see that this movie has been rated 9.9 out of 10. I think that some people rated this movie so high because of the rating system. I feel that this movie deserves to be rated 9.9 out of 10, but I see how it is rated 9.9. I wonder how many people have seen this movie and how many people rated this movie so high based on the rating system. I have rated this movie 9.9 because of the good acting and story. I also feel that this movie is a good movie because of the suspense, action, and likable characters. I think that this movie is good because of the acting, the setting, and the story.

I would recommend this movie to
 This is the second "Terminator", I saw the first one in the theater and it was great. This one is even better. Arnold is even better and the suspense is even more intense. The effects are very good and the action is terrific. I like the way they made the T-1000 into a robot. I don't know what they used but it is good. It's a must see. The story is great and the ending is good. I like the new T-800. I am looking forward to the second one. This is a great movie.

*This is a sequel to the film "The Terminator"

Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is a masterpiece. It is a very difficult movie to watch but it is well worth the effort. The movie is about the battle of Guadalcanal during World War II and it is shot in a very artistic manner. The film is about the men who were at the front and about their lives. This is a very good film to see.

 I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. Based on the reviews I read, I was expecting a fairly average crime/thriller. Instead, I found a movie that was quite entertaining and quite funny. While it is not quite up to the standards of the Coen brothers or Quentin Tarentino, it is still a pretty good movie. It has some good performances, and a good story. If it wasn't for this movie, I probably would have never even heard of the name Joe Pesci. It was a lot of fun to watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, fun movie.

 A very good movie by a very good director. It is a very interesting story of a man who is wrongfully convicted of a crime and tries to convince the jury that the real criminal is the judge.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie and you like movies of this genre, I strongly recommend it.

Stunningly Disciplined

Author: julieb-331 from United States

30 October 2003



How many movies can you say that you have seen that are as shockingly disciplined as this movie? I have seen so many movies that are very good, but just not very well directed (and this goes for all directors, not just those that aren't household names). I think you have to be a good director to make a movie that is disciplined in the way that this one is. I have seen so many movies that are just very nice in every way, and don't really have much to offer in terms of being a "good" movie. This one is different. It has a good story, it has a good performance, it has a good script
 I loved the movie. It was funny, it had a great cast, and it was great to see the movie go from being a box office bomb to a big hit. I am surprised that no one else has mentioned that the movie has a great message about how it is important for people to get to know each other. This is a great message for all ages, including teenagers. This movie is a must see for all ages.

I read somewhere that the producers thought that the movie would be a hit, but no one would want to see it. I think they were wrong. I agree with some of the other comments in that the movie was a bit childish, but it was still a very good movie.

I hope that this movie continues to do well and that it can put Disney back on the map.

PS. I agree with the other comments on how odd the movie was. I was wondering why the people were on ice and then I realized that this movie was strange in that it was not very linear.

PPS. I also liked how the movie was not necessarily a love story, but a story about friendship and
 The second and final film in John Boorman's trilogy of pirate movies. This time the focus is on a terrifying villain, Captain Stede Bonnet, played with all the swagger and panache by Albert Finney.<br /><br />Bonnet is also the villain in The Buccaneers, and is seen briefly at the end of that film, and in a later scene in The Revenge, but never in all these films. This time he dominates the picture, and he is truly a terrifying pirate. Even more so than in The Buccaneers, Bonnet is a real monster and all too believable as a vicious and dangerous enemy.<br /><br />It's hard to say which of the two films is the best. The Revenge is rather dark and moody, and this film is filled with action. The Revenge is also more subjective and a bit more about the story and the characters, whereas The Buccaneers has a more objective view of the pirates and their methods. Both are great movies though.<br /><br />The Revenge is also an improvement on its predecessor, which I thought was one of the best pirate movies ever made. The Revenge is a lot more about the action and the story, and is also a lot more realistic,
 I was a little disappointed in this film. While it was a decent film, with good acting and production values, I was hoping for more. The film didn't really have a purpose. It wasn't a story about a man's life; it was more of a collection of things that happened to him. I liked the characters, and the actors did a good job, but I wish there was more to work with. I also felt that the film was lacking in an emotional connection. The story was fine, but I didn't really feel anything for the characters. I think this is more of a film for people who are interested in the subject matter, or who are interested in the acting, rather than people who are emotionally involved with the characters. I think this is the main reason the film didn't work as well as I hoped it would.

I did like the film, and thought it was well done, but I was expecting more.

 This movie is great. It's a dark comedy that reminds me of "River's Edge" and "The Last Seduction" (all those Jean Seberg films). It's not particularly gory, but it gets the job done. The characters are well-developed and I was very invested in their outcomes. The only problem with this film is that it's not particularly fun to watch. The characters are so very human and the movie is so very realistic that it makes you feel like you're right there with them. The movie is a bit slow to begin, but once the characters are revealed (and we see the "real" people in the movie), the film picks up speed. The ending is a bit of a downer (I won't spoil it) but it's still a worthwhile film. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing a dark comedy.

 This is a good movie. No, it's one of the best I've seen in years. If you're looking for a pure popcorn film, look elsewhere. This movie is more like a finely crafted puzzle. It's story is told in a few different ways, each of which is as well executed as the other. It's a little slow at first, but once you get it all figured out, it makes perfect sense. The acting by the three main characters is great. The casting of the rest of the cast is also spot on. I think the only thing that really bothered me a bit was some of the dialog. For example, during the whole "you're a cold-hearted bastard" part of the movie, the dialog was a little wooden. Also, the dialog of the guy who is trying to sleep with his wife was a bit too modern for the time period. Overall, though, the movie is a great effort and is definitely worth watching.

 To watch this is to watch a very well made film. I was very impressed by the script, which deals with a very important issue in our society. The question of why we treat our children so badly. We treat our children as if they are commodities. We beat them, abuse them, and most of all we fail to see them as human beings. The fact that this film is about a child who has been abused is also very disturbing. As a parent myself I can't really see how or why we would treat our children the way we do. I have seen many films that deal with the issue of child abuse, but I have never seen one with such a good script. The film has a lot of heart, and I think it would make a great movie to watch with the kids in the family. I believe it would also be a great movie to introduce children to the issue of child abuse.

As far as the acting, I was very impressed by the work of both actors. Emily Watson is excellent as the mother, who has suffered a lot of abuse in her life. I don't know how she managed to play such a character so well, but she did. It was also great to see John Lynch. As
 This is a wonderful movie. I'm a big fan of the animated Winnie the Pooh series and I do wish they would've made a "live action" version of the series. This movie is a very good example of what a live action Winnie the Pooh movie should be like. The characters are all very good and the story is also a good one. If you're a fan of Winnie the Pooh this is a must see!

***SPOILER***

When Pooh and his friends go to see the movie "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree" they're so happy to finally see a movie that they don't notice that it's a sequel. They're happy that they can see a "movie" they love but they've never even seen the original Winnie the Pooh movie. I think that's why Christopher Robin is so disappointed that they didn't know the original Winnie the Pooh movie. I think that's a great thing that they did in the movie.

Everybody in the theater was laughing, and all the men were reaching over to their wives and whispering in their ears "Did you see that?" It is impossible to figure out all the twists and turns of this movie. At the end, when you think you've got it all figured out, the movie throws another curve ball. You won't be disappointed.
 This is a very interesting movie. It tells the story of a man named John Malkovich. He is a very successful actor and a very talented director. He is also very attractive to women. His wife, Michelle, is the love of his life. She is also a very successful actress. They have a son named Tom. Tom's father comes to visit them.

 I've watched this movie many times. It's one of those movies that I think is one of the most underrated movies of the past decade. The last time I saw it was a decade ago and it was just as good as I remembered. The story is about a young couple, (Robbie) and (Carrie) who lives in a small town. They used to be good friends but then Robbie got married and so did Carrie's friend. Robbie's father is a preacher and he is always willing to help the poor, and so he does when Carrie's friend comes to him for help. They have a son and he is sick and the doctor doesn't know what to do for him. Then the preacher finds out that Robbie has a son who is sick and he knows how to cure him. The preacher takes the child to a medicine man, who knows how to cure him, but he needs a special herb which only grows in the mountains. Robbie and Carrie go to the mountains to get the herb but they don't find it, but they do pick up a young Indian girl. She is not always nice to the couple and Robbie thinks that she is a witch but Carrie says that she is not. The couple and the Indian girl
 This movie is so bad it's good. It's bad in the sense that it's an '80's movie that takes itself seriously, which is bad in and of itself. It's bad in that it's a horror movie that doesn't scare anybody. And it's bad in that it's a comedy with some horror elements. <br /><br />In short, it's the kind of movie you wouldn't mind re-watching if you had the time.<br /><br />The story is about two British brothers, one of whom is a complete tool, who go to a house to finally get rid of the crazy old lady who lives in it. They plan to get rid of her by having her put out of her misery, but once there, she escapes, kills both of them, and then turns into a monster. <br /><br />While the premise is highly implausible and the movie is not at all scary, it's one of those movies that's good for a few chuckles, and fun to watch with a few friends. <br /><br />The movie is played for laughs, which makes it all the more entertaining. The characters are all pretty good, even the 'villain',

 I was surprised to see that it was a Danish movie, and was even more surprised that it was a children's movie. I was expecting a movie about a little boy and a little girl, who like to play together. But this movie is not about a little boy and a little girl. It is about a little boy and a little girl, who like to play together. And they play together all the time. But the little girl is a baby, so they don't play with her, and the little boy is the baby's father. The little boy and the little girl are a little baby. They are so little. They can't even crawl. They can't even walk. They can't even talk. They can't even eat. They can't even play.

But the little boy can. He can play with the little girl, and she will play with him. He can play with her, so that she will play with him. And he does play with her, and she will play with him. And the little boy and the little girl live in a house with a big garden. And in the garden there is a little farm. And in the farm there is a little cow. And in the cow there
 This is a brilliant film that takes an old genre, the Western, and makes it fresh and exciting again. The opening sequence is somewhat reminiscent of the "Pulp Fiction" opening. The first of many surprises is that there are no murders or gunfights in this movie. The cast and the story itself is so absorbing that you really don't notice the absence of violence. This is a great film that is so good that it may be the best film of the year. It was based on a book by Michael Connelly, the author of "The Poet". The film is filled with action and tension but is also filled with great performances and characters that are amazingly authentic. The story is about a man (played by Sean Penn) who is accused of a murder, who is given a chance to prove his innocence by going on a journey to find the real killer. The cast is filled with very good actors including, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson, and Chris Cooper. The movie is filled with suspense and action, and is a very good movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat.

 As someone who was born in Toronto, I found this to be a great documentary to watch. It's well paced, and the actors and actresses they used in the film were brilliant. It's got a great soundtrack, and it's nice to have a sample of Canadian culture in my collection. The DVD features some behind the scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew, as well as some extras.

<br /><br />Personally, I found the documentary to be very accurate in terms of representation of the different 'types' of Toronto (I was born and bred in the west end). I love how you can see the differences in the different areas of the city, and I think the documentary does this very well. The documentary is shot well and the music is great.

<br /><br />All in all, it's a great documentary that captures the essence of the city which I love.

<br /><br />As for the actors and actresses, I especially loved Nicole de Boer as the sweet little girl who loves making her father's coffee. I also loved the actors and actresses who played the street people, and who also played the young boy (the one who was like, "
 This was a really cool movie. There are a few things that I can think of that the movie could have used to make it better. First, it would have been cool to see the under-water part of the Titanic. Then, one of the scenes takes place in a restaurant, and the camera would have been nice to have moved around that area a bit so it could have shown us the inside of the restaurant. And finally, if the Titanic was sinking, I think that there would have been a better way to show it. But in the end, the movie is great, and it's about the best one that I've seen.

8/10

***SPOILER*** My favorite part of the movie is when the Titanic finally goes under the water, and then the little boy on the screen says, "I'm not scared." That's the sweetest part of the movie, because it reminds me of how I felt when I was a little kid, and I was scared of something.

10/10

***END SPOILER*** I thought the movie was good, and it helped me remember how much I loved Titanic.

 This is a great little horror film. I had watched it on TCM years ago and have just recently found it. It is a simple story, but it is done so well. The sets are fantastic, the actors are good, and the filming is very good. A while back I read that the actress, who plays the lead role, was at one time married to Vincent Price. This is true, but it seems to have been forgotten by many.

The plot is simple: A young woman is sent by her dad to her grandfather's house out in the country to work on the farm while he is away. She meets the quirky spinster aunt and grandfather. They seem to be a pretty nice bunch. But all is not as it appears. The plot is actually quite interesting and it is easy to follow.

After watching this, I am now a huge fan of the late, great, Vincent Price. I have seen all of his films except for his early silent films. I am really looking forward to seeing those.

This is a great little horror film. If you love Vincent Price, you will enjoy this.

 "Ed Wood" (which I admit I have only seen once) is a movie about a guy who didn't know how to make movies so he tried to make one and he tried to tell people how to make movies. It's a pretty funny movie that made me laugh so hard I cried. It also made me realize how much I love movies. The movie is pretty funny but the real reason why I love it is because it's a movie about a guy who loves movies and tries to make movies and tells people how to make movies and at the end of the movie he dies. I love movies so much that it might make me cry to see this movie because it reminds me of how much I love movies. I don't think I'm the only person who loves movies because I know I'm not because I've seen this movie and I know so many people who love movies too. I think it's funny because it reminds me of my own life because I love movies and I'm trying to make them and I'm trying to tell people how to make them and I want to do that for a long time because I want to be a movie maker like Ed Wood. The reason I think movies are so important is because movies are the best
 In this film, the director, Lou Ye, has created a pretty good, if somewhat simple and somewhat predictable, plot. The plot of a family who is facing the delicate problem of a mentally troubled and violent son. The boy is not only violent, but also rebellious and selfish, yet his parents are trying to understand him and help him out.<br /><br />The acting is good and the story is a bit simple, but overall, it's a good film. This film still holds up well and is a good watch.<br /><br />8/10.

 I've read this book and the book is amazing, however, the movie is just as amazing. This movie is a great recreation of the book, one of the best I've seen so far. They adapted it perfectly, they stayed true to the book and you get to see the way Lizzy would act in real life. I think it's even better than the book. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.

 This is a very touching movie about a boy and his father who is a doctor. Both have different views of life and being a doctor and the sacrifices that they have to make. The boy was told by his father that he was to do something special and he did not know what that was. The father was very strict and did not want him to get hurt. He was the one that was supposed to be the protector and the hero. The father was very sick and the boy did not know how to help him, but he did it with love and respect. This movie is about family and love. I was very moved by this film and I think everyone should see it.

 This is one of the best Disney comedies of all time. The script is very funny, the music is great and the characters are great. It's a nice example of how to do a Disney comedy well. It's not as good as "The Jungle Book" but it's still great. It's a very enjoyable movie, especially for young children. The animation is great. I especially like the look of the animals in the jungle. The singing is great. And the plot is pretty good as well. I prefer this one over "The Jungle Book" as well. I recommend this movie to every Disney fan, especially if they are a kid. This is a great family movie.

 This is a perfect example of why the old saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" is totally wrong. This is the best trilogy of movies I've ever seen. I'm 14 years old and I'm completely in love with the movie. I'm a huge fan of the first two movies and since I've seen the third, I'm even more in love with the series. I'm definitely going to buy the DVD's when they come out. I really hope that they make a part four, but I'm not sure if they will. Anyway, I would recommend this movie to people 10 and older. There is a little bit of language and there are some violent scenes, but it's very safe for children to watch. I have watched this movie more than 50 times, and I still love it. My favorite character is Flix. He's just so funny. At the end of "The Incredibles" the bad guy is the one who gets everything. It's not the Incredibles who get everything, so I'm glad that this movie wasn't like that. The Incredibles are the heroes, and they are the ones who do get everything. This is a perfect movie for anyone who likes
 This is a good movie that has a lot of suspense and suspense. I found the acting was very good and the story was also good. I had my doubts about the story at the beginning, but I did not have any once I found out the story.<br /><br />I recommend this to anybody who likes the suspense. I thought this movie was very good and was well worth the money. I thought this movie was worth seeing and having seen it I would recommend seeing it again.

2.0 out of 5 stars What do you mean her car was in the middle of the road? Format: DVD This movie is so terrible!! I didn't think it could be worse than "The Ring" but this is really really bad. The "mystery" is not a mystery, the main character is not a character, the main character is a little girl calling herself a detective, the main character is not a detective, the main character is a little girl trying to be a detective, the main character is not a detective, the main character is a little girl trying to become a detective, the main character is not a detective. I could go on and on but I won't because I'm tired and this movie is so
 To make a long story short, I loved it. It had an interesting story, a great action sequence at the beginning of the movie, and it had a great cast. I think that they should have shown more of the development of the relationship between the two main characters, but that's minor. I loved the way the two characters are portrayed, and the way they fall in love slowly and without much fanfare. And the ending was a little bit of a surprise. I really liked it. I'd give it a 9/10.

 It was interesting to read the comments on this movie. I think they are very very unfair. This is a wonderful movie. I don't know how it would have turned out if I had directed it. But I know it would have been a very big disappointment. The screenplay by the late Israel Horovitz (I am so very sorry for his loss) and the wonderful story by the late William Kotzwinkle was an excellent screenplay for a movie.<br /><br />I think it is a great movie. I have seen it many times. I didn't know it until I saw the movie that this is based on a true story. I have never read the book, but I think it is wonderful. I don't know if this movie could have been made if the story was true. I think it would have been a hodgepodge of truth and fiction. I think it is a great movie.

<br /><br />I think the acting by the cast was wonderful. I think the direction by Aviva Kempner was great. I think the editing was excellent. I think it is a great movie.

<br /><br />I think the soundtrack was great. I think the songs
 I saw this film in an art-house cinema in Chicago, and I was quite impressed with it. It is a film that I would like to see again, and I may just get it on DVD. I was interested in the film because of the settings, and because of the fact that it was made by a native of Chicago. It is a film that deals with the music scene in Chicago, and centers around a club where a lot of the local bands play.

I found the film to be very interesting. It had a great soundtrack, and the film was well-acted. It was a very good film.

The film is about the music scene in Chicago, and it shows the different bands that play in the clubs around the city. The film had an interesting plot, but I was a little disappointed with the ending.

The film is about a young guy in his early 20's who is trying to make it in the music scene in Chicago. He is trying to make it as a musician, and he is trying to get his music out there. He is trying to get the local bands to play his songs, and he is trying to get the clubs to listen to his music.

The film
 The first time I saw this film it was in the daytime and I thought it was a documentary. I was amazed at the amount of time that was spent on each of the characters and the amount of detail that was given to each one. I would recommend this film for those who love a good character study. I felt like I was watching a documentary about the lives of the characters that were portrayed on film. I give this film an A.

A character study of four people living in a small town. There's a lot of detail in this film, but it's not overdone. The film is set up like an interview with four people. The camera is very close to the characters. There is a lot of dialogue in this film and it's not overdone. The film is about a year in the lives of four people. They are told their stories one by one.

The film is set in a small town and the film is about four people. All the characters have their story told in the background. It starts with the story of a young boy. His name is Kevin and he is the son of a man who works at the paper mill. He is a very bright boy and he is a very helpful kid
 This is a pretty good film. It's a little on the slow side, but not too bad. It's one of those movies that you really should watch with a friend because you are both going to have different opinions. Some people will hate it and some people will love it. I'm one of the people that loved it. I like the fact that the main character was a nice guy that was always trying to help people. It's like your everyday movie, but with a twist of just enough violence to make this one a good movie to watch. I don't think it's a very scary movie, but it's not a movie that you watch on purpose. But that's what makes it good. It's a movie that you watch on accident and say, "Oh, let me see what else is on TV." That's what I like most about it. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, but it never gets old. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good, creepy movie.

A great little movie

Author: Andrew
 For a movie that is set in the future, this is certainly a very believable film. What distinguishes it from other science fiction films is that it deals with the idea of a war that is fought with a combination of real weapons with simulated ones. The film shows the use of various non-lethal weapons including lasers, plasma, and other electronic weapons that are used in warfare. The movie also talks about the use of the internet as a means of communication, something that is surely to occur in the future. The movie also shows us what the future holds for the military in terms of body armor and other protective gear. The movie does have a few holes in it, but the Sci Fi Channel does a great job of covering them up with a great story.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction movies.

8/10

Ps: Just a little comment about the movie. I noticed that the man with the electronic piece on his head was wearing a hat. That suggests that this is not the future, but rather a parallel universe.

 I rented this "classic" for the first time some time ago, and it was one of the most entertaining and entertaining movies I've ever seen. It had all the momentum of a great film, but it also had all the elements that made it a classic. It was a great story, with humor, intrigue, suspense and a solid cast. Gene Hackman, of course, was spectacular as the sleazy reporter, who is drawn into a world where the stakes are high and the stakes are life and death. He was in great form, as was his co-star, Mickey Rourke. Hackman's character was one of the best I've seen in a long time, and the supporting cast members were just as good. The cinematography was great, and the direction was excellent, especially for a film that is 50 years old. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good story, as well as all of you who appreciate good acting, and a great setting and atmosphere.

5.0 out of 5 stars Just as good as you think it will be. Format: DVD I'd heard a lot about this movie, and that it was the best movie about journalism I'd ever seen, and I decided to
 I watched this film, because it was shown on TV, and I have to say, it was far better than I had thought it would be. It is a relatively short film, but I was surprised at the depth of the characters, as well as the emotions they displayed. I would recommend this film to anyone, as it's not your typical film. Although the main character, David, is a bit of a pain, most of the time, the story is about him, and the others. There is so much to the story, it is hard to fully describe it, but I would say that this is a very good, but not great film. It is about a group of people, who are all strangers to each other, who are all in the same situation. There is one who's life is going well, and as it progresses, the other's life goes down, one at a time. You don't see the whole story at once, but as you watch it, you feel the emotions and feelings of each of the characters. <br /><br />I would recommend this film to everyone.

 Wow, what an interesting and unique movie. I've seen a lot of movies, but this one is one of the best I've seen. I enjoyed it to the fullest. I loved the fact that it was a movie about a woman and not a man. I thought that it was good that the main character was a woman since it was a time when women had many more rights than they have today. I liked the fact that the main character was a natural, not a phony and not a phony. I liked the fact that the main character was not a woman who was trying to be a boy, but a real girl. The main character was very much like a real human being. I also loved the fact that the main character was a girl. I mean, there's a lot of movies out there today that have girls in them. But this one was very refreshing. I also liked the fact that the main character was not a totally perfect girl, but a real person. I thought that the character of the main character was very interesting and I thought that she was very convincing. I really liked the character of the father. I loved the fact that his character was a very caring father and I loved the fact that he was very supportive
 I really enjoyed this movie. I thought at first that it would be just another horror movie but it really turned out to be a really good movie. The acting was good and it was also really funny at times. The movie was a little scary but it was a good scary. It was also a little long but I didn't mind. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. I thought it was a good movie and I would definitely see it again.

 This is a great movie if you want to see some old school gangsta rap. The movie is about an old school gangsta rapper named Ray (played by John Travolta) who is down on his luck and is trying to make it big again. Ray also has a daughter, named Rayna (played by Jada Pinkett Smith), who is a singer. Rayna is the new female rapper in town, but she can't quite put it all together. Rayna is hoping that Ray will write her some songs so that she can get her career going. Ray's manager, Zee (played by Samuel L. Jackson), has plans of going after Rayna.<br /><br />This is a great movie that shows some of the old school gangsta rap that I miss. I like the old school gangsta rap, but these days it is mostly rap that is not so good. This is a nice movie that is filled with old school gangsta rap. There are some good songs in this movie that are performed by the main characters. That is the best part of this movie. The movie is not one of my favorites, but it is still worth watching. I like to watch movies that show the old school
 When I first saw this movie back in '04, I knew it was a comedy. It's a bit more than that, but perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. It's about the simple task of creating a water slide for a new park, in the middle of an arid desert, with only enough water to last a few days. The crew is down to the wire and ready to quit, until a very unlikely hero steps in, and helps to save the day. It's a classic tale of how the right man in the right place can help save the day. It's a great story and delivers it beautifully.<br /><br />The cast is great, setting the mood perfectly. It's all about the comedy, the characters and their on-screen chemistry. That's what makes the movie so enjoyable, not just the great story, but the way it's told. The actors are all believable and they all have their moments as comedic actors. The one person who stands out as the comic relief is the wise-cracking CEO of the company that builds the slides. His lines are funnier than the others, and he made me laugh more than anyone else in the movie, even though he's himself not
 I was born in the 70s so i grew up watching this series, and i think this is the best one i seen. I really like the idea of a family that doesn't have a mother,father or even a sister, but they have a kid who is their son and a dog who is their dog. I think this is a really good idea for a series as it is a really good story and you really get to know the characters as they go through their adventures, and it can be funny but it also can get serious, and it is really good to watch. I really like all the characters and the dog, the dog is really funny and i like the way he gets himself into trouble all the time, i also like the way he talks, and i like the way he is a lot of work to keep an eye on, but i think the woman who is their mother is a bit boring, and i also think she is a bit of a party animal, but i think i would like her as a friend, but i think she is not as good a mother as she thinks she is. I think this is a brilliant series and i love this show and i hope i see it again sometime in the future as i
 I found this movie to be very good, in fact I think it was the best of the three movies. The storyline was great and was what kept you interested. The acting was great and the characters were very likable. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see an action movie with a story line and a good ending.

8/10

I will most certainly recommend this movie to all of my friends. The highest recommendation I can give to this movie is 10/10.

I hope that you guys enjoyed my review and that you go and see this movie.

 It is a shame that this film is so incredibly difficult to find. The acting is good and the script is intelligent, but the film is ruined by some of the worst sound quality I have ever heard in a film. The film was shot on 16 mm film, which is supposed to have a better sound quality than 35 mm film, but the sound is so poor that it is nearly unwatchable. The dialogue is almost unintelligible because of the noise in the background, and the film is so noisy that you can't even hear the music. The film makers were unable to get a sound system in the film, and this is a big mistake. A major disappointment.

3.0 out of 5 stars A "B" thriller with a twist Format: DVD This thriller covers the usual bases of a "B" thriller. It has a great deal of detail in the plot, and some of the best acting in the film. The acting is not particularly good, but they do a good job. The plot is not completely original, but it is well-written and has some good twists. The problem with the film, at least for me, is the poor sound quality. The dialogue is very difficult to understand, and the
 A young man and his wife are sent to a mental hospital, where he is to undergo therapy. His wife looks on and wants her husband to be cured. She stays in the hospital, awaiting his return.<br /><br />This is one of the more interesting and well-executed Czechoslovakian films. The acting is good, the plot is interesting and complex and the cinematography is interesting and beautiful.<br /><br />The film also features Tereza Kesovani, who is now more known as one of the founders of Czech new-wave cinema. Her acting here is excellent.

The film is a story of a young man who is going to undergo therapy at a mental hospital. His wife is accompanying him there.

 You can't help but see a little bit of yourself in "The Big Lebowski" - the ultimate anti-hero who gets caught up in a crazy plot. Jeff Bridges plays the titular character, a wealthy white guy who lives in a big house that he inherited from his millionaire parents. He's as much of a slacker as his friend and business partner, Walter (John Goodman). They're both into bowling, drinking, and getting laid. They have a huge bowling bag full of money too. When they get stuck in a Mexican resort without any money, they start a big quest to get it back. It all goes wrong, but the plot is so ridiculous that you can't help but fall in love with the characters. Bridges is a genius at playing the main character; he's smart, funny, confused, and angry. He's not an action hero, but he's cool on his own. The characters are so funny and well-written that you can't help but fall in love with them. The dialogue is so smart and funny. The plot is so ridiculous that it's worth it. "The Big Lebowski" is one of the best comedies of all time.

As a side note,
 I really enjoyed this! It was very unique. I was very satisfied with the ending. I think that this movie is going to be a huge hit. I would definitely see this movie again. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

 I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but I remember it being an amazing movie. I'm not sure if it's just my memory playing tricks on me, but I think it's very comparable to "Six days of the Condor". I won't give away the ending, but I'll tell you the whole movie is a bit of a mystery, and really intriguing. I was never really a fan of the "spy" genre, but I must say I really enjoyed this movie. It has some great twists and turns in it, that I think are well executed. If you liked "Six Days of the Condor", you will definitely enjoy this movie. I give it a 9/10

 In the early 1960s, this was the most popular movie in the history of New York City. The movie is about a young man who falls in love with a beautiful dancer and he wants to marry her. But, she's promised to another man and his parents have set up a "marriage" between the two of them. The movie is funny, entertaining and full of great dancing and great music. All of the dance numbers are memorable including the "Souvenir of Hong Kong" dance routine. The movie is just as entertaining today as it was in the 1960s. The 3-D version of "Singin' in the Rain" is excellent and the dance sequences are as good today as they were when the movie was released. I highly recommend this movie for all of your family and friends.

 This movie is a story of a young man who is a political activist and his life, family and the people around him. This is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think about your own life. You will relate to the life of the main character who wants to do something and fight for his cause. You will also relate to the character of his mother who wants to do something but cannot see her way clear. This movie shows you what is happening in the world today and how one man can make a difference. This is a movie that everyone should see and everyone should be moved by it.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie and I would definitely watch it again. I would also recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie that will make you think about life and the world around us.

4.0 out of 5 stars A surprisingly good movie for a political film. Format: DVD I usually don't go in for political movies, but this one was surprisingly good. This is a story about a young man who becomes involved in the movement in his country. He is a kind of political activist and his life is very similar to ours, he has a family,
 I saw the film when it was screened at the San Francisco Film Festival, and I was moved to tears. This film, made for a miniscule amount of money, and shot in a few days, is remarkable in its simplicity and its honesty. It tells the story of a little girl who is trying to find her mother's killer. The film follows the little girl through a series of flashbacks, all of which are based on her own memories. The flashbacks are bad, in that they are not very well shot and the story is disjointed, but the film is actually enhanced by this, as it gives the film a dream-like quality. The film is shot in black and white, with a very stark, almost surrealist quality to it. The film is based on a true story, so the film is not simply a work of fiction. It is also important to note that the film's composer and co-director, Michael Almereyda, is the son of the film's director and co-director, Jeffery Blitz. This is the film that made Blitz famous, and it was the film that made the director famous. This film had a profound effect on me, and it has easily influenced my work.

 This movie is a lovely piece of work. It doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. It is a light-hearted, romantic comedy that is both funny and touching. It has a lot of funny moments. It is a movie you can watch with the whole family and have a good time. It is romantic without being sappy. It is full of witty one-liners and funny situations. I think it is a movie for all ages. I would love to see it again. It would be fun to watch with a group of friends. I think everyone should see it. I love it!

The movie is about two guys who want to get married to the same girl. She is the one they love. She is the one they want to spend the rest of their lives with. They both have different ideas. One thinks they should get married. The other thinks it is a bad idea. So they end up in a competition to win her heart. In the end they both win. They both get the girl. They both get married. They both live happily ever after. I think that is pretty much the message of the movie.

The movie is a little different than some of the other romantic comedies that
 The story is basically about a girl (Senpai) who's at her high school, who's in love with her childhood friend (Kokoro). But when she bumps into a guy who'd been a friend of her brother, she falls in love with him, much to Kokoro's dismay. But, is he really the one she's fallen in love with, or has it just been a one night stand for him?

This movie is about high school romance, and it's a pretty good one. While it was a bit predictable, it's still a very good movie. The characters are pretty well developed, and the story line is pretty good. The only problem is that it was so predictable. There are only a few scenes, in which the story is a bit different, but even those scenes aren't very intense. The movie could've been a lot better.<br /><br />The acting was great, the characters are very likable, and the story could've been better. It's still a good movie to watch, especially if you're a fan of romantic movies, or if you just want a good romantic comedy.

My rating: 7.5/10

 I've seen a lot of films about the military. I've seen a lot of films about Vietnam. This is one of the best. It's about a military company in Vietnam and how it's really not about killing people and about how the soldiers don't get to see the same things that the people back home do. It's about love and war and how love and war can both be a wonderful thing. If you like war films, you'll like this film!

I give this film a 10 out of 10!

I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting, the story, and the music all come together to make a very beautiful film. It is about a group of soldiers that have to fight in a war that they don't believe in. It's about the love between a soldier and his girl. It's about the love that they have for each other and the love that they have for the country. It's about how men are betrayed when the only thing they care about is the love of their country. It's about how those soldiers can't get back to their families and how they feel about their country
 I really liked the main character in this film, in a way, he's like me and I'm not too proud of it, but he's just a normal, typical guy that's actually quite lovable. I just liked how he was "normal". He's not a swashbuckling adventurer, but he's not some dumb, generic character that's supposed to be "attractive" or "cool". He's just a regular guy that doesn't have a lot of money, and he doesn't have as many friends as he'd like, but he doesn't seek out a girlfriend or try to be some kind of rebel or anything like that. He just tries to have a good time, and like I said, he's just like me. I've been through a lot of the situations with him, and for the most part I'd say that he's a pretty good role model, but I don't know if I'd want to be him, because I've never been to a club and I don't know anyone that I'd want to have a drink with, but I do have a lot of great friends.<br /><br />I really liked the ending of this film, it's just a nice way to
 This is a very well made documentary about the life of one of the most important, influential, and controversial people in the history of the game of chess. It is a very fast paced documentary, and the actors (Jeremy Irons and Michael Shannon) do a very good job in bringing their characters to life. This is not your typical "chess movie", these people would not be sitting here if they were not brilliant, and it is not your typical documentary either. It is extremely educational, and has a lot of interesting information that moves along nicely. Be warned though, it is very, very long, and not for the easily bored. I know it sounds like a contradiction, but it is true. I thought the beginning was a little slow, and I just wanted it to be over, but it was worth the wait. I was very impressed with the level of detail that Jeremy Irons put into the part he played, and it was a very enjoyable documentary overall. I highly recommend this documentary, though it is not for everyone, it is definitely worth seeing.

So I saw this movie for the first time about a month ago. It is about Bobby Fischer
 This film is a great success it is a comedy, a drama, and a love story. I watched the film because of the hype and because of the fact that is was directed by Kim Ki-Duk. I am a big fan of Kim Ki-Duk's work. He is a great director, and his work is always very challenging and funny. The film is also very different from his other work. The film is about a Korean family. The film starts with a suicide attempt by an over-emotional boy. The family tries to help the boy, but he's too emotional and the family can't control him. They are then visited by a mysterious woman who seems to know everything about the family. The film is very funny and really keeps you captivated. The family is very funny, and they are all very different from one another. The film is also very good technically. The film has a very good sound quality, and the images are also good. The film is very highly stylized, and the film also has some good camera work. The film has a good ending, and I am glad that I saw the film. I give the film a 8/10.

3/4 of the way through
 I am a big fan of the History Channel and I just finished watching the original mini-series, "The Kennedys" which is a great show to learn about the history of the Kennedy family.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that the mini-series didn't give the viewer a complete portrait of the family. Some of the historians have said there are no tapes of the family talking which leads me to believe that there were a lot of disagreements between Robert and Joseph Kennedy. This lack of tapes makes it difficult to really know the whole story.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that the mini-series did not include the family's involvement with politics. There were no clips of the family giving speeches or campaigning for political candidates. I think it would have been interesting to see the family behind the scenes.<br /><br />I found that the mini-series did a good job of capturing the Kennedy family. Although it was only 10 episodes, it was a great show to learn about the family.<br /><br />I would recommend the mini-series to anyone that is interested in learning more about the Kennedys.

 A story of a family torn apart by a very sinister secret. This is a movie that takes it's time to tell the story but doesn't drag along at any point. The film is very well shot and the music by Jennifer Warnes is a perfect fit. The performances are spot on, especially by Annabella Sciorra as the "bad" mother. I only wish it was longer.

<br /><br />The synopsis says the movie is about "a mother, a daughter, and a son." In reality, it is about a mother and a daughter, and a son (who is only mentioned in the film). The story is about how this family copes with a very shocking secret that was kept from them for many years. The secret is the reason for the split between mother and daughter. Their relationship is what the film revolves around. The mother, who is dying of cancer, tells her son the secret so he will take care of her daughter. The mother makes sure that the daughter is aware of the secret, but she never tells her son. The daughter becomes angry with the mother because she was never told. She is also angry with the son, because he wasn't told the truth either. The son
 I watched all of the Devil's Rejects 12, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It was really fun, and the soundtrack was really good.<br /><br />I liked the characters, especially the killer and his wife, and the demon cowboys. I also liked the love story between the killer and his wife. It was different, but it was a good story.<br /><br />I like the way it was filmed, and the way it ended.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, or just likes a good story.<br /><br />8/10

 I watched this movie because of it's plot and character development. I was hooked. The movie is about a man who falls in love with a college student that he once knew. The movie is about them trying to get back together. It's about the hardship they go through and the decisions they have to make to be together. After watching this movie I think I should go back and watch every scene again. The plot was very good and I have no complaints. I recommend this movie to people who like romantic comedies like with a little bit of drama. I give this movie 8 out of 10.

I watched this movie with my friend on her birthday, she asked for it as it was a movie she'd seen before but I had never seen so I thought it would be a good idea to watch it with her. She loved it and I did too, it was funny, romantic and had a great plot. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, I didn't really like it but my friend
 This is a story about relationships that, when examined closely, are not as perfect as they seem. This movie is a compelling watch, with a great cast and a dramatic story. While it is not my favourite movie, the acting is excellent, and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a movie that will hopefully be released on DVD.

8/10

Watch it because: It is better than you think.

Don't watch it because: It is not your favourite movie.

P.S. The soundtrack is great. By far my favourite soundtrack from this movie. I also love that the movie is set in Australia.

P.P.S. I love the way that the movie ends.

P.P.P.S. I'm not entirely sure why I like this movie. It's not my favourite movie, but I do like the way that it ends, and the cast is great.

 This is a very touching film. While it does have some rather comic moments, it's more of a drama than a comedy. The acting is excellent, and the film really gets you involved in the story and the characters. The story of the movie is this: A teenager (along with his sister) is left in a coma, and his family is told that he has a 50/50 chance of survival. They desperately want their son to survive, and they try everything they can to see that he does. The boy's mother, played by Susan Sarandon, is desperate to save her son and makes every effort she can to help him. The boy's father is played by William Hurt, and he has to deal with the fact that his son is in a coma and there's no telling when he'll wake up. And the boy's sister, played by Haley Joel Osment, is left to deal with the fact that she must tell her mother that her brother is in a coma, and his chances of recovery are slim. It is a very emotional film, and you really connect with the characters and the film. I really liked this film, and it's definitely one of my favorite movies. My only complaint is that the ending was
 It is a good movie. It is surprising how a good movie can come out of the US. I had not heard of this movie but it was on TV a couple of nights ago. It is one of those movies you like to watch because it is so good. It is based on a true story. I don't want to give away anything because you might want to see it for yourself. It is about a young woman who marries into a family of detectives. She is attracted to the family and the family loves her. The family is amazed with her because she has studied the human mind and is able to read people. It is not simply a whodunit. You see the family is torn apart by the murder and their feelings of guilt. It is a good movie. I think it could be made into a good TV series. I have seen other movies about detectives but this is one of the best. It is a good movie about the human mind and about marriage. It is not boring and it does not get too dark. The cinematography is well done. The director is a woman.

 'Mesmerizing' is probably the only word that can be used to describe this new horror-thriller, directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick. 'The Shining', as we all know, is one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and I must say that this movie is just as good. If you like horror movies and haven't seen this one yet, then I strongly recommend that you do. This movie is so creepy and atmospheric, I doubt that you'll be able to sleep well the rest of the week.

The film starts with a young man, Donny (Brady Corbet) and his girlfriend, the beautiful and sexy, Doris (Kirsten Dunst). They are on a vacation in Colorado and Donny has decided to stay in a hotel room with his girlfriend, without telling his parents, who live in New York. Donny is a bit of a weirdo and he has a phobia for blood. They are staying in a resort and the only thing that Donny and Doris can do in the daytime is to go to the pool. Unfortunately, the hotel is haunted and Donny is quite nervous, despite the fact that he's staying in a room by himself. After

 This is a very enjoyable film and is a feature-length update of the original. The story is interesting, the relationship between the two main characters is believable and the action is solid. The music is good and gives the action some extra punch. The film also has good special effects. The only negative is that there is not a lot of humour in the film and the story is a bit predictable. Still it's a worthwhile film and should not be missed by those who like a bit of action and a good story. Rating: 8/10

The film is about an alien that can only be seen by a few people. A small boy sees it coming out of his mother and the alien decides to come back a second time. This time it goes on to kill a lot more people. The alien then takes the boy to the police to prove he is not lying. The police take the boy to a secret lab where the alien is being studied. But the alien escapes and goes on a killing spree. The boy manages to get back to his mother and the alien goes after him. Luckily the boy has the alien's blood in his body and can see it again.

 I first saw the movie on DVD in the movie store and I couldn't believe it. I had heard about this movie for years and then finally I saw the movie and I was blown away. This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen. People usually expect to see the typical happy movie but this movie was not that. This movie was a great reminder of how people in general can be cruel to each other. I am a big fan of movies that have a lot of emotion in them and I think this movie has a lot of emotion in it. It really makes you think about life and this is a true story. I believe everyone should see this movie because it was an inspiring story.

 The first thing that caught my eye was that it was only two and a half hours, the second thing was that it was in French. I wanted to see this film, but knew that it wasn't going to be an easy watch - in fact it was a very slow, methodical, and slightly depressing film. It's a story about a young boy (Pierre) who lives in a run-down village which is trying to recover from the war. He lives with his mother (Marie) and older brother (Claude) in a small cottage. Their father (Louis) occasionally comes and visits but is not involved in their lives. He's a writer and has been away for some time writing. One day, he suddenly appears at the door and announces that the family are moving to a new house to be built nearby. They are to move the next day. He gives them a bag of money and sets off back to Paris. The film then follows the family and their efforts to move. The film is slow and not a lot happens but I didn't mind as I found it really interesting. There are some really beautiful shots of the countryside and I think the film was very well shot. The performances of the actors were outstanding and although
 This is one of the best dramas I've seen. It's a great story, and it has a surprise ending. It's a film about a man who's dying and his family's attempt to get his affairs in order before he dies. It's about the family's attempt to make him the center of their lives, their attempts to make him feel important, and the lengths they go to in order to do so. It's about love and relationships, and the way we all try to make each other happy. It's a film about the people who surround a person and make that person feel alive. It's a film about love.

 I was so surprised, after I saw this movie, that all the critics didn't like it. I mean they actually hated it! I thought it was the best movie I've seen this year. I thought, and still think, that Walter Matthau is the best actor, ever. He just goes for it. The movie itself is about a washed up guy trying to get his career back on track. But, it's not just about that. It's also about a man's life and his feelings toward his wife. He also is a father to a son, who has a son of his own. It's a great movie. A great family movie. If you're looking for a movie with a big heart, look no further. And, if you're looking for a good time, this movie will keep you happy.

If you love a good comedy and you love Walter Matthau, then this is a movie that you must own. Matthau plays a washed up action hero who has to
 Since I have nothing better to do than sit and watch "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" over and over again, with a cold drink in one hand and a pen and paper in the other, I thought I would write something about the show. I have to admit that I am not much into writing, but I feel that I have a little insight into the show, as I have watched it several times and have also watched a few episodes of "Lost". So, I will try to write my thoughts on the show, and include some of the plots, and such. I will try to avoid spoilers so that people who haven't seen the show can read this.<br /><br />The show is on the CW, but it is shown on the WB in Canada. It is shown on the Sci-Fi Channel in the US.<br /><br />The show revolves around a teenage girl named Buffy, who is in a high school called Sunnydale High, which is a very strange school that is surrounded by a deep dark forest. The school is fairly large, and is well-maintained. It has a large library, a large gymnasium, and several other common areas. The school also has several student dorms

 No matter what you think of this movie, it's worth watching. It's not a horror movie, and it's not a comedy. It's a movie about a man's obsession with his ex-wife. It's completely weird, completely off-the-wall, and completely real. It's not a movie you see every day. I've seen it twice, and still couldn't put it down.

The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the ending. But this is a minor quibble.

Give it a chance. You'll be glad you did.

 I think this movie is very hard to find, because it was only available on VHS and DVD. I did not like the first movie in the series very much, but I liked this one much better. The effects looked better and the overall picture was better. I think that this movie is better than the first one, because I think that the first one had some problems. I like the fact that the characters are more developed this time. I really like the fact that the main character is more vulnerable. I think that the director did a great job at using a lot of different types of film techniques. I really like the fact that the director decided to make this movie more realistic. I also like the fact that the director decided to use a lot of different actors. I also like the fact that the movie was more realistic. I also like the fact that the movie was more scary. I think that the main character is a little more likable this time. I also think that the main character is a little more likable this time.

 In the late 1800's, John Henry Newman (Jeremy Irons) is the most popular novelist in England. He has written a novel that is highly controversial and is being reviewed by the press. Newman's wife, Sarah (Imelda Staunton) suggests that he review the newspaper for a change and he is reluctant. One day, he goes to the newsroom and meets the editor, Richard Hannay (David Morrissey). He asks Newman to review a novel called "The Empty Chair" and he agrees. He reads the novel and his review is negative and he suggests that the book is a fraud. A few weeks later, Newman receives a letter from a man named H.G. Wells. He asks Newman to meet him at a local pub and he agrees. He is surprised when the man that shows up is Richard Hannay. <br /><br />The story that follows involves a secret society that wants to get the book banned. They have hired a man named John Darcy (Rupert Everett). He hires Richard Hannay to kill Newman and he attempts to kill Newman with a freshly boiled egg. Newman's wife, Sarah, and Richard Hannay end up in bed together. Richard Hannay ends up killing the
 I loved this movie. It was cute, funny, and the acting was great. It was a lot of fun to see Kendra, Patrick, and the gang back together. I think it's great that there are new episodes of iCarly coming up on TV soon.

I have a feeling that this movie is going to be as popular as the iCarly episodes with the same cast. I can't wait to see it.

I recommend this movie to anyone that likes iCarly and to anyone that likes good acting.

 The film is rather short, yet the lead actors are good and the lighting is beautiful. The story is simple and not very deep, but is well told. The lead performances are good. The cinematography is quite good, and the story is quite nice. Don't expect something that you haven't seen before. The movie is quite easy to watch and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes foreign films.

 Tengoku to Jigoku is a very well-done, if not a bit too much, horror flick, with an interesting premise (a cross-over between Mortal Kombat and the world of Hell - not quite as dark as Final Destination, but still pretty dark) and a very good cast. It also has a few surprises, like a cameo from the main character from the Mortal Kombat film, and a very good twist at the end. It's also a very fun film to watch, which is better than many other horror films of this type. It's not perfect, but it's a fun, good-looking film, which is a good thing. I recommend it.

 A lot of people had a problem with the way the film was written and directed. I disagree.<br /><br />I found the storyline very interesting and interesting characters. There were some moments that were over the top and silly, but overall it was an entertaining film. I was impressed with the actors who portrayed the characters. I especially liked the character played by Christopher Walken.<br /><br />The film was a bit predictable, but it is entertaining and I was interested to see how it would end.

<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and recommend it to others who enjoy films based on classic books.

<br /><br />I give this film 8 out of 10 stars.

<br /><br />The film is rated R for mature audiences.

 I was looking forward to watching this film. I saw the trailer and thought it looked very funny. I watched the film and was not impressed. I thought the film was boring and sort of childish. The actors were not very good and there was no chemistry between them. The writers of the film seemed to have no idea what type of film they were making. I was quite disappointed and was left feeling that I had wasted my time watching the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It is not funny, not exciting and not very interesting. I do not think this film is worth watching.

I thought the film was rubbish. The characters were not funny, the plot was not exciting and very predictable, the acting was not very good and the effects weren't very good either. I thought the film was not very good and would not recommend it.

 This is a very good documentary about the rise and fall of the comic book industry. It's amazing how resilient the public has been, considering that comic book stores are few and far between and the industry is still going strong. It's also interesting to see that the industry wasn't always in such dire straits, and that there were times when the comic book industry was more lucrative than Hollywood. This documentary also highlights the fact that comic books can be more than just an art form. They can be a medium for political and social commentary. This is in many cases a more effective medium than the traditional media. The documentary is well done and it takes you back to a time when the industry was thriving. This is a great documentary for people who have a fascination with the comic book industry. It's also a good documentary for those who are interested in the history of the comic book industry. This documentary is good for people of all ages. It's definitely worth a look.

 This is one of the most enjoyable musicals I have ever seen. The songs are all quite good, and it is fun to see the performers really getting into their roles. The comedy is very funny, and the dance numbers are quite energetic. It is obvious that the cast and crew were having fun making this film. It is a good way to celebrate the end of the second season of So You Think You Can Dance, and it is a nice cap to the season. It is also a good way to see some of the stars of All That. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to watch good music and has a sense of humor.

 The film does have a few flaws, but overall it is a very good film. The acting was great and the story line was very believable. I liked the fact that it was so realistic to everyday life. It was nice to see some good old fashion values still prevalent in the world even though we live in the "modern" age. I liked the way that the director showed how people were influenced by the media and how people were constantly looking for something to believe in. I think that the film was very well done and was a nice surprise. I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking to see a good film that is not too over the top.

An excellent film, from the opening to the end. It tells a simple story but well made. If you like films that have a bit of reality to them, then this is for you. It reminds me of films like "The Sixth Sense". The story is about the main character trying to find redemption for his brother's death, who has been "murdered" by the local gang. It is a very touching film, with a real life feel to it. The acting is
 In this film, a group of people in a small town of small town have to deal with the fact that their world is about to change forever. This is a film that will make you think and feel. It has great performances by the entire cast. It is a very slow film. There is a lot of time spent on dialogue, which is essential to the story. It is a film that takes a lot of patience, as it doesn't move quickly or "jump" into the action. The ending is beautiful. I loved this film. It is a very unique film. It is a film that will stay with you for many years to come.

P.S. This film is in the Criterion Collection, so the DVD is very good.

 I have recently seen this film and I loved it. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this film and it has a great cast and I like the fact that the film is set in the country and not in the city. There is a lot of humor and the characters are great. It is not all about the romance, which I love. I would like to see more films like this one.<br /><br />I love the fact that it is set in the country without too much technology in the way of cars and phones. And then there is the fact that the town is like a close knit community that you really want to be a part of. It reminds me of a small town in America with the main characters of the film being the "townspeople."<br /><br />I think you will enjoy this film as much as I did.

 I saw this movie first in the theater, and I was so shocked that I didn't know what to do. It's a very beautiful film. It's really a good thing to see a movie like this. The story is really interesting and you can really understand it. I like the way they portrayed the Jewish family. The way they act is really good and I like their way of life. The music is really nice and it's kind of touching. It's a really good movie because it's true to life and it's really interesting.<br /><br />I really recommend this movie because it's a really good movie.

I saw this film in the theatre and it was completely captivating. The film is about the 1930's in Palestine when the Zionist Movement comes about, and the impact it has on an ordinary family. The film, in a way, is about how a family's life is changed by a political movement, how people were literally pushed into the sea or killed for no
 Lola (2001) is more than a pleasant film. I remember with pleasure that I saw "Lola" at the 2000 Cannes. The film is a nice mixture of comedy, romance and a little bit of true-to-life situations. The film is very funny at times and is also very touching. The actors are all great and the director shows a good eye for detail. The film is not so "perfect" but the director shows some real talent. I don't see many films that are worth watching but "Lola" is definitely one of them.

 It's a wonder that this film has been ignored by the so-called "critics" of the film world. Even the New York Times has not reviewed this movie. "The Big Kiss" is a very funny, quick-witted, insightful movie about the late-night, last-chance, out-of-town, "what the hell am I doing in NYC" drunken-cruise-ship-thing. The great cast, which includes Gene Hackman, Michelle Pfeiffer, and a young Danny DeVito, is a big part of what makes this film so great. It's a little more risqué than the average film, but not too much (other than a little nudity), and I think it's one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. It's a great way to end a Saturday night in NYC. And to think, it's available on DVD.

 I'm a huge fan of Stephen King's more mainstream work and this is definitely a more mainstream flick. I'm not sure that I would have liked it so much if I had not been a fan. It does everything I would expect from a Stephen King film, which is to say it's a little cheesy but has a good story. There are some great performances from the cast, especially from Molly Ringwald and Nick Nolte. Nolte is a bit of a bum in this movie but Ringwald is a great character and I loved her. It was weirdly romantic but King's sense of humor is very strong in this movie. The characters he creates are pretty interesting and Ringwald's character at least has a reason for being the way she is. King's love of music is shown in this movie; the score is amazing and the music at the end of the movie really is a nice touch. I'm not sure it will appeal to all King fans but I think it's a great choice for King fans looking for a mainstream movie, as it uses King's style but doesn't have the same dark and disturbing undercurrents.

 I have seen this film four times this weekend. I am not giving it the full 5 stars because of the negative reviews I have read. I thought it was very well done, and the story was very original.<br /><br />This is a film about the search for meaning in life and the inability of humans to find meaning in life. One moment it looked as if Noah's Ark was real and another moment it looked like it was a movie set. The story was very believable. If a film can make you believe in the movie, then it is a good film. Not all movies can do that. I think it was a very good film.<br /><br />It is a good film to watch with your children. It is not for kids that are easily frightened by ghosts, monsters, and the undead.<br /><br />It is a good film for the whole family. I would also recommend it to a friend or relative that has a passing interest in the paranormal. You may find that your friend or relative enjoys it as much as you did.<br /><br />I would like to see a sequel to this film.<br /><br />I give it a 3 out of 5.

 I just watched this film for the first time. I really enjoyed it! The characters were interesting and well developed. I thought all of the actors did a great job, especially the two boys. It was a great story, with a lot of conflict and some humor thrown in. The music was very good, and it is impressive that this was a low budget film. It really looks like it cost a lot more. In fact, it looks as though it was shot in a studio somewhere. The cinematography was also very good. It was shot in a lot of different locations, which was nice. I did think it was a bit long, but I enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good drama.

(By the way, the name of the town is a little misleading. The movie takes place in a town called "Lynnwood." The name of the town is actually spelled Lynnwood, however the show was filmed in "Lynnwood," but the town is spelled Lynnwood in the movie.)

This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.

 I've said it before and I'll say it again: this movie is a must-see! I love this movie. It's funny, it's touching, it's sweet. I love the way that the movie shows the development of their relationship and how the relationship develops into something so much more than just friends. This movie is great for people who like romantic comedies, but it is also great for people who like movies that are simple and fun. I also love how the movie starts off as a romantic comedy and then slowly morphs into something more as the movie progresses. It's a unique movie and I really can't think of any other movie like it. It's really hard to find another movie that I can say that about. I hope this movie does well and I hope that people take a look at it. I know that I will.

By the way, I love this movie so much that I even wrote a story based on it. It's called The Girl of My Dreams. You should check it out!

 The first time I saw this movie I remember being so amazed that it felt like you were watching a Disney movie. This movie has so much heart that I cried at the end and I have yet to see a movie that will ever make me cry like this one did. I have watched this movie over and over again and I still feel like it was the best movie I have ever seen. I love this movie so much that I even have the soundtrack, I listen to it all the time. This movie is worth buying the soundtrack for. I have seen this movie so many times and I just can't get enough of it. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies. I have seen many movies that I have loved and I have seen many movies that I have hated. I tried to think of a lot of movies that were good but I always come back to this one.

 This is one of those films that you can watch again and again and never tire of it. It is a solid film that holds up well over a decade later. The writing is first rate and the acting is excellent.

<br /><br />You're probably wondering what "The Candidate" has to do with this review. Well, I saw the movie at the same time as this, and the characters in this one are so similar to those in "The Candidate" that it's impossible not to compare them. Although the films are similar, they are not the same. The "Candidate" film is way better, in my opinion.

 The man who directed this is the same man who directed the original "The Shining" and the brilliant "The Exorcist". I had always been told that "Rosemary's Baby" was a very good film and wanted to see it. Unfortunately I do not own a VCR and was unable to see it as it was not playing in any of the cinemas around me. I found myself at the local video store and asked the clerk if he had it and he said "yeah, It's about 10 minutes long, is it that good?" I nearly fainted. I went home and rented it and boy was I surprised. I think it was a VERY UNDERRATED film and one of the best films of the 70s. It is very similar to "The Shining" in that it is a pretty dark film but is a good film nevertheless. The acting is great, the story is well thought out and the direction is top notch. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in seeing a good movie. It's a little slow in the beginning but the film is worth seeing the entire way through.

Rosemary's Baby is a fantastic film.
 This is one of my favorite movies, and probably the best, although it is quite long. I loved the acting and the cinematography. The story is just so sad. It is a must see. I recommend to anyone, especially anyone who likes romance. I am a sucker for that.

 I have been a fan of Stephen King for over 20 years and read all his books. I have read most of the movies that were based on his books, but this is by far the best.<br /><br />This movie is a great example of how a high-quality movie can be made, shooting only in Maine and using local talent. Not only are the acting and the sets great, but I was really impressed with the special effects, the re-creation of the town of Castle Rock and the many references to the book (without being heavy-handed). I laughed at many parts and cried at others. The only thing that did not work well for me is the ending, which I thought was too abrupt for a movie of this length. But, overall, I would recommend this movie to Stephen King fans, especially those who have read the book.<br /><br />1 out of 5

Now the book is on its way to the screen. It looks great!

I thought that this movie would be about the book,
 This is an unusual movie. It's a musical comedy/drama about a young Italian widow who meets a young Italian widower. They fall in love and marry. They move to the United States. The man makes a lot of money in the movie business and is cheated out of it. He meets a woman and they fall in love. She has money, but she has to go back to Italy because she's sick. He goes to Italy to rescue her from her husband and family. He meets her in a train station and they go back to America. It's all very giddy and cute. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't think it's a great movie, but it's a very nice, light movie. It's a very cute love story. The characters are very much likeable. I think they make a very sweet couple. I think they would make a good couple. The songs in this movie are very good. The movie is very sweet. I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. It's good for a date night with a friend. It's not a very serious movie, but it's cute and amusing. I think it would be a good movie to watch with a friend on
 I've seen a lot of kung fu movies, and have even made one. So I tend to be somewhat critical of the genre. I see a lot of bad kung fu movies. This movie is not one of them. This is an excellent movie.<br /><br />The plot is excellent. A young man discovers that he has a mysterious power that he can't explain. He is a good kid, and doesn't want to hurt anyone. So he takes his power and runs away, and lives in the mountains. A man is sent to find him, and he decides to use his power to help the people. Excellent plot.<br /><br />The dialogue is excellent. The characters are believable, and the situations are brought to life frequently.<br /><br />The fighting is excellent. The fighting is very realistic. It seems that the actors are actually doing all of the fighting. I wish that I had the skills to be able to do that.<br /><br />The story is excellent. Sure there are some holes, but it's still great. I don't know why there aren't more reviewers who have higher ratings on IMDb. How does IMDb allow a movie like this to get so
 I saw this movie as a child, and I loved it. I was always a little bit scared of the Mad Hatter, and he made me laugh each time he was on screen. I love this movie still, and I think everyone should see it. I used to own the VHS version, but I haven't seen it in a while. I highly recommend it.

 This movie is filled with enough suspense, drama, humor, and some very funny scenes. The plot is very suspenseful and filled with a lot of twists and turns. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was laughing and crying throughout the entire movie. The script was excellent and filled with a lot of funny lines. This movie also had a lot of great actors in it that were all very talented. This movie is a must see for everyone. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see a good drama/suspense/comedy. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen.

 Ah, the '80s. The decade with the worst and best music. The decade that made me realize I was a hopeless romantic at heart. The decade that gave us 'When Harry Met Sally' (which is still the best movie of that decade), 'Ghostbusters,' 'Crocodile Dundee,' 'The Karate Kid,' 'Footloose' and 'Top Gun.' The decade where I discovered and fell in love with the greatest band that ever lived, The Smiths. <br /><br />It was while watching this documentary that I realized I was a hopeless romantic. It was the last Smiths song I heard before the movie and it was a poignant reminder of how the band started. It made me sad to learn that the band was broken up when I was in college. I couldn't understand it then, but watching this documentary confirmed my feelings that the Smiths was a band that was too good to last. I hope they reunite in the future and play their music for us again.

A documentary about one of the best bands ever.

Author: vinceb
 I saw this movie on a whim, thinking it might be a good choice for our cable network's movie night. It was a great choice! It was funny, fun, and very different from any other movie we had seen. We all really enjoyed it, and it was the "talk of the town" for weeks. I think it is one of the best movie choices we have made. (It was also the first movie I had ever seen on HBO.) The cast is superb, and the cast members are wonderful together. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially to people who don't want a typical "romance" movie. You won't regret seeing it!

 I have seen this movie so many times that I could probably recite it verbatim. My favorite scene is when the character, who appears to be the second lead, is interviewing the lead character's daughter. He asks her whether she remembers her father. She responds that she was only four years old when he died. The interviewer pretends not to hear her and asks her how she can remember him if he was that young. There are several things that make this scene so good. First, the character is positioned in the scene as the interviewer. He is not the lead character. Second, the child is not a child, but a woman in her twenties. Third, the interviewer is unable to let the child know that he has heard her. The fact that he has heard her is an important part of the scene. Fourth, the woman is playing the role of a child. This is a very difficult role to play. The fact that the woman is not a child makes it an even more difficult role. It is nearly impossible to act as a child. The last excellent part of the scene is the child's response to the interviewer. She tells him that he is too young to remember her father. This makes the scene realistic. The interviewer
 This is one of the better films to come out of the Soviet Union. It slots right into the tradition of the old Marxian classics. The central character is a revolutionary who, after the revolution, is imprisoned, and has to struggle to regain his life. The film was shot very quickly on location in Moscow, and it is easy to see why. The story is engaging, the acting is better than almost anything we've seen from the Soviet Union, and the music is still good today. The film is set in the 1920's, and there is the odd reference to the Russian Revolution, which is odd considering the fact that the Soviet Union did not come into existence until after the Russian Revolution. But there is a reason for this - the film was made in the midst of the Russian Revolution, and the director, before making this film, had made a film about the Russian Revolution. There are no shortage of films about the Russian Revolution, and I have not seen any which are as interesting, and engaging as this one.

It is a shame that the film has never been released in the West, as it would be an easy film to market.

Overall, a very good film.

 I saw this movie at the movies in the early seventies and I had much fun with it. The star is Telly Savalas who is always good to see on screen. In this movie he plays a guy who has his own little family and they are all up to no good. There are also other characters in the movie who have fun with Savalas and his wife but they just have a little thing in common with the main characters. The movie is also good to see because there are so many stunts and one is a car chase through the streets of New York. It has a little bit of everything and it is worth seeing. I don't know if it was ever released on VHS or not.

***,**

-Made in 1972, directed by Gordon Douglas.

The main character, Savalas, stars in this one, along with Nancy Allen, and of course, the ever reliable Vincent Gardenia. The story is about two couples who are about to be married and are involved with a group of criminals who are planning their robbery. They have to work together to stop them. It's pretty much a run of the mill crime
 I've never really been a fan of horror trash, but the genre has certainly matured in the last few years, and thanks to the likes of Wes Craven, and others, we have some seriously entertaining films to enjoy. Along with the truly great, we have the not-so-great, and "Monster Squad" is a film that is not quite as good as its reputation would suggest. The film is a fun, albeit dated, treat that is probably best suited for a younger audience.<br /><br />The film opens with a group of orphaned kids playing a game of "Monster Hunter", with several different monsters rearing their ugly heads to try and kill the kids. We are then introduced to a group of kids called the "Monster Squad", who, on the surface, are a group of kids who really want to be a part of the "Monster Hunter" game. The film introduces us to the members of the "Monster Squad" who are as follows: Glenn Danzig as Dracula, Brinke Stevens as a vampire, J.D. "Krull" as a werewolf, and Margot Kidder as a mummy.<br /><br />It is soon revealed that the "Monster Hunter"
 This is a great movie, and I have seen it at least three times. The plot is fairly simple, as a group of teenagers get trapped in a school during a storm, and must deal with a pack of insane, murderous zombies. The acting is great, but I will give the nod to the zombies. They are very creepy, and their actions are very frightening. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a horror fan.

This film is one of the best zombie films I've seen, but I think that it is too short. I love how the slow motion effects work in this film, and the music is very good. The acting is excellent, but the zombies were so creepy, I had to turn the lights off in the theater.

 With a budget of around $1.5 million, I think it's safe to say that this film had less than a million, but that didn't stop it from getting distribution. The film, which has been compared to something like "Night of the Living Dead" or "The Big Sleep", is about a group of citizens who have to defend themselves against the walking dead. The film was shot on location in the Florida Everglades, and while it's obvious that the film was made cheaply, it also shows the beauty of the area.<br /><br />The film is not perfect, but it is a fun, well-written, and well-acted horror film. I haven't seen anything like it, and I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel.

4.0 out of 5 stars a nice little film that never really got the credit it deserved. VINE VOICE Format: DVD | Verified Purchase It's easy to see why this film never really got the recognition it deserved. I think it would be hard for any film to stand out in the horror genre and it's really not fair to compare it to any other films. It's still a good film and if you're a fan of horror films
 I really like this movie. It's a very sweet, lighthearted movie. Robert Downey Jr. is a great dramatic actor and his performance in this is particularly outstanding. I think he could have been even better than he was as Tony Stark. I think the writers should have made him a bit more of an antihero, though. In this movie he is a very likable guy and they could have made him a bit more of a bad boy. His character has a very happy ending in this movie and I would have like to see him develop a bit more as a character in the other movies. The movie is very funny, too. There are many memorable scenes. I believe that this movie is a must-see for people who enjoy light-hearted comedies. The acting is great. I would definitely recommend this movie.

 Since I was in Junior High (I think) i was always reading comic books, and I saw the movie when it came to my high school. I liked it when I was younger, but now it seems to have gotten a little old, and a little silly. The story is very predictable. The characters are a lot less interesting than the ones in the book, but the actors do a great job of the roles. The special effects are wonderful and impressive for a movie of this type. I would recommend it for any comic book lover.

 I saw the film on two occasions, once at the Cannes Film Festival and once at "Elle" magazine's screening at the Tate Modern, London. Both were packed out and the audience were very enthusiastic. I'm not a film journalist, but I did watch the film to make sure that I wasn't missing out on something that I might like, and so I can really say that the film is challenging, different and thought-provoking. I'm not sure that I agree with every single aspect of it, but I also don't think that I have missed out on anything that I would have liked to see. I think that it's fair to say that the film is deliberately provocative and that the film is more about the ideas behind it than the actual film itself. I think that the film is very clever and well made, and I think that I want to see more films that are similar. The director is a very clever person, and I think that there will be lots of interesting films to come out of his ideas.

Also, the DVD is well produced and is an interesting document of the film.

I can't recommend the film highly enough.

 This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't understand why it is so underrated. It is true love, I will watch this again and again. I like the way the characters do not let their past control their future. They are there for each other when they need to be. I love this movie, it is so good and so emotional. I have seen this movie over and over again and I just can't get enough!! The music is incredible and the actors are wonderful. I have too many favorites, but I can't pick just one. I love this movie. It is just so good!

Some of my favorite parts are when the father shows up at the hospital to take the child. It is so touching. I also love the end when they are walking in the snow, they are so in love and so happy, and it is just beautiful. This is a must see.

 Well, I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel this morning. I was very impressed with this movie. I wasn't expecting anything too exciting or original, but it sure was a good time. The movie was very well done and I thought the special effects were good. I've heard all of the complaints over the past few weeks and I have to say, I don't agree with most of them. The acting was good, I thought. The story was original, and the fight scenes were well done. I had heard complaints about the animal violence, but I don't think that's really an issue. This is a movie based on a comic book, and a comic book has lots of violence between the characters. I mean, look at Spawn. This movie is probably much less violent than that. So, I still highly recommend this movie. It was surprisingly good. I will probably see it again in the future.

 I saw this movie in a movie theater in the mid 80's and I was a kid. I knew nothing about the movie and would make up my own dialogue and characters. I've seen this movie many times now on TV and always look forward to it. The movie itself is great and I can't stop watching it. I didn't even know people could play a violin like that. It's epic and I love watching it.

 I watched this movie and i cant believe how good it is. I love it, i was crying in many parts of the movie and it was just fantastic. The art direction is stunning and the music is gorgeous. The characters are real and the acting is stellar. <br /><br />The story is original and the acting is superb. The only thing thats not done well is the musical score. It could have been better and the songs are a bit boring. Otherwise a great movie about a man who wants to be a father but can't seem to make it happen, and ends up getting pregnant.

I saw this movie for the forst time and i loved it. I have seen it 2 times and i am so glad that i have. The acting, the music and the story are just fantastic. It is a real touching story of a man who wants to be a dad, and cant. The music is beautiful and the acting is great. I recommend it, if you want to see a good movie and you want to cry, this is the movie for you. And if you want to see a great movie and you want to cry, than this is the movie
 This is one of the few films to have ever made me cry. I saw it on VHS when I was little, and I remember crying like a baby. It is just simply a heart-felt story about a little boy who seems to be the only witness to a horrific murder. I think that is what makes the film so effective, that there is no doubt about the innocence of the little boy. He is a child, and he has a child's naivety about the world around him. The movie moves along at a good pace, and the mystery is one that keeps you guessing until the end. The ending is one that will not leave you in disappointment. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes mystery or a good story.

It's a story that makes you feel like you know the characters, as you watch them grow up, as they learn new things, and as they go through life, having to make their own destiny, and grow into being men. It has a good pace, and a good story, and you get a lot of appreciation for the characters as they grow, and learn new things. It's a story that
 "The Country Girl" is a wonderful showcase for two great, older actors. Jean Arthur plays an aging career woman who takes an extended stay in the country with her husband and her flaky daughter. Jeanne Crain and Robert Cummings are wonderful as the two men who fall for her. The film is really about the women's relationship which is more provocative than the men's. Some of the scenes in the country have a very nice feeling to them. One scene in particular where Jeanne Crain is watering her garden and giving her daughter a lesson on the flowers is a very sweet one. The film is so nice because it shows that a woman can be successful and still be a good mother and wife. It shows that a woman can be successful and still be feminine. I think that it is one of the best films that I have seen recently. It is so sweet and so charming. I give it a 9 out of 10.

 I was a little surprised that this movie is getting such a raw deal. If anything, it's a real 70's comedy. It's not perfect, but it's really funny. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and it's obvious that the writers, directors, and actors were enjoying themselves. It's also a nice change from the usual Hollywood drivel. If you like Peter Sellers, you'll love this movie. It's a little offbeat and funny.

I'll say this much: It's better than watching a PBS documentary of the same topic. From the opening scene, you're in for a wild ride.

I thought it was hilarious. Even though it's a fairly long movie, it's not boring. I like to watch this movie every now and then. It's a fun, crazy, and hilarious movie. I guess I'm not
 This is a good film for people who like a good action pack film. The plot is simple, a group of friends find a missing person. They start to investigate, but the missing person is a hunter who has been searching for a monster. The monster tries to kill them, but they survive. The plot is fairly simple, but there are some nice plot twists that are not too predictable. This is a good film for people who like a good action pack film.

**SPOILERS**

The plot is fairly simple, but there are some nice plot twists that are not too predictable. One of the things I liked about the plot was that it was not predictable. The plot was interesting, but I was not a big fan of the monster. This movie does not have a bad monster, but it just does not
 There is a documentary on the making of this movie called "One Man Band" (2001). I believe it is available through the DVD section. It's only about 60 minutes long and is a fun look at the making of the movie. You can tell it's the same people who made the movie. Also, the film is on the DVD, it's a feature-length documentary about the making of the movie. It's really interesting. It also has interviews with people involved in the movie. There is also a blooper reel, showing some of the mistakes that were made. I don't think it is on this DVD, but I'm sure it's available.

I was surprised that when I first saw the movie, it reminded me a bit of "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle." Both are farcical comedies that involve a couple of stoners who go on a road trip. And, they are both very funny. I've always thought that "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" was one of the funniest movies ever made. It's a great parody of stoner culture. And, I think that "Far From Men" is probably as funny as "Harold & Kumar Go
 This is one of the most beautiful and touching films ever made, and is probably one of the best films ever made. It is funny, heartwarming, and extremely well-made. The film focuses on the friendship and love between two men, and the conflict they go through as they try to fit into society. The film is extremely well-made, with excellent acting, a great script, and excellent cinematography. The film is about two gay characters, who are in love, but are in constant struggle to be accepted by the world around them. The film is set in England, and is about the two main characters, Tony (played by Stephen Fry) and George (played by Rupert Everett).<br /><br />I have seen this film several times, and each time, I have something new to admire. This is definitely one of my top ten favorite films, and I will be recommending it to everyone I know.

A Triumph

 This is one of my favorite movies, even though it is in Italian. It tells a story of a young boy named Vincenzo and his mother. He has a brother named Giorgio, and a father named Don Luciano. Their lives are changed when Giorgio is sent away to a boarding school. Vincenzo tries to take care of his brother, but then Don Luciano sends Vincenzo away to school.<br /><br />Vincenzo is sent to a boarding school. Vincenzo is shy and doesn't have much confidence. He is in love with a girl named Maria. She is very nice and kind. Vincenzo is worried about his mother and brother.<br /><br />Vincenzo is very shy, but he has a lot of friends at school. He is in love with Maria, but she is the girlfriend of his brother's best friend. They are both in love with each other, but they don't know how to tell each other. Vincenzo is very close to his best friend, Sergio. He thinks of him as a brother, even though they are not. Vincenzo is constantly being picked on. He
 Here is a very good, serious and important film that deserves to be seen by many. It is also a touching story of one man's search for his purpose in life. This movie shows that there is a lot of good in the world and it is possible to do everything you want to do, but to do it in a good and respectful way. The movie shows how the good things in life can be lost in an instant when one takes things for granted. When things happen that you don't expect, you stop taking care about them and you lose them. The movie is also about friendship and how important it is in our life. The character of the main character is very well played by Kevin Sorbo, and the supporting characters are very good. The movie is also very uplifting and entertaining, very refreshing indeed. It is a movie that is well worth seeing. The movie is not very long, and it will not be boring. I recommend it.

A story of the importance of life and friendship

 I have always wondered 'what would have happened' if the Monkees stayed with the Mamas and the Papas and made more great albums with them. The movie follows this line of thought. The songs are great and I like the editing. It is a really good movie. So what would have happened if the Monkees stayed with the Mamas and the Papas and made more great albums with them?

The Monkees' first album was the first album by a band to have 5 hits on the charts at once. It was the first album to sell over a million copies. It was the first album to win a Grammy. It was the first album to sell over 10 million copies. The Monkees' second album was the first album to have 4 million copies sold. The Monkees' third album was the first album to sell over 20 million copies. The Monkees' fourth album was the first album to sell over 20 million copies. The Monkees' fifth album was the first album to sell over 30 million copies. The Monkees' sixth album was the first album to sell over 40 million copies. The Monkees' seventh album was the first album to sell over 50 million copies. The Monkees' eighth album was

 I think this movie is a must see for anyone who is a fan of SyFy. The plot line is a little weak and predictable, but the acting and special effects are what make the movie worth watching. The movie continues the story started in the first movie. If you are a fan of the first movie I would highly recommend the second. You won't be disappointed.

The results are in and the crowd-sourcing campaign to name a new plant in honor of the late Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, is a resounding success! View the results here.

Paul Allen, who passed away in October, had a very special passion for plants, especially ones that were endangered. He was an avid gardener who helped save the rain forests of the world through his philanthropy. He contributed to a number of plant conservation programs including the New Orleans Botanical Garden and the Rain Forest Alliance.

The new plant will be planted in the Seattle Harvard Rainforest exhibit at the University of Washington Botanic Gardens.

 This is a wonderful film. The story is well told and the music is beautiful. I had never heard of Loretta Young prior to seeing this film and was very impressed. She was a great actress and I'm glad I was able to see her in this movie. I thought she was beautiful. The supporting cast was outstanding. I loved the relationship between the two sisters. It seemed very real. I had read some of the reviews and some people really didn't like this movie. I don't know what they were expecting. To me this is a nice romance of the old days. I think it is a shame that some people will not enjoy a good film if it doesn't fit their idea of what a film should be.

The only thing that I didn't like about the film was the ending. It seemed abrupt. The other thing I didn't like was the music. I have to say that I didn't care for it. I'm sure that many people will like the music. I just don't care for it.

I would recommend this film to anyone. It is a good film to watch on a rainy afternoon or something.

I give this film an 8 out of 10.

 This is one of the only school movies where I actually enjoyed the movie. I know that the acting is bad and the dialogue is bad, but I still like the movie. I think it has a good plot and the story is easy to follow. I think the acting is good for this movie. I also like the ending of the movie, but I think the ending is a little bit to sad. It's too bad that the main character died, but at least he is happy. The acting is also good for this movie. It's not the best acting in the world, but it's good enough. The actors do well for the characters they are playing. I think the acting is good for this movie. The acting is good for the movie.

<br /><br />I think that this movie is a good movie to watch if you want to just watch a movie and not think. This movie will let you relax while you watch the movie and it will be fun. This movie is not a very good movie, but it is still a good movie to watch.

 I have seen this film at least 10 times, and I am still amazed at how beautiful, strange and humorous this movie is. The actors are of course wonderful (especially John Cleese, who as always is absolutely fantastic), and the script is a winner. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, especially if you're a Cleese fan.

I don't understand why this film isn't more popular, but it's a shame because it's such a great movie.

-Renee (9/1/1999)

The great and brilliant John Cleese. He is one of the best actors and comedic geniuses on the planet. I highly recommend acquiring this film.

-jimmy (6/27/1999)

This is a brilliant film, with a brilliant cast, who all turn in brilliant performances. I bought the DVD and watched it again and again, and I still find it very funny.

 A very good movie. It's very good in the way that it is quite realistic. I can only think that it wasn't easy to do, since it is about a little girl and all the difficulties that she might have had. The way that she has to deal with the situation is admirable. I also liked the way that the child was portrayed. I think that it is a very good movie and I hope that they will make a sequel, but in this case I hope that they will make it a better movie. I hope that they will show the child being taken away from her family and her getting used to her new family and the children that she has to live with. I hope that they will also show the child dealing with a new school and new friends. I also hope that they will show the child dealing with a new family and trying to adjust. I hope that they will also show how the child copes with her new home and her new family. I think that it could be an interesting movie. I hope that they will make a sequel. I hope that they will make this a better movie. I hope that they will show more things. I hope that they will show the child in her new home and how she is
 A fairly good movie with a great cast, the acting is good and the characters are unique and likable. I like the way the movie balances the classic murder mystery with the family drama, which really helps ground the film in reality. The movie is also fast paced and well done, it moves along at a nice pace. The acting is good, with a few people standing out, in particular, Joe Mantegna and a great supporting performance from Victor Garber. The story is interesting and the cast is a great mix of both old and new, it is refreshing to see a good mix of actors in a movie. Overall, a good movie, and a good story, well told.<br /><br />8/10

 "The Longest Yard" is a very good movie. I saw the movie a couple days ago and am very happy with it. I thought the movie was very well written, directed, and acted. My favorite actor was Jamie Foxx. Also, another actor I liked was Burt Reynolds. I think he is a very good actor. I also liked Donald Sutherland. This movie is about an ex-NFL football player named Burt Reynolds. He is in prison for a whole year. He gets a new job in the prison yard where he has to fight other inmates in a football game.<br /><br />I think this is a good movie for everyone. I think it is not a kids movie like Shrek. I think it is a great movie for adults too. It is not a gore movie or anything like that. It is a very good movie and I recommend you go see it.

 Robin Williams is great in this movie as the man who is trying to find out who murdered his wife, but then he turns out to be the one that did it! I wish there was a sequel, but I guess this will do for now. If you like Robin Williams it is a must see. It is also a great horror movie.

 This is a great film to watch. It is fun, sappy and has some great lines. It is a very sweet romantic comedy about a successful young woman who is looking for a knight in shining armor to come and rescue her from her jobless life. She encounters many men and falls in love with one of the most successful men in the world. He falls in love with her and proposes to her. He is the man of her dreams, but he is married to a woman he loves. There is always a twist in the film and this film is no exception. All in all, this is a wonderful film to watch and to learn how to handle a romantic situation. This film is also a great choice for a date night. It is also a great film to watch with your parents and grandparents.

If you are looking for something a little bit different, this film is great. It is not only fun, but it is also very romantic.

 This is a very good film and was one of the first ones I ever saw. I remember when it came out on video and I would rent it all the time, and I never got tired of it. I just watched it last night, and I'm still not too old to enjoy it. The acting and special effects are very good, and the story is quite good. It's a film that will pull at your heart strings, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

 I rented this movie because it was part of the bargain of renting 5 movies for $9.99. It was worth the money. It is an adorable, funny film. I thought it was a great movie for anyone who likes animals or likes to be in a movie theater. A lot of animation is used to tell the story. All the animals are adorable and I loved the music used. I loved this movie and I think it is a must see if you like animals or like to be in a movie theater.

<br /><br />I watched this movie with my little sister and my mom. We all thought it was great. This movie is definitely one you need to check out.

<br /><br />I recommend this movie for anyone who likes to be in a movie theater or for people who like animals.

<br /><br />I thought the movie was very cute and I loved the music.

<br /><br />I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

 The other reviews for this movie are pretty funny. I was only about 8 at the time, but my family and I went to see this movie, and I got to say that it was one of the few movies I have seen that I have actually enjoyed. I loved the part where the old lady died, and the little boy cried and cried. I also loved the part where the little boy was in the attic. I found that to be very funny, and I think it would of been even funnier if I understood some of the language that was used. I still love this movie to this day, and I hope to see it again sometime soon. I still have the VHS tape, and I would like to get the DVD. I would recommend this movie to anybody that loves a good comedy.

 This is a good movie, although a bit on the long side. It's a bit slow at times, but it works. The setting is another one of those post-apocalyptic movies that have been all over the place lately (i.e. Mad Max). The characters are a mixed bag. The heroine, a former soldier, is a bit naive and slightly stupid. The hero, an ex-special forces soldier, is a bit of a jerk. He's also a bit of a loner, but he's got a good heart, and is able to get along with the heroine. The villain, is a hitman. He's also a bit of a loner, but he's not really the main villain. He's duped into working for a villain, and then works for the hero to get even with the villain. The villain's henchman is a bit of a fool. The henchman, who is a former attorney, is played to the hilt by Harvey Keitel. This guy is a professional killer, and he's skilled and deadly. He's also a bit of a jerk, but I guess you have to be to get along with a professional killer. The villain, is played
 This movie is everything that I love in a horror movie. It's got great acting, a great story, and a great ending. It's one of my favorites. Not only is it a great movie, but it's got a great message as well. This is the movie that I would recommend to someone who doesn't like horror movies. It's a good movie for young and old alike. My favorite part is the ending. This is one of the best horror movies ever made.

 I like this movie. It is not a comedy, but it is not really a drama either. It is just a movie. I like that. It is too often the case that comedies and dramas get so caught up in all the fads that they lose the ability to be just good movies. This movie is not all about the fads in rap music, or urban life, or gangsterism, or all that stuff. It is a good, solid, entertaining movie. It is funny, but it is not all that funny. It is not all that profound, but it is not all that shallow. It is simply a good, entertaining movie. I liked the characters. I liked the concept, and the actors did a pretty good job. I think this movie will be the kind of movie that will be around for a while and will be often watched. I would recommend it to anyone who likes movies.

 I absolutely loved this movie. It was about a man who was sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. He was then placed in the most violent and dangerous prison on earth. He was the only man to survive from the first day he was put in there. This is his story. He survived, he won and he will tell you all about it. I really liked the movie and I can't wait to see the second one. I think this was a great story and I hope it gets made. I think that this movie is about a real person, who is still alive and is telling the world what happened to him on the day he was sent to prison. The man is real and he did survive and he will tell you all about it. I think that this is a great story and I hope that they make a second one.

 I remember watching this back in the 80's, and being very impressed by the animation and voice acting, I decided to watch it again recently and I am very impressed with the "new" animation, I think it's a little more detailed than the old animation but I'm not sure, it is certainly better than most animated films. I like the actors in this film, especially the young girl who plays the alien and the dad who was a little slow on the uptake but he still likeable.<br /><br />I mostly enjoy movies like this because they are a little wacky and humorous, and I really like the visual style of this film it reminded me a little bit of "The Nightmare Before Christmas".<br /><br />I'm glad I watched it because it was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed it.

*** This review may contain spoilers *** I recently saw this movie at the cinema and I really enjoyed it. It was a little different from the usual war movies that I watch and it was a great movie to watch on a boring night at the cinema. I like that it was different and it had a good story line
 I'm a fan of the original film and this new version is great! The graphics are fabulous and the sound effects are just as good. The monsters are new and the animation is better than the original. The voice acting is excellent and the voice of the little girl is the best possible. The movie is a must for all fans of the original movie. There are some references to the original but you have to watch the original first to understand them. I will definitely be purchasing it. I hope though that the original will be released as a DVD so that my kids can see it. It's a great movie.

 The movie is a satire on the world of the super rich and famous. The story line is dark and serious. But its not too dark, it has a great twist of humor. The characters are well developed and played by some of the best actors in Hollywood. They're not just cardboard cutouts. The actors are great and the story line is well done. The story is so well written, that it's impossible to not be enthralled by it. I just can't say enough good things about this movie. <br /><br />I don't usually like to give 5 stars to movies unless they're really really really great, but this is one of those movies that gets it right. It's not quite perfect, but it's close. The actors and actresses are so good, that you would be disappointed if you didn't see this movie. The ending is a bit of a let down, but it's not really important. I'm only disappointed because I had such high expectations for this movie. And as I said, it's not quite perfect, but it's close. I think that's why it's so good. I can't imagine what it would have been like if the ending had been different. If you
 This is a true story of a friendship between two men who appear to be completely different, but who have one thing in common. Both are imprisoned, one because of his homosexuality, the other because of his love for a man. Both are forced to deal with the consequences of their sexuality, and both learn to cope with the isolation and the painful isolation of being gay in prison. Both learn that for the first time in their lives, their sexuality is not their downfall. The one thing that keeps them going is their friendship, their mutual love for each other, and their ability to find the humor, the laughter, and the joy in their situation.<br /><br />Somehow, this story reminds me of the movie "The Birdcage" with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. If you haven't seen that movie, I highly recommend it. If you remember it, you will remember this movie. I think "The Birdcage" was such a good movie because of the friendship between the two men. In "The Cell", the friendship between the two men is so strong that the film becomes a comedy, which is a nice break from all the drama and the sadness.<br /><br />The movie deals with the issues of
 This is a very good film. It is well written (from the actors to the producers), well acted and well filmed. The pace is good and the dialogue is very natural and believable. The subject matter is very timely and the film will stay with you long after you've left the theatre. I would recommend it as a great film to watch if you understand the issues involved and as a great film to watch with family or friends.

I watched this movie on the basis of the rave reviews. I think it could have been a great movie but it is the writer's fault. The plot is so convoluted that you have to concentrate to follow it. It is like watching a bad episode of the X-Files.
 This movie is a wonderful end to a brilliant first season. A great story that leaves you wanting more. It has the same brilliant writing that the first season had. It has a very unique plot and is filled with great characters. The acting is amazing. I just couldn't imagine any season of the show being better than this one. It has such a great story, great acting, and the most original plot I think any TV show has ever had. I love how it was written and the way it was filmed. It's just truly amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story.

This season is a must see. I'm really glad I got to see this. I'm also glad that it was so much better than season one. I LOVE THIS SHOW!

 This is a funny and engaging movie. I will not give away any of the movie's jokes, but I will say that there is a great deal of humor here, and you will probably be laughing out loud at least once. The movie is also very enjoyable to watch. It's a real joy to see a movie that is so original and different from most other movies nowadays, and it's so refreshing to see a movie that is so entertaining without having to be overly serious. I would certainly recommend it to any movie fan, and to anyone who finds themselves in an airport and have nothing to do. I'm glad I saw it, and I like it, and I think you will too.

*I saw this movie at the preview in Burbank, and I agree with the movie critic I read, who said that in the movie there is a lot of "funny stuff".*

*BTW, I read that the director, who was also the writer, used to be a musician, and that he also composed the music. I don't know if that is true, but here is a bit of music that he has composed for his movie.*

 Here is a movie that is not only a good movie but a good lesson. It is a story of a boy that is adopted by a family and learns the secrets of life and love. In the movie there is a lot of lessons that we can learn. One of the most important lessons is that we should not forget our past and people that have gone before us. Another lesson is that we should not be in a rush when it comes to love. Lastly we should not judge people by their covers. This is a good movie for families to see and for children to see. It teaches the important lessons of life and all the lessons are good. This is a movie that has many good lessons to teach and it is a very good movie to show to children.

 The story of a young girl who enters a body building competition, a documentary about a woman who trains horses for the movies, and a documentary about a woman who lives in a trailer to get away from the world. The first two are excellent, but the last one is great because it's the most personal. We get to see what it's like to be out of the mainstream, to be different, and to have to live in a world where being different is shameful. The girls are outcasts, they are never going to be pretty, they are never going to be accepted by the majority, and they are never going to be able to have a normal job. They have to live in their own world, but with the hope that maybe one day they will be accepted into the mainstream. It's a wonderful film, and it makes you think about what it is like to be different, and the lengths people will go to to be accepted. It's a must see film.

 David Gordon Green's directorial debut "All the Real Girls" is a film that deserves far more attention than it receives. While many critics were not impressed by the film, I found it as thought provoking as a film can get. The film deals with the sensitive subject of male insecurity, and the film's main character is a man who is very insecure about his masculinity. The film deals with the issue of whether or not men can ever be truly comfortable with their own masculinity. The film deals with the issue of whether or not men can ever be truly comfortable with their own masculinity. The film opens with a couple named Jim and Cathy (Green and Michelle Williams) going to a party. As they are leaving, Jim pushes Cathy into a parked car, killing her instantly. Jim is found guilty of manslaughter and is sent to prison. While in prison, Jim meets a girl named Diana (Elizabeth Banks) and they develop a relationship. Diana is very outgoing, and Jim is very withdrawn. Jim is also a very troubled person, often having what he calls "night terrors" in which he imagines that Cathy has come back to life and wants to kill him. He also has a very big problem with his own masculinity. He rejects the idea
 Before I saw this movie, I had the impression that it was just a heavy gangster movie. The good thing was that it was well cast and the acting was good; however, the story and script were very bad. The story was very unrealistic. It was like a story from an action movie. It was slow moving, and the dialogue was not good. The characters were not good. They were not likable, and the dialogue was not good. The action was good; however, the movie was not too action packed. It was more of a love story. The morals that was taught was bad, and the music was not good. The music was not good, and the movie was not good. There was nothing that was good about this movie. It was not funny, and it was not intense. It was not a good movie.

I give this movie a D-. This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen.

 The first time I saw this movie I was absolutely blown away. It was unlike anything I had ever seen where I was watching a movie and it was like a real life drama. I think in the film they made a mistake when the character Emily was going to marry the guy she was in love with. She should have ended up with Jake. The storyline of the movie is so good and it has so many story lines that keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to keep watching. The movie is about a guy named Jake(Ben Stiller) who was a missing person that was found in a park with a head injury. He is taken to his Uncle's house where he wakes up from his coma. Jake falls in love with Emily(Mena Suvari) who he was supposed to be marrying. Emily then falls in love with Jake because he is a complete stranger and she wants to marry him.<br /><br />The movie is fast paced and it is a really good film. I really enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it to everyone. It is a really good drama. My favorite scene is when Jake is in the hospital and he goes to go see Emily. He goes in and she is just sitting
 I haven't seen the entire series of "Sleeper" (but have the first movie), but it was the first time I got to see a horror film that I could count on to start off each episode of the show in such a way that I could relax and not be too worried about the plot of the episode. The first episode was so effective that I was less vigilant about the plot, but I did make it up to the end. I've seen "Sleeper" twice, and I am eagerly looking forward to the next movie. The plot is well thought out, the acting is superb, and the music is great. I see no reason why this cannot be successful in the movie market. I am looking forward to seeing it this fall. The bad points are few. I will say that the film is not very long, and that was my only complaint. In my humble opinion, the film needs to be longer, but I cannot count on it being that way.

 I saw this movie on TV, when I was 16, and it affected me in a way that would change my life. I have seen it many times, and I can still feel the emotion that it evoked. I hope that people will not see this movie as a romantic comedy, but a film that contains real life issues in the midst of a good story. It will make you think, and I think it is one of the best films of all time.

I wish that people would pay more attention to the quality of films, instead of the rating. There are films that are rated PG-13, and films that are rated X. I am not in favor of censorship, but I do think that you should not be allowed to see something that you are not mature enough to handle.

In conclusion, this is a movie that every person should see, because it will affect you like it affected me. This is a film that needs to be seen by everyone.

 I had the pleasure of seeing this at the Toronto International Film Festival and it was one of the best films I have seen this year. I think the thing that struck me most was the story was really quite simple. It was about two people who were quite different but also at the same time similar. The story was about two people who were very different in many ways but also similar in many other ways. The two main characters were a computer programmer who was very shy, who had a crush on his neighbor, who was a student at the university, who was a very good friend of the programmer. The programmer was also very shy and had a crush on his neighbor but it was the neighbor who ended up trying to make the programmer make his first move to make the programmer aware of what he was feeling. The neighbor of course was a very nice, very caring person who just happened to have a crush on his computer programmer neighbor. The movie was also about a very interesting topic. It was about a program that was intended to help people to communicate with people who are in different countries and different cultures. The program was only intended to be used in certain countries by professionals who were trained to use the program. This program was not intended to be used by
 I really enjoyed this movie. It was not a blockbuster (no strings attached), it was a small budget independent film, and it was completely different from other movies of the same genre. I am glad that I watched this movie because it was fun to watch. The director did a great job. This movie was not predictable, and you couldn't guess what was going to happen next. The actors delivered a great performance, and I found myself getting involved in the story. This is a movie that you can watch again, and again, and again. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.

***SPOILERS***

I thought the ending was a bit of a let down. It felt like it was lacking something. I am not sure what it was, but I wasn't happy with the way it ended. Sure, the ending was very happy for the characters, but it really left me feeling like there wasn't a whole lot that happened.

However, the ending was still great, and again, I still think it was very original. I will, however, have to watch this movie again to see if I can find what I was missing.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like

 I had never heard of this series, but it is a great one. The story of the shows is about three young men, who go to the "Cabin" in the woods.

The show is not always serious, and has good jokes, which are hilarious.<br /><br />The series is really good and I really enjoyed it.

 I saw this on HBO a couple of weeks ago and I loved it. I've been waiting for a long time for a movie like this to come out. It's the little guy vs. a giant. It's hard to believe that the little guy in this story, the little guy in the film, is played by the same guy that played the little guy in the first one. Johnny Depp doesn't have to be Depp to be funny. He's just playing himself. Jeff Bridges is so funny he can play any role. He is a great actor. I am so glad these two amazing actors came together to make this movie. I hope the little guys don't get upset with the director or the writers. I hope they don't quit acting. I hope they don't get mad at us. That would be a shame. I hope they don't stop being good. I hope they keep on being good. I hope they don't make any more movies. I hope they keep on being cool. I hope they don't get mad at us. I hope they don't quit acting. I hope they don't get mad at us. I hope they don't stop acting. I hope they don't get mad at us
 I've never seen this film, but it's just about the most perfect summer movie I can imagine. I was in the mood for some old-fashioned, carefree fun, and this movie delivered. It's kind of a cross between a James Bond movie and a cartoon. While it's not exactly a huge hit, it's still a lot of fun. The characters are all very colorful, the story is good, and the action is mostly good too. I think this is the first James Bond in a long time to actually have some kind of a plot, since most of them seem to be just action sequences, with very little in the way of character development. This one, on the other hand, is quite funny and quite entertaining. The villians are quite colorful as well, and the story is what I would call "classic Bond." They even throw in a few nice gadgets and a little romance, which is a nice change of pace from the usual. This movie was just so much fun that I can't wait to see it, and if you're tired of the same old Bond flicks, then this is the one for you.

4.0 out of 5 stars A Bond film that is not all about the
 A young man is released from prison after serving a sentence for a murder he didn't commit, and sets out to find the true killer. He has the help of a deaf mute girl, who gets him an apartment and a job, and a prostitute whom he meets at a bar. All of them are becoming victims of the killer, and will have to go on the run to keep themselves alive. This is a very good horror film, and the acting is very good. The plot is very good, and the film is very well filmed. This is one of the better horror films of the seventies. It is not only a good horror film, but also a good film in general. If you are a fan of horror films, you must have this film. This is a very good film.

 This movie is a masterpiece. The acting, the story, and the cinematography are all just so amazing, and the way the story is told makes you feel as if you are really there. The fight scenes are amazing and really make you feel as if you're in the movie. This movie is definitely a must-see if you've ever been interested in martial arts, or if you're even just a fan of action movies in general. This is one of my favorites.

 I was introduced to The Disney Channel in the late 80's and I quickly became a fan of Disney's animated features. Let me just say, The Little Mermaid is the best of the animated features (even better than Aladdin & The Lion King)!!! I love the "Under The Sea" sequence & the way Ariel transforms into a human. I have to admit, I was quite hurt when they did not put "Part of Your World" into The Little Mermaid. But I'm sure they will make up for that in their upcoming movie "The Lion King". The Little Mermaid is a great movie and I am glad I saw it on The Disney Channel in the late 80's. I saw the re-make of The Little Mermaid & the movie was not as good. I think the Little Mermaid was made better for the Mickeys. I rate The Little Mermaid a 9 out of 10.

I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Disney movies.

 To watch this movie is like sitting in a cinema and watching a silent movie.<br /><br />From the beginning, the movie is filmed in black and white, the colors are faded, you can hear the voices, but you cant see the faces. Then, it fades to color, but it is a very soft color, then it fades back to black and white.<br /><br />And yes, I understand that nothing has been added, but the movie is so beautiful, that I think that it is worth it.<br /><br />There is a lot of symbolism, and I think that it is really worth watching the movie. But, if you are looking for just a story, it is not that interesting.

 A story about a family, who's life is turned upside down by the arrival of a little girl into their lives, who they thought they knew. This film has a great cast, who really make you feel for the characters, and really make you care about what happens to them. However, I did feel that the story could have been a little bit more fleshed out, as it goes along, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

 I was very impressed by this Gary Larson cartoon. The characters are very well drawn and the plot is interesting. It is a good story about a family who is moving in a new house. The characters are not just animals but very funny. The story is full of funny scenes and I hope to see more of their adventures in the future. The animation is very good and the songs are very funny. I recommend this cartoon to all who like to watch funny cartoons.

 I watched this movie over and over again when I was a child, and still love it now as a grownup. Superb animation, great story, great music, and a perfect balance of humor and adventure. I still get a little teary eyed every time I watch it. As a kid I didn't understand the story and the ending in particular, but I always thought about it and wished that I could live in that world. I have a little brother who is now 30 and I have been telling him about this movie ever since he was a baby, and he loves it too. I would say that this movie was a great influence on my early life, and I am sure that I would have never become the person I am today if I hadn't seen this movie so many times. I strongly recommend that you watch it.

 This is one of the greatest movies ever made. The performances are all wonderful. I can't think of anything that could have been done differently. The only thing that I wish was different, was that I could have seen it in color. The whole thing is in black and white, and I'm not sure that works for this movie. <br /><br />The movie is about how life is like a game of cards. Sometimes, one has a bad hand, and doesn't get paid for it. Sometimes, one has a good hand and gets paid for it. Sometimes, one is dealt a hand that is absolutely full of cards and can't come up with any more good cards to play. In life, you may win big, or you may lose big, but the important thing is to not to panic. <br /><br />There are loose ends in this movie that are never explained. For example, who is the man in the black trench coat? Why was he in the theater? Is he trying to find the person who left the note on the seat? The reasons behind all of this are never explained.

 This was the first time I watched it, and it was OK. Nothing special, but the two main characters were good. The acting wasn't bad, but the plot was not a good one. The ending is a little weak. I can't tell you why, you have to watch it yourself. I think it is worth a viewing, but don't expect something great.

2.0 out of 5 stars A Film That Could Have Been Great...<br /><br />The film begins by introducing us to our two main characters, a young man named Chris (played by Shane West, who is also in "The Butterfly Effect") and his girlfriend, who is played by Kirsten Dunst, who has been in a few other films, but not really hit it big. After his girlfriend leaves him for another man, Chris is sitting on a beach talking to the guy he is sleeping with, when he is attacked by a man wearing a tuxedo, and a gun. Then, the film goes back in time showing the events that led up to this unfortunate situation.<br /><br />The film is directed by Steve Rash, who also did "The Cell", which was a decent film, I guess.

 I enjoyed this movie immensely. The story is a bit far fetched, but it is a delightful story of a young woman who falls in love with an old friend. The film is funny, and the characters are memorable. In some scenes the actors are so charming in the way they play their parts. I found myself smiling throughout the movie. I am glad that I watched this film, and I cannot wait to see it again.

 I can't believe that I've never seen this film before. I've always loved the work of David Lynch, particularly this and "Blue Velvet".

The characters are very likeable and well-developed. The actors give very realistic performances.

 This is an absolutely brilliant movie. It's a must see for anyone interested in the American Civil War or cinema in general. The acting is great, the characters are endearing, and the story is very well told. I think this is the best Civil War film I've ever seen. This movie is great for all ages, and it has a lot of good morals. It teaches you about the good and the bad of war and shows you the worst of humanity. It's also good for kids, because it shows kids that war is not as cool as they think it is. It also shows them that it can be very dangerous and that innocent people can die.

I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. It's that good.

The soundtrack is great, and the costumes are awesome. The acting is definitely top-notch.

I highly recommend this movie to everyone, and I think everyone will love it.

 "The Skeleton Key" is a good movie. It's not a great movie, and it's not a terrible movie. It's just a good movie. The plot is well-constructed, the acting is not bad, and the execution is pretty decent. The biggest problem that I had with the movie was that it didn't really feel like a horror movie. Sure, there were a couple of creepy moments, but I kept thinking that it really wasn't a horror movie. It's not that it was bad, but it wasn't scary nor did it have the creepy atmosphere of a horror movie. It's more of a mystery/thriller, but still a thriller. The whole movie was a little confusing, and I was getting a little frustrated because it seemed like the film was ignoring one of the main plot points and that left my interest in the movie waning. The best part of the movie was definitely the last 5-10 minutes, it got really tense and had some good suspense, but there still was a sense of confusion about the whole movie. I thought that it was well-done considering that it's the first film by director Brad Anderson and this was his feature-length debut. But, I don't know
 I first saw this film when it was released on video in the early 1990s. It immediately became a favorite of mine. I have watched it many times since and it continues to entertain me. I can't think of a single thing that I would change about it.<br /><br />This is as close as one can get to a period piece. It really looks like the 19th century. I have no doubt that this is a true story. It is not embellished in any way.<br /><br />The acting is superb. I have never seen better. The character portrayals are well done. The plot is good. There is a lot of action. The cinematography is wonderful. The costumes are authentic. The directing is excellent. This should be better known.<br /><br />This is a film that I will never tire of watching. It is one of my favorites. I think it is a great film.

A great silent film

 "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is one of the most famous films ever made. It is a modern day take on the classic "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". The original was written by an author whose name escapes me but the movie was written by Terry Gilliam. This movie is a modern day take on the classic written by Hunter S. Thompson. I had never seen the original but I loved this movie. The movie is great and I just wish they would release a Director's Cut version of the movie or something. The original was great but the director's cut is really really good. This movie is a lot of fun and I would definately recommend it to anyone. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.

 Mike returns to his hometown to try and win the heart of his ex-girlfriend, who is now a successful actress. But he soon finds out that he is not the only one who is trying to win her affections. This was an amusing film with a great cast. I didn't see the original but I enjoyed this one. It was nice to see a well known actor doing a good job. I was surprised to see that the leading man was a smaller guy. The leading lady was also very good. I wouldn't really recommend this movie, but if you want to see a good movie, it's worth looking for.<br /><br />4/5

 I saw this movie in the theater and was blown away. I have always been a fan of the comic, and have read all of the books this movie is based on. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies, especially action movies and is an avid reader of the comic. This movie is an extremely well done adaptation of one of my favorite comic book stories. The special effects are spectacular and the fight scenes are very well choreographed. I am still amazed at how this movie was able to stay so true to the comic book and still make it so good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, even if you are not a huge comic book reader.

 I liked this movie very much. I think all the actors did a great job, especially Anthony Quinn. I also liked Richard Burton, but I don't think he was the best actor in this movie. I think the main actress in this movie was Marlon Brando. He was great in this movie. I don't think he got enough credit for his performance. I hope that he did not get type cast. I think he could have done other movies like this one. I also would like to recommend this movie to people who like movies about the American Civil War.

I just saw this movie last night and it was really one of the best movies I've seen. I can't wait to see it again. I haven't done that in a while. It was really interesting to see all the different actors in a movie. It's so different than a lot of movies I've seen. I really liked it. I really think
 I've never seen a movie that has my heart pounding so fast as this one did. I was really moved by the story and the message of the movie. It made me think a lot about my own life and the choices I've made. I think the one thing that I really liked the best was the fact that it was not a black and white movie, it was a movie that showed the truth of every situation. In this movie, the good outweighed the bad and the bad outweighed the good. I think in this day and age, that is a very good thing to see. The actors were just wonderful and the story was so moving. I've never been so moved by a movie before. I can't wait to see it again to see the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a real movie that is full of real life.

 This is a very good movie that tells the story of a man who has been incarcerated for 18 years. He meets a beautiful woman after being released and they fall in love. The only problem is that she is a white woman who is married to a black man. He has to keep his secret to himself and continue to find love.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are very good, especially the one by the black woman who plays the wife. The supporting cast is also very good, especially the black guy. The movie is very touching and the story is well told. The movie is also very well acted, especially the scene where the wife tells the black woman she will not tell anyone about the white man.<br /><br />The movie is very well directed. The cinematography is very good. The movie does not drag on. The movie also does not talk down to the viewer. The movie is very realistic and depicts what a prison is really like. <br /><br />The movie is also very interesting. I recommend this movie to anyone.

 When I first watched The Last Detail, I thought it was a good, if not great film. It has some very enjoyable moments, but I found it was hit and miss. I've seen it a few times since then and I still find it a watchable film. The main problem with the film is that it is so long. The film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long, and it feels like it. The film is a slow burn and it drags on. The film has a very good cast, and it's got some good actors in it. The film is good, but it's not great. It's a film that is worth the watch.

The Last Detail is based on a book of the same name written by author. Its also based on a real story. It stars Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid. The film is about a young man named Sailor, who is serving time for manslaughter. He is sent to the prison on the last detail, where he is given jobs to do by the other inmates.

 I am a huge fan of Ethan Hawke and I have to say, I discovered this film by accident, it was playing on TV one night and I was so intrigued by Hawke's work that I ended up renting it. I was so glad that I did. This is not to be missed if you like a little dark humor mixed with a little drama mixed with a little romance mixed with a little action mixed with a little comedy mixed with a little horror mixed with a little mystery mixed with a little suspense mixed with a little mystery mixed with a little mystery mixed with a little drama. I sort of lost count. This movie is a masterpiece of the dark comedy genre. If you are a fan of Celine and Julie, you will think this is the best thing since sliced bread. Ethan Hawke does an amazing job as the lead. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. You will be glued to the screen from start to finish. You are not going to see anything like it on the big screen again. Ethan Hawke and Ewan McGregor give incredible performances. Ewan McGregor has never been better in anything he has ever done. He has never been better in his roles as well.

 This is a very good documentary. I was very impressed with the way it was all put together. The film shows the common layman's view of the subject, as well as the more technical viewpoint, which is always good for a change. It also shows the more emotional view of the subject. Very well done.<br /><br />The film was very informative. It gave a lot of insight into what really happens and what a high level of intelligence is needed to develop an art form like this. The film was also very emotive and one could easily draw one's own conclusions.<br /><br />This is a film that could be shown in high school or college classes as a good example of a documentary.<br /><br />I would very much recommend this film.

What were your thoughts on
 I was very excited to see this film, being a long-time fan of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "The 39 Steps." I was not disappointed. The comparisons to Hitchcock are spot on. The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of the twist ending. But maybe that's the point. This film is much more mysterious and less of a "black comedy" than "39 Steps." Hitchcock films have a twist. It is just not a surprise. What is a surprise is the way Hitchcock films are able to unravel the mystery. "Arrival" is much more subtle and ambiguous than Hitchcock films. This may be more of a challenge for viewers. I think this film is more for the cerebral than the visceral. But it works well. The acting is superb, especially from Juliette Binoche. She is very convincing as the woman of mystery. And the subtle humor is well placed. One of the best films of the year.

The story is about a young boy who falls in love with a girl who is in love with someone else. He uses all his skills and tricks to get her to fall in love with him and he succeeds.

 I saw this at the Montreal Film Festival. I think it was a very good movie. I love how well this movie is written, directed and acted. All the characters are well developed, and you feel a connection with them. You like them and you understand them. You feel their emotions and you relate to them. I think this movie is an interesting and touching story about an important and difficult subject: death. It's not a movie about death. It's a movie about life.

The movie is about an old man who lives a little different from the rest of the world. He lives in a small house in the country and works as a car mechanic. He lives there by himself. She is his wife. He is alone. She died a few years ago and she was his wife for twenty years. He lives alone and he is alone. He lives with his memories of his wife and he is alone. He is lonely. He is lonely because he doesn't have anyone and he is lonely because he doesn't have a woman. He doesn't want to live anymore. He is alone and he is lonely. He is alone and he is lonely.

This movie is about a man who is alone and who is lonely
 This movie is a good movie,about a man who feels he was cheated out of his life by a country he loved. As the main character,Robert Mitchum,sits in the library in the film,he begins to think back on his life and his feelings about the events that shaped it.<br /><br />"The Story of G.I. Joe" is a heart-felt story of a man who is robbed of his life by those to whom he was most loyal.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. It has a good plot and is a true story of a great life.

I first saw this film on late night television when I was a young boy. It struck a very deep chord with me and I was hooked.

 It's a huge cast, and a huge story, and an outstanding production. The music is well chosen for the time, and the film is so absorbing and well done, you would never know that it was made in 1958. The film is about the plight of the German people during the time of Hitler's rule. It is a story about a young man who joins the German army. He is sent to a remote location where he is to be trained. The character is well done, and the story is well told. The acting is outstanding, with a very believable young man playing the role of a young man who is trying to learn the ways of war. The cinematography is outstanding, and the staging of the scenes is authentic. The film is well done.

 "The Naked Prey" is a British made film that I think is the best made film I have ever seen. It is a documentary style film with a lot of the footage being taken from the National Geographic books. It seems to be the most realistic film depiction of a native American tribe I have ever seen. The story is about two photographers who go to Alaska and are hired by the government to find a photograph of a tribe that has never been seen before. The footage is from the National Geographic book of the same name. The book is a factual account of the natives of Alaska and the photographer (Eleanor Matsu) and her assistant John (Roland T. Brown) are hired to find the tribe. The two photographers meet with the tribe and learn that they have never been seen by outsiders. The tribe doesn't believe the others exist, but the two photographers leave to see the other tribes for them.<br /><br />The film is shot in the documentary style and there are no interviews. It is just a lot of footage of the tribe and the two photographers. The film is very realistic and you can tell that the filmmakers went to great lengths to make sure that they got the best shots possible. For example, the filmmakers
 I have to say that I hope that this film is not the "end" of John Waters' career. While I'm not a big fan of his, I have enjoyed his films and think that his first few features were pretty darn good (even if I didn't think they were so good after the first viewing). I wish that he would make more films like "Multiple Maniacs" and "Desperate Living". I think that the following films will be okay: "Cry-Baby", "Hairspray", "Pecker", "The Big One", "Serial Mom", "Serial Mom 2: Twins", and "Polyester", and of course, "Hairspray". I just hope that he doesn't end up making films like "Pink Flamingos", "Female Trouble", "Desperate Living", "Cannibal", and "Mondo Trasho". He is one of the few filmmakers that I have wished would make a sequel to one of his films, such as "Multiple Maniacs", "Pink Flamingos", "Female Trouble", "Hairspray", "Desperate Living", and "Cannibal". I hope that he doesn't end up making more films like "Female

3.0 out of 5 stars A good comedy with a few laughs Format: DVD I was very pleased to find this movie on the shelf at a local DVD store. It's a good comedy that's not over the top and it has a few laughs. However there is only one character who is worth the price of admission in my opinion, a main character named Donny who is a small town mechanic who, after being abandoned by his wife, tries to make amends with the family that he once exploited by doing all the repairs on their car. The movie is set in a small town in upstate New York and the plot revolves around a couple of characters that are clearly not your typical A-list
 I've seen a lot of early-1950s films, but this one is one of the best. It's got a great cast and a great script by Sidney Sheldon, and the direction by Josef Von Sternberg is wonderful. The story is about a man who falls for two women, and I can't say it's a film about love, but it's a good film, and it's very well done. The acting by Marlene Dietrich and Ann Sheridan is outstanding, and the acting by Walter Pidgeon and Richard Conte is very good. It's a film to enjoy, and I highly recommend it.

 What a great movie this is! I saw it at the drive in theatre and got to see the whole movie without having to pay for a ticket. All in all this movie is a great movie for all ages. The story line is not complicated but it does not have to be to make a good movie. I liked the way the movie moved from scene to scene. I also liked the way that the movie covered the topic of life. I thought the movie was basically about the importance of family, sports, and what it means to be a man. I would recommend this movie to all my friends. The movie was good for the entire family.

 I'm not a huge fan of the style or the music, I just like the movies. I think this is a good example of a film about a pub that is just for fun, but it's still a very good film and one that I think most people will enjoy. I think it's a very good example of a genre that is quite popular, but that most people don't know all the details about, and I think this is the best of the genre I've seen.

Again, I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a classic, but I think it's a very good movie and one that I recommend to people interested in this genre, and fans of the style. The music is not my favorite, but I think that it's quite good, and works well with the film. There are a few very funny moments in the film, and I think that this is the best of the style of film that I've seen. This is a good example of a genre that tries to be funny, but that doesn't quite work, but this is a very good attempt at a comedy and I think that it's an enjoyable film.

 This is a great film, with great performances and a great story. It tells the story of a young girl, who is raped and left pregnant and the story how she goes through life after the rape and how she tries to get on with her life. It's not just a tale of rape and how it affects people, but also a story about life after rape, and how people cope, and how one person's life can be changed by the rape.<br /><br />The character of the rapist is a very sympathetic character. He is not portrayed as a bad person, he is portrayed as a person who has been bullied and has had a bad life, and he totally deserves what happens to him. I thought the scenes in the school were particularly good, and the scenes of the rape itself were quite shocking, especially the scene where you hear the cries of the girl, but don't see her, and the scene where the rapist kills her.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film.

He was aloof and brilliant. He was a man of great depth and few words. I had read the book, so I knew all the details of the plot. I had read the book so many times that I thought I knew it. Boy was I wrong. I was overwhelmed with the film. It showed many of the things in the book, but they were done in a way to make you feel as though you had never read the book. The cinematography was breathtaking. The actors brought their characters to life. The costume design was fabulous. The production values were exceptional. I had never seen a movie as well done as this. It is a movie that I have watched countless times. I have seen it in the theaters, on television, and on DVD. I think this movie is a classic. It is a beautifully done film. I think that anyone that loves Austen will love this film. I highly recommend this film.

 This is a very good movie, of course an English movie but it was awesome. The horror was good and the story was very intense, that's why I rate it 8/10. I would recommend this movie for everyone to watch.

The actors were perfect, the music was very good and the special effects were incredible.

It was a very good movie, I recommend!

 I have seen this movie twice and it portrays the emotions of a soldier fighting in a war with the best of the war movies. It was the first war movie that I saw where I actually screamed at the screen. I could feel the pain and suffering of the soldier as he fought for his life. The movie was not overly glorifying war, but it did show what war was like. It also portrayed the feelings of being a soldier, which is something that many people do not understand. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see the war from a different perspective.

 I loved the first film and it was a great relief to see a sequel. The film is entertaining and entertaining is a difficult thing to achieve.<br /><br />The film is a real comedy. It is not a comedy that makes you laugh out loud, but a comedy that you will laugh at. I think that the thing that makes it so entertaining is the fact that it is a comedy about vampires. I found it very unlikely that anyone would take this subject seriously. There is no blood or heavy gore, but the film is dark and very funny.<br /><br />This is the kind of comedy that I really wish Hollywood made more of.<br /><br />The only thing that I would change would be the ending. It is not a bad ending, but it is not a nice ending, which is the kind that I would love to see in a comedy.<br /><br />I would like to see this film made into a television series.

 By far one of my all time favorites. If you have seen it, you should have a good time watching it again. It is a fun, light-hearted movie, but it has a lot of good messages hidden in it. If you have seen this movie once, you must see it again. It's a good change of pace from the typical "biker movie".

If you are looking for the usual "biker movie", you won't find it here.

I give this movie a 9/10. It's an excellent movie.

I really loved this film. It is a very compelling movie. It is extremely emotional, but in a very good way. The main character is very interesting, and you will be rooting for him(or her, rather) throughout the entire film. The plot is extremely original and I really would like to see more movies like this. The music and the cinematography are both extremely beautiful, and the film is extremely well directed. I highly recommend this film, especially to those who are interested in Asian cinema.

 This movie is a comedy, but it's a funny, funny comedy. It's a farce, but it's a funny farce. It's a romantic comedy, but it's a funny romantic comedy. The romantic comedy side of the story is represented by the two lead characters, the funny side by the supporting cast, and the farce side by the silly situations and the reactions of the characters.<br /><br />The story is about a man who falls in love with a beautiful, funny woman named Susie. Unfortunately, she's married to a silly, buffoonish man named George. Susie tells George she's pregnant, so he decides to buy a mansion in which to raise the child, and he's determined to marry her even though he doesn't know if she's pregnant or not. The story follows the ups and downs of the "love story" between the two leading characters, and the antics of the supporting cast.<br /><br />The story is extremely funny. The jokes are fast and frequent, and they are delivered by the cast with great ease. The characters are likeable and well-developed, and their actions, reactions, and comments are both consistent and believable. The script is very tight
 "Frozen River" is a really exceptional movie. Director: Sean Penn. Starring: Melissa Leo and Ray Winstone. I found this movie to be a great one. It's one of those movies that you will watch again and again. And again. It is well worth the time and money to go see it. It is a very good story. It is about a young woman's journey to get her daughters back. It is a very good movie, full of suspense and great acting. I would give this movie a 9 out of 10.

"Frozen River" is about a young woman (Melissa Leo) who has to drive a car for a drug dealer. She has to drive a long trip to pick up drugs from a place in Canada. She gets a call from her boyfriend to pick up her daughter from the place where the drugs are being picked up. But the location is frozen, because of the cold weather. So the daughter is left in the car for the night. The daughter and the driver have to get out of the car and walk across a frozen river to Canada. They have to skirt the border, and other obstacles before they can get to the Canadian side. They get out of the car
 I liked this movie. It was a fun and funny movie. I am sure it is not for everyone, but I liked it. There were some funny parts, but some things were just a little off. I think it was the setting in Texas. I am sure there are things that were not right in Texas, but this was a funny movie. I give it a 7 out of 10.

If you are a football fan then you will love this movie. It's about a local high school football team. There is a new coach, the school is in trouble and the players have to make a decision and grow as a team and individuals. Danny Glover stars as the coach who must pull his team together and get them ready to play ball. The rest of the cast are amazing. They are all good looking and play very well together. The story is well written and funny. The actors, who play their roles well, are not your typical actors. They play
 I saw this movie today and it made me think of so many things. First of all, I loved the story which was in a way of a semi-fantasy. The story is quite similar to Game of Thrones and the like, with a lot of twists and turns. I think the story was very well done and I loved that there was a lot of action and lots of CGI. For me, what made this movie so special was the cast. I think the cast was perfect, especially the main character. The actors were very talented and I loved that there were so many different characters. My favorite character was the main character and I really liked the way he acted. I think this movie was very well done, I just hope people can't get the idea that this is a documentary. I think it was very well done and I totally recommend this movie.

 This is the first time I've seen this movie and I must say it's not bad at all. I think the story is good and the characters are believable but the acting isn't really that good. I'm a big fan of horror films and this is one of the better ones I've seen. The atmosphere is great and it's actually really scary. You can really feel the fear of the victims and their desperation. The monster design is cool, especially the chainsaw thing he throws at the victims. The camera work is pretty good, though you do sometimes see the monster's shadow. The soundtrack is good too, and the movie has a great ending. It's cool to see an all-black cast in a horror film.

6/10

Watch it if you want to see a good horror movie. I think it's worth it.

 I haven't watched this film for many years, but I remember watching it with my friend and his parents, who I had visited briefly when I was 12 in London. We watched the film on a tiny TV that was attached to the back of a piano, and I remember it being so beautiful, and having such a powerful effect on me.<br /><br />I loved the film and I recently came across the soundtrack and bought it. I was utterly amazed by the music and the power of the film, and I was even more amazed at the discovery of how much I had remembered about the film. I even remembered the actual framing of the film and where I sat on the sofa - which I couldn't recall!<br /><br />Such a wonderful film that I am so glad I found again! So glad I didn't lose it!!

5.0 out of 5 stars The soundtrack for my life! Format: Audio CD I first saw this film in London in the mid 1990's, and I have never forgotten it. It is one of the few films I have seen more than once, and I have always wanted to get my hands on the soundtrack. I have never seen the film again, but I have bought
 This is the most interesting film I've ever seen. It's the story of how a young woman, who has a crush on her uncle, is accepted into a local amateur theatre group, only to discover that the characters in the play she's in, "Cinderella" are actually living and breathing people. And the people in the play are very, very unhappy about it. It's also about being true to yourself and not letting anyone else tell you who you are. It's not very often that a film does so much with so little. It's a beautiful film.

A bad film with a great cast

I have to say that this is a very bad film. It's a drama with some humor and some romance. But the acting is terrible and it's just a bad film with a great cast.

I got the feeling that this film was made by a group of people who don't know how to make a film. They don't know how to edit it and they don't know how to structure it. The story is very confusing and disjointed. There is no flow to it. The characters are all very one dimensional. And the script is

 I have seen this movie years ago and I thought that it was a good movie. After I saw it again last night I realized that it was even better than I remembered.<br /><br />I think I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about the supernatural. I think that about 2/3 of the movie is about the horrible things that Sam is going through but the other 1/3 is about Sam and why he was so nice. Sam is a nice person and he is not a villain. He is just a guy who has his problems.<br /><br />I think that the reason that Sam was so nice was because his family was so nice to him. I think that if Sam had had any other family he would have been just like one of the other people in the movie.

(spoiler)Sam's dad is a drunk and his mom is a whore. (spoiler)Sam's mom died when he was little. (spoiler)Sam's dad abused him.<br /><br />I think that when Sam's dad is drunk he hits Sam. I think he also hits Sam's mom.<br /><br />I think that when Sam's mom was alive she would have
 The central character of this movie is the classic Brit character of the bumbling fool. The movie is based on a book by one of England's best-loved authors, Terry Pratchett.<br /><br />Sir Terry Pratchett has written several great comic novels and his novels Discworld have won several awards in Britain and America. In this movie we see the character of Rincewind, a bumbling wizard who is constantly trying to escape from the book. This movie is an hilarious comedy and is more than worth watching. The movie is also one of the most successful British comedies of its time. <br /><br />The movie was very well received by both critics and the public. It was a box office success taking nearly $60 million in the U.S. and $24 million in Canada. The movie was also nominated for several British awards. <br /><br />The movie was very well cast. The central character is played by Sean Connery. Sean Connery is a well-known actor. He is well-known for his role as James Bond. He is very funny in this movie as he plays the role of the bumbling wizard Rincewind. The movie also stars: David
 I liked this film quite a bit. It is a pretty good story and well acted. I think it will appeal to the audience that likes 1408. It has some of the same themes and some of the same things. I think that it may strike a cord with some people. The only thing I can see that people will complain about is the lack of a monster. I think that the story is strong enough that if the film makers had not decided to make it a ghost story, it would have been a good film. I am not a big fan of ghosts or haunted house stories. I like the story that was told here. I think it was done very well. I found the acting to be very good. The only thing that I think is missing is the monster. I can understand that the people who love this genre may have been disappointed that there was no monster. But I think that the story was enough to warrant a good film. I think that it was a good film that has the potential to be a good film. I think that it will be interesting to see what other movies are made in this genre. I think that it is a film that will appeal to a large audience. I think that if people can get past
 It's a shame that it's a bit hard to find this movie on DVD, but it is well worth the effort. This is a very good, very well made movie. The acting is excellent, and the script is very well done. The film tells the story of a family of 10 year-old boys and their daily lives. It shows how they deal with their parents' breakup, the changes that come with adolescence, and the way boys from their age group deal with their first crush. All of the kids are great actors, and their performances are very believable. The movie looks great, and the sound is like the real thing. This is a very enjoyable movie for all ages, and it's an excellent example of the kind of family movie that is missing from the big screen these days.

 I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of time travel movies. I think that they're usually a bit formulaic and predictable. But I have to admit that the premise of this movie is intriguing. It's a nice change of pace from the usual romantic comedy. The chemistry between the two lead characters is good, and it's easy to see why they would fall in love. The movie has a nice fast pace that keeps you interested. The story is quite believable and it makes you wonder what would really happen if someone like George would fall in love with someone like Tom.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this movie isn't receiving more attention. I think that the chemistry between George and Tom is good, and I think that the movie has a lot of humor. The movie is also a nice break from the usual romantic comedy. I think that it's a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies.

Romance, time travel and comedy all rolled into one movie.

Author: Steve Bores from Canada

 I saw this movie at a drive-in and I remember thinking how silly it looked, but I was so eager to see the movie that I didn't want to leave. It's a silly movie, with a silly plot, but it's fun. And it's got a couple of really good laughs (like how the old woman thinks she's being held prisoner by the same guy who's holding her husband captive) and a few good lines that you'll be quoting for the rest of your life. The best thing about this movie is the fact that it's a bit of a satire of the movie business. If a movie is made by a woman, it's automatically awful. If a movie is made by a man, it's automatically great. If a movie is made by a group of guys, it's automatically awful. And if a movie is made by a bunch of women, well, it's automatically great. This movie touches on many of the silly things that happen in the movie business, but it doesn't take any sides. The movie is very refreshing in that way. But it's also very entertaining.

He plans to do this but first he will have to kill the guy first. If you like the genre you will like this movie. I give it a 10 out of 10.

 This movie is a real hidden gem. On one hand it's a very simple love story, and on the other hand it's a rather subtle commentary on the sometimes very moralistic attitude of the director's family. The movie has some very touching moments and it does not get boring at any point. The movie also has some very beautiful shots, like the one of the lake at the beginning of the movie, or the scene where the two main characters are driving back from the lake. In the end, I must say that I liked the movie a lot. I was challenged by the movie, and I was quite surprised by the ending. This is a very good movie, definitely not the best this director has ever done, but definitely a very good one.

*** THE BAD: The story is pretty much a re-hash of the original. The character of Kevin (from the original film) is NOT in this film, and the "new" character of James (played by Charles Dance, who played Tywin Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones) doesn't do much in the film. They actually gave him a bigger role in the film, with him being the guy who is the villian, but they wasted it. Kevin was a pretty big part of the original, and so I was disappointed when he was not in this film. Also, the ending was ridiculous. After the "monster" shows up, and a bunch of
 This movie is about a guy who is a loser. He's a loser because he's a fat-ass who doesn't have a job, is a slob and has no social life. One day, he's walking around the city when he runs into a really hot chick. She gives him her number and tells him to call her when he's ready. After several months, he calls her and follows her home. He tells her that he wants to make a change in his life and asks her to be his girlfriend. She agrees. Then he goes to her apartment to see how she lives. What he discovers is that she's a professional stripper. He's impressed with her body, so he decides to give it a try. She agrees and they have a lot of fun together. They do it all and they're very good at it. After a while, he decides that he wants to try something different, so he goes back to what he knows and becomes a dancer. We see him in the clubs and we see him with his girlfriend. He sees his ex-girlfriend and she's still doing the same thing that he's doing. After a while, she decides that she wants to become a stripper too, so he
 This film is a masterpiece in the interpretation of human relationships.<br /><br />I remember the time very well, I was a teenager, when my father discovered this film, and was absolutely astonished. He was so moved by it, that he actually went and got the VHS tape of the film which I had seen. He watched the whole film straight through, and when he finished the tape, he handed it back to me, saying "Son, I will never forget the first time I saw this film".<br /><br />I myself, watched it a number of times, and can still watch it, and it always moves me.<br /><br />This is a perfect film for all ages, and for every person, for all time.

It is about a girl named Sophie (played by Tippi Hedren) that goes to a party with her boyfriend (played by Rod Taylor) and meets a guy named Dr. Sam (played by Edmond O'Brien). She falls in love with him, but he doesn't return her feelings. He keeps telling her that he's married and that he has a wife and three little children. He also tells her that she's the only woman he wants to see. Meanwhile, Sophie's mother (played by Jessica Tandy) is pregnant again, and she is afraid that if she gives birth in a hospital, it will be the end of her and her husband's marriage.<br /><br />This movie is about a lot of different issues, some of which we still don't understand today. For example, we go to a hospital to give birth, but we don't realize that the doctor can't force us to go, so why do we go? We are afraid of letting others know that we are pregnant and we are afraid of the pain of giving birth. We also don't realize that the doctor can't force us
 I saw this movie in the theaters, and while I was struck by the movie's visual style, I was disappointed with the storyline. I was really hoping for something a little more exciting and twisting, as the plot seemed a little dull. It was a nice concept, and I felt like I was watching a movie that was trying to be something it wasn't. I was hoping for a little more grit and grit, but I felt like I was watching a pretty straight forward movie with a few interesting twists. I've seen this movie a few times now, and it really doesn't hold up well. I think that once you have seen it a few times, it's apparent that the ending is not plausible. It is average at best, and I just can't recommend it. I recently saw "Saving Private Ryan", and I felt that the style of that movie was much better.

 I saw this movie at the Texas Film Festival in Austin and it completely blew me away. The movie could have easily been titled "The Unholy Trinity" since it includes all that is evil, dangerous, and psychotic. The movie takes place in a small Italian town, only a few weeks after the death of a priest during a sermon. The town has been left in a state of terror by the events that transpired on that day, and the priest's assassin is still on the loose. The sheriff is sent to investigate the case, and quickly begins to suspect that the crime was no ordinary murder. However, he has no proof, and as he starts to investigate the case, he discovers that he has been set up by a few prominent members of the town. The entire town has been played by the same person, and the plot gets more and more twisted as it progresses. As the sheriff begins to unravel the plot, he finds that his life is in danger, and he has to rely on the help of a local prostitute, and a mysterious stranger, in order to discover the truth. The acting is superb, and the plot is twisted and dangerous, keeping the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. I would highly recommend this movie
 I had never read a book by Dennis Lehane until a few months ago. The book was "Gone Baby Gone." I had seen the movie before, but this was my first time reading the book. I found out from my sister that the book was very different from the movie. I was a little disappointed when I found this out, because I was looking for the same kind of story as the movie. But, that was not the case. The story was very different. I loved this book. It took me a long time to read it, because I did not want it to end. It was very hard to put down. I loved the character development throughout the book. I really felt that I knew these characters. The plot was crazy, and had a lot of twists and turns. I really liked the way it was written. The characters really felt alive to me. I really liked the way the author weaved the story together. I liked the way the characters drew me in, and I could not wait to see what would happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good thriller.

 I'm not a fan of horror movies and this is not a horror movie. It's a thriller, yes, and a suspenseful thriller at that. It doesn't go over the top in the gore department and the plot is quite simple. It's not very "original" but it is a very well-made film, directed by Gaspar Noé and starring great actors like Juliette Binoche, Chloë Sevigny, Vincent Cassel and Vincent Gallo. The film is about Léa Seydoux and Binoche who both play two sisters (and identical twins) who are disturbed by the sudden and unexpected death of their mother. The movie starts with a flashback to the day of the death of their mother and you get to see the siblings grow up, getting involved in drugs and fights, etc. It's not a happy family and the two sisters, who have never been particularly close, aren't very close now, either. They are suspicious of each other and they don't like each other very much, either. They hate their father, a man they never really knew, and they are very protective of their little brother, who has a speech impediment and who is, in many ways, a blank slate
 This is an excellent film. I wish there were more like it. It is a beautiful study of two people who are facing death, both of whom have witnessed the death of other people. Both come to the point that they are facing death and understand that this is a part of life. It was very moving and beautiful. I would recommend it to anyone.

The plot of the film is what makes this movie so special. It is a story of a couple who are facing death, but with a twist -- the death is not of their choice. They have to deal with the death of someone close to them, a loved one, who was taken away from them in the most tragic of ways. The film is about the way this couple deals with the death of the loved one. The way they each respond to the death of their loved one is unique and touching. The two people are quite different and yet they are both very much alike. The way the director dealt with this was very original and made the film more moving and poignant.

The acting was superb. I don't know enough of the actors in this film to say, but they are both very skilled. The actresses were great and the actors were outstanding. The two
 This is a great movie about a woman who gets the chance to be on a TV show, but she finds out that the people who are on the show really aren't famous and she has to decide if she wants to leave or stay. The movie is a little slow but it's very entertaining. I really enjoyed it. There is nothing in it that will make you offended or anything, it's just a fun movie. It's a little bit of a change from the other movies you see all the time, it's good to see something different once in a while.

 I have been a fan of the movies of Jean-Claude Van Damme since I first saw him in Timecop. I found it ironic that a man who seemed to have so much trouble with his martial arts skills, turned out to be a much better actor. I have seen his movies since and have been a fan of his acting style. I have seen him in movies like Timecop 2 and Double Impact. I have to say that I was not overly impressed with JCVD's acting in this movie. I agree that this is not the best movie that he has done, but I thought that he did a pretty good job. I thought that he played his part as Van Damme well. He did not really play himself as JCVD, but that is understandable because JCVD is not really a person. JCVD is a symbol. In this movie he plays the part of the symbol of the name-brand company. He plays the part well and I think that he did a good job. I thought that the role was very small, but it was one of the most interesting parts of the movie. I was also very surprised that he was not wearing a wig when he played the role of Van Damme. He looks very much
 You know how you are always hearing about the greatest movies and how they are the best? Well, The French Connection is a perfect example of that. The New York city police department has been trying for years to catch a drug lord by the name of Frank "Popeye" Marino, who is using the docks to get his merchandise from Colombia to New York. When the police department gets a tip from a corrupt cop, the case goes from a simple drug bust to a full scale war between the police department and the drug lord. The movie is so intense and full of action and suspense that there are so many times that you are on the edge of your seat. The tension and excitement never let up until the very end. The movie is based on a true story and it shows the gritty and violent reality of police procedure and how much blood and sweat it takes to get the job done. This is a movie that every movie buff should see.

 I am a big fan of this film, "The Wild One" and the other film that inspired it, the original "Rebel Without A Cause." I think this is a very good film, especially for 1950. It is a great film and a classic. I would give it a 10 out of 10.

A Classic that Never Gets Old

Author: oeiee from United States

5 May 2016

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I'm not sure if it's because I'm a child of the sixties, but "The Wild One" has never left my mind. Despite my age, I'm a big fan of the film, and I own the soundtrack. This is one of the few films that holds up even today, and I still watch it every now and then. The acting is superb, especially Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin, who played brothers. The film is about a motorcycle gang, which is memorable for being the first film to show an extended scene of a motorcycle gang, with not one but two scenes of bikers riding side by side!
 This movie is about a family that spends most of their time together and it's not a happy one. The father (Henry Jones) is a lawyer who is a very demanding man. He is honest and a realist, but he is also overbearing. The mother (Judy Davis) is a loving and kind woman. The daughter is a quiet and nice person (Sarah Jessica Parker). The son is an over-the-top punk who is frustrated with life and his parents. The brother is a quiet anti-social person with a bit of a mental problem. The sister is a nice girl who has a crush on a boy in her class. The family has a dog named Max and he accompanies them on their various adventures. The first half of the movie is quite funny, but towards the end the mood becomes darker and darker. The movie is well made and the acting is very good, the script is very well written, and the cinematography is excellent. There are many laughs, but it is also quite sad and disturbing at times. My favorite scene is when the father and son are making fun of each other. I recommend this movie for all ages.

 This is a great movie for all ages, I have 2 young children and they love it. They have watched it over and over again and have even started to learn the songs and dance moves. I have watched this movie hundreds of times and get so excited every time I see it. I have also watched this movie with my husband and he loves it too. We have watched it together so many times that it is now our favorite movie to watch. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.

My kids love this movie! When I first purchased it, I was worried that they wouldn't be interested in it because we already had so many other kid's movies. But they love it! They want to watch it over and over again. They even started learning the dances and singing the songs. It is a great movie for all ages. Don't let your kids miss out on this great film.

 This movie is one of the best in the genre. It's got everything a horror movie should have. The story is simple. A group of friends go camping and one by one, one of them goes home. Soon it becomes apparent that the one who stayed behind is the killer. The movie is gory and creepy. The lighting, the music, and the cinematography make this movie a great one.

 It's been years since I've seen "The People vs. Larry Flynt". I've never read the book, but I've always been curious to see how the story would translate to film, so I rented it recently. Well, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a very pretentious, self-righteous, and preachy "documentary" on the evils of pornography and the hypocritical hypocrisy of the adult film industry. I wasn't expecting a tongue-in-cheek, "Back To The Future" spoof.<br /><br />The film has one of the most twisted plot lines I've ever heard. Larry Flynt, played by Woody Harrelson, is a ruthless, manipulative, self-righteous, and evil pornographer. He's also a genius. He's played by Harrelson (and the voice of his lawyer, Mickey) perfectly. The fact that he's a genius is the only thing that's believable in the film. Everything else is just so over the top and unbelievable. This is clearly the biggest flaw in the film. I mean, who really believes that Larry Flynt is a genius? The movie would have been a lot more believable if it wasn't for the
 I just watched this movie for the first time tonight. I have to say, it was a pretty good movie. The acting was pretty good, and the story was pretty good. I would have to say it was better than the original. I will probably watch it again, but I don't think I will watch it more than once. There's just not enough to it to make it worth watching more than once. I would recommend it, but only for someone that has seen the original or read the book. If you have read the book, then it's a pretty good movie. If you don't know anything about the story, then it's a pretty good movie. I give it a 7 out of 10.

I haven't seen this film in ages, but I remember it being a very good movie. I remember it very much like a book, so I'm not sure why I didn't give it a good review then, but I suppose I was more impressed by the
 On a tiny, remote island off the coast of the Philippines, the children of a priest play a game of hide-and-seek. They don't know it, but there is a sinister presence in the woods, waiting for the children to find it. The film, which was filmed in the Philippines and has a budget of $10,000, has been called "a found-footage movie for people who don't like found-footage movies."<br /><br />The film is based on a short story that won Raymond Chandler a World Fantasy Award. It's a work of imagination and a little scary, but the best piece of cinema I've seen in the last few years. I think this film is an example of a genre that doesn't get the respect it deserves. Horror and the supernatural are usually handled with a wink or a chuckle, or even with a deep suspicion. This film is scary, but it's not a joke.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. It's a little odd, if not a little ambiguous. But the film succeeds at what it sets out to do: to create a sense of dread and unease. You don't really know where
 Eddie Murphy's first post-Beverly Hills Cop role is a fine example of how to make a movie without being a complete hack. The director, Adam Mazer, used the basic premise to create a great movie. A nice surprise is that Murphy's character is not a wimp. He is a very smart guy. He knows that he's in over his head, but he doesn't give up. Shortly before his death, the character takes on two very determined adversaries, each one a stereotype. The first guy is the typical head of an organized crime family. The second is the muscle, who is really in over his head. The two guys are far from being equal, but the movie doesn't dwell on that. The best thing about the film is the terrific supporting cast, including the great F. Murray Abraham, who plays the villain's psychiatrist. Adam Mazer wrote the screenplay, and he does a great job at creating a realistic and interesting story. Watching the movie is like reading a book. It's a real page-turner. There's no need for a trailer, because the movie is so good, it needs no promotion. If you get a chance to see it, you'll probably enjoy it.


 The thing we like about this film is that it is authentic. It's a realistic depiction of the conditions of the time, and it's not over the top. It's a movie that is easy to connect with. It has a great message, and it's inspiring to see it in a film.

I didn't like how they were portrayed as a bunch of people who were doing it for money, but I don't think that's the way it was. I think it was more like they were being creative and doing something that they loved, and they had to do it to survive. The movie shows people doing things for the love of the art, and doing it because they love the people, not because they want to make a million bucks.

I liked how it didn't preach to the audience. When the movie starts, there are probably a lot of viewers that are thinking, "Well, this is going to be an artsy film that I'm not going to understand, and if I try to understand it, it's going to take me out of the movie." But it doesn't. It is so easy to watch and follow. I loved the way the movie made you see things as they happened, and
 This movie was laugh-out-loud funny. The problem with a lot of movies is that they're so serious, they're not all that funny. This one is the opposite. The situations are so ridiculous, it's impossible not to laugh at them.<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is that there are A LOT of gay jokes and it's not really a very good movie if you don't like gay jokes that are really over-the-top and don't really add to the story.<br /><br />I recommend this movie as a "laugh-out-loud" movie. If you don't like gay jokes, it probably won't be as funny.

 O'Brien brings a freshness to the genre that is rarely seen. The film is extremely fast paced, and the pace never lets up. There are times when the film loses it's energy, but, for the most part, O'Brien keeps the film's energy going at a fast pace throughout the film. I particularly enjoyed the early scenes of the film, but even the more excessive scenes of the film (such as the underwater car chase) kept the film moving at a fast pace. The film is also full of sequences of extreme violence, which O'Brien handles quite well (the scene where the Hitman is stabbed in the head is particularly good). The film is not without it's flaws. For example, the film's attempt to create a "big" ending is a little silly. The film also has a tendency to make it's characters look like they're trying to be cool, and the camera work is often a little awkward. However, the film's problems are only minor and do not detract from the film's overall excellence. The film is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys films that are fast paced, and violence.

 This is one of those films that you can watch over and over again and never tire of it. While not a masterpiece, it is a good, solid, funny film that is well worth the time. The plot can be summed up as this: A young woman who's been given up for adoption by her mother is sent to a girls' home to be "re-educated" by a staff of harridans, who have made her believe that her father is a sexual pervert who will not allow her to have any contact with him. When she finds out her father is not the pervert she was told, she finds herself in a moral dilemma. <br /><br />The film is set in the time of the Great Depression, when a girl's place was in the home. The plot is told in flashback, revealing the girl's story throughout the film. It is well-acted by the entire cast, which includes a big-name star, a well-known veteran of the stage and screen, and a young actress who was also in "The Big Chill." One of the all-time great films, for me.<br /><br />The DVD is a bit dark, and the picture is not as
 I've been watching this series since it started, and I love it. This is the best series on TV right now. I love the characters, and the actors/actresses are amazing.

She's a very strong and powerful woman, and her relationship with her father is amazing. I'm a big fan of David Caruso, and the way they ended the series is perfect.

This movie is so great it's scary! It's so funny and it's so interesting that you don't want to stop watching it. It's got everything: drama, romance, action, mystery, and humor. The acting is amazing and I hope that I can act just like all the actors in this movie. I also love the music and the scenery. I hope that this movie will be nominated for an Oscar. This is the best movie that I ever saw in my entire life.

A Wonderful Movie

 This is a beautiful film. The direction is excellent and the acting is mesmerizing. The movie takes on a dreamlike feel as the characters live in a world that seems unreal and we as the audience are unaware of the reality of the characters' situation. The film is beautifully shot with a very warm, gentle color palette. The use of light and shadow are superb. I especially like the use of a light in the background that is kept very dim while the main characters are talking, which gives the scene a feeling of unreality. Another great feature of the film is the lack of dialogue. The actors are allowed to move and interact just as if they were not speaking. There are no explicit lines that say 'you're beautiful' or 'you're a fool'. Those things are inferred as the characters react to each other. The director makes use of this as a way to show feelings without any dialogue at all. The characters are all very real and authentic. They are not perfect people but neither are they horrible people. They are simply people. And the film shows that very well. The film is about the people who have to live with the aftermath of a terrible tragedy. It is about a man who has to live with the consequences of his
 This is a beautiful story. The characters are strong and believable. The story is moving and the acting is great. I don't usually like the kind of movies that are very slow and sad. But this one is definitely not that. I love the way it all connects. I love the strong women, especially the mother and the sister. The mother is so strong and caring. And I love the sister too. She is such a good friend to her sister. I love all the relationships in this movie. It's a great family movie. I am glad I saw this movie. I am glad I saw this movie because it had a big impact on my life. I think that this movie is a beautiful story.

(This is my first review) I saw this movie on the Lifetime channel. I was actually on the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching this movie.

 This is a terrific little film, and the story is very well told. The cast is excellent, especially John Woodvine as the mean, nasty butler. He is truly frightening in his role, and I never imagined that he was so nice underneath that nasty exterior. I have seen a lot of horror flicks, but I have never seen a film with such great actors as this. The only flaw in the film is the "horror" scenes that are not really scary. I would have preferred a film with the same story, but without the "horrors," but it was still a great film. I give it an 8 out of 10.

TITLE: The House That Dripped Blood

AUTHOR: Gordon Douglas

RATING: 8.0

COMMENTS: The House That Dripped Blood is a very original horror film. This is one that you can watch again and again, and every time you watch it, you will find something new. The film starts out with a very scary scene, and it keeps you guessing throughout the entire film, so you never know what is going to happen next. The cast is excellent, and I think the director did a great
 I was very pleased to see that the producers of this film were so concerned about the truth of the story involved. I had read the book several years ago and was very disappointed that the book was not made into a movie. Being a writer myself, I felt the book should have been made into a movie because it could have been better. The stories told in the book were very detailed and realistic. I felt that the story line of the book was very complex and would have been complicated to transfer to the screen. But I am so glad the producers took the time to research the story and did not try to make changes to make it more appealing to the audience. I applaud them for being true to the story and being willing to wait for the right time to bring this movie to the public.

I have also seen the movie and I did not feel that they changed the story as much as I thought. They did not change the story that much and I think that is what made the movie more believable and made the movie better. The acting was also very good in this movie. I felt that the actors were very believable in their roles and the acting made the movie better.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who has read the
 I saw this movie in its original version back in the early 90's on HBO. I remember that I was glued to the screen from start to finish. The acting was nothing short of brilliant, the story was gripping, and the direction was extremely well done. I remember that this movie was nominated for at least 5 different awards. I am not sure who won them all, but I am certain that this movie deserved it all. I am hoping that when it comes out on DVD, it will be in the best possible quality. I hope that someone, somewhere will make this movie available to the general public. This is a movie that anyone would enjoy, no matter what age they are. I hope that it gets a DVD release, and I hope that it will be shown on TV. I hope that it is shown on AMC and that it is in the rotation, because this movie is just too good to be left to obscurity.

Drawing on a rich tradition of American film noir, The Player is one of those rare films that is just as relevant now as it was back in 1989. A twenty-something writer (Tim Robbins) is disillusioned with his career,
 I would like to start by saying that i am a massive fan of the show and always have been. I have been a fan for about 4 years and can honestly say that i have never once been disappointed by a single episode. I have watched the show from start to finish every week for the last 4 years and i have never once been bored. I have seen the DVD's which have been released throughout the years and i have watched them to death. I think that the show has taken a massive step up in quality over the last few years and i am truly proud to be a fan of the show. I think that the show really started to improve and in my opinion began to become the best show on television when the introduction of the long-lost brother was introduced. I think that the show continues to be on a steady rise and i think that it will only get better and better in the future. I am so pleased that the show exists and i am so pleased that i am a fan of it! The show is amazing and i am proud to be a fan of it! The quality of the show has literally taken a massive step up in the last few years and i think that the quality will continue to go up. I would definitely
 This movie is awesome. It has a great plot, great acting, great music, and great special effects.<br /><br />If you like to see a movie that will make you laugh, get this movie. The movie is about a young boy who has to go on a quest to save his dad's life. The boy's name is Jack and his dad's name is Sam.

His memory is kind of messed up but he is still able to figure stuff out. Jack has to go on a quest to save his dad's life. He has to go on
 This movie is a perfect example of how to make a comedy that's not afraid to be funny. It is a comedy of manners, which are the basis of all comedy. The movie makes fun of the absurdities of the upper class in America. This is a movie that makes fun of people who are too good to be true and too bad to be true. In short, it's a movie that you should see if you're a sucker for the absurd.

7/10

I don't know what it is, but I seem to have a special fondness for the movies of Robert Altman. This movie, like Short Cuts and The Player, have so much depth that they can be seen as a small masterpiece.

This movie is a comedy of manners, which is a comedy of all comedy. The movie is about manners and the absurdities of the upper class in America. The movie is also about the absurdities of the upper class, which are absurdities of all upper classes. The movie is about the absurdities of being too different from one's peers, and the absurdities of being too perfect. The movie is about the absurdities of being too much of one thing and too little of another
 I love this movie and the cast is great, especially the talented Juliette Lewis and the wonderful Timothy Hutton. I have seen the movie many times, but I always enjoy it even more when I see it again. I highly recommend this movie to someone who loves a good mystery and/or a good mystery romance.

I am always surprised when people comment on this movie or judge it by the trailer and not by the movie itself. I always love to see actors and actresses who have not been in a lot of movies before and are willing to take a chance on this new role in their careers. Juliette Lewis is a wonderful actress and I hope she gets more opportunities like this to try new things and to grow as an actress.

I also love to hear other people's comments on this movie when they see it. I read the comments on this movie and they are always very helpful and I always learn something new and interesting. I like to know what others think of this movie too. I hope everyone enjoys this movie and I hope they will leave comments on it and review it.

This movie is one of my favorites and it is a great watch that I highly recommend to anyone who loves a good mystery.


 I was a bit hesitant to see this film as I'm not very big on horror/sci-fi films. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was actually very scary. It was a lot scarier than the first installment. I think the director did a great job of lining up the scares. The film was also very well made. The sets were realistic, and the special effects were great as well. I think the acting was also very good. The only real thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending, but for such a low budget film, I think it was a good one. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys horror/sci-fi films.

Fantastic Four - Rated R

I was actually a little disapointed to see the Fantastic Four movie. It was a little too much like the first one. The special effects were only passable at best. There were a few moments where the special effects were a little cheesy, but i don't think they were any worse than the first one. The movie was a little choppy at times, and the pacing was all over
 I suppose the only reason why I didn't give this movie a 10 was because of the bad acting. I mean, I can forgive the actors for this. It's not their fault that their characters were so bland, especially for a movie about God and religion. This movie could almost be a documentary. It is mostly about God, and the people who talk about God. And it's not that religious. It's more of a social thing. And that's all. So, I guess it was just all right. I also think that the movie, as a whole, was quite boring. It was just a very slow, boring movie. But, I loved the end. And I loved the way the movie started, with the old man talking about religion and God. I felt that the beginning was very interesting, and the end made up for all the boring parts. Not bad, not great, but not bad. I think that this movie has the potential to be great. The ending was definitely the best part.

WOW! I really didn't expect to be so enthralled by this movie. I thought it would be boring and stupid
 The movie was very good. I did not know much about the story of the movie but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The acting was excellent and the historical information was fascinating. I was very impressed with the documentary footage of the event and I found it hard to believe that it all happened. The movie contained a lot of humor and heart. It was very moving and I was surprised at how much I loved it. I would definitely recommend it, but I would also recommend reading the book. It is a good book and I think it is better than the movie. I was very happy that I was able to see the movie and that I was able to learn more about this event. I think it is a very important part of history.

I would rate this movie as an 8 because I found it to be very good and I loved it.

The movie is very good. I was not sure what to expect but I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical dramas. The acting was excellent, the story was interesting, and the historical information was fascinating. I was very impressed with the documentary footage
 I have a way of describing this film. It is like a "throwback" to the 80's action films. It's as if they had a zillion dollars to make the film and they used it to make a film that is a love letter to action films. The effects are amazing and the cast is great. It's the best type of movie to just sit back and watch. It is the type of film that the director and writers have made the right choice in making it. It is the type that doesn't take itself too seriously and it's a film that you can watch with the family. It's a fun film that you can watch again and again when you're in the mood for a fun action film.

A lot of fun to be had in this film that you'll be happy you saw it. I would recommend this film to anyone.

 "Blind Date" is a very light and comical action-romance. A man who is blind buys a television set, and unknowingly matches with a woman who is a cop.<br /><br />The chemistry between Minnie Driver and Matthew Perry is definitely there. Their characters are one of a kind. Even though the two of them are so different, they end up falling into the same groove. The film is fast-paced and very funny. The action scenes are great, and the comedy scenes are pretty good too.<br /><br />There are just a few flaws. The ending has a really corny twist, and the film is a little too predictable. But it's worth watching.<br /><br />Final Rating: *** out of *****.

 Here's a movie I never really saw coming - but definitely wanted to see. It's based on a book written by a long time friend of mine and I think he sums up the movie quite well when he says, "It's about a guy who does his job, comes home, and goes to bed. It is exactly what it's about. Or, it's about a guy who does his job and he's been doing it for six months straight. He's been working out of his head and his heart. He's been working day and night to get the job done. He's at a certain point in his job. He knows what he's doing and what he's supposed to do. Then he goes to his home, his wife, his kids and his dog. And he finally gets to be a family man. Then he goes to bed." That's pretty much how the movie is. It does have some strong performances and a definite message. And it's not a "boy meets girl" movie, but you'll come out of it with a new perspective on life.

3 out of 4 stars.

 This is another film that I cannot think of a review for. I like to watch it again and again. The story is as clear as a bell. The acting is very good and the music is lovely. It is set in the 1800's and is all about the two women who are working on their farms, and their very different relationship. It is a very simple story, but very moving. I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good story and likes to be moved.

A beautiful story

Author: mike-in-sweden from Sweden

An excellent film with a clear story and beautiful music (one of my favorite movie scores). I was very impressed by the director's skill to make a film a bit more complicated by allocating the characters in such a way to create a film that is not just about the two women but also about the men. I also liked the actors and their natural performances, as well as the very beautiful music.

 This movie is absolutely fantastic. From the first word, it's a totally unpredictable story. I can't help but think that this movie is a modern day version of a Hitchcock thriller. I hope someone makes a sequel.

jim carrey plays a slippery, manipulative, psycho killer. He's a brilliant character, who looks like he's the devil. The way he's played is just amazing. He oozes evil. The way he gets the girl, and the way he talks with the killer and then the killer himself are all very interesting.

The killer is played by the very talented, and scary, bruce willis. He's truly a phenomenal actor. His performance as the killer, is brilliant as well. He's very creepy, and really gets into the role of the killer. He makes the character seem like a real person. He is truly a brilliant actor.

The movie is very well put together, and the music and the sound effects are amazing. The story flows very smoothly, and the ending is brilliant. I love how the movie doesn't have a predictable ending. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again, and still keep your interest. It's truly a great movie
 I watched this film as a youngster, and it is still one of my favorites today. I enjoy the storyline, the characters, and the twists and turns of the story. It is a very good mystery film. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies.

 I can't put my finger on exactly why, but I find the story of this movie so uplifting, I feel it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's not just a movie about survival in the wilderness, it's a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. There are plenty of characters in this movie who aren't exactly likeable and who seem to have no moral compass, but that's the point. A movie about survival in the wilderness shouldn't be about just a few survivors as the story unfolds, but about the many people who try to help the survivors, but are unable to. It's about the many people who try to help the people who were left behind, but are unable to. In the end, it's about the people who are able to help others, and the people who are not. When the movie ended, I felt as though I'd learned something about the human spirit, and about the importance of helping others. I think everyone should watch this movie, no matter what your age or interest level. It's not just a survival movie. It's a movie about the triumph of the human spirit.

It's not a film that will change you or make you think, but it is a film that will make you feel, and that's what film is supposed to do.

Sleepless in Seattle (1993) A good romantic comedy. 15 June 2004 - 2 out of 2 users found this review helpful
 Just a few notes, since I read quite a lot on this film. First, this is not your average gore-fest with full frontal nudity, blood and guts. This is an art film with a lot of depth and meaning. It is not just a blood and guts film with a message. Secondly, this is not your typical film where the woman is the antagonist. There is some character development, and the main character is not an evil person. Thirdly, the film is extremely well acted. And fourth, I have to say that this film is quite entertaining. It is not a film that you watch to see the gore, but rather a film that you watch because you enjoy it. I enjoyed this film and I think it deserves 10/10.

 I'm not going to pretend to know what the Bible is all about but I do know that there are many, many versions of it. In the beginning God created the world, light and night, the firmament and the stars, the plants and the animals, the mountains and the seas, the sky and the earth. He created man in his own image, male and female, and the Lord God made them one flesh. The Lord God planted a garden in Eden and placed there the man, Adam, to till it and care for it. And from the ground the Lord God made to grow every kind of tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food. The Lord God gave to adam and to his wife, eve, each a form of an animal and gave them to eat of the tree of life that was in the midst of the garden, and he said don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die. And adam and eve had children and they became very big and strong, in fact, too strong for the Lord God to keep them in the garden of eden. So the Lord God sent his one and only Son, Jesus Christ
 Let me first say that I am not a "movie buff" by any means. I am a Harry Potter fan (both the book and movie) and I have seen some of the better movies (so far). I have seen the big budget movies like LOTR and LOTR:The Return of the King, but I have also seen the smaller movies like Pan's Labyrinth. I recently got bored and decided to watch this movie after hearing so many good things about it.<br /><br />I was impressed by the idea of the movie. A story that we could read in one book, but put on film would be a great idea. Sadly, this movie is NOTHING like the book. It's much different in a few ways, but overall it is not as good. The movie is not as dramatic and it does not have the same over-all feel of the book. I don't know why the actors failed to bring the characters in the book to life on the screen. I'm not sure if the director was just not able to deliver on the book, or if the actors just weren't up to the task. Somewhere in the middle of the movie I began to feel bored and restless. I was enjoying the movie
 The movie is about an American science teacher who, to prove that evolution is a fact, creates a large, genetically-engineered human-chimpanzee hybrid. It's a very entertaining movie with a great story, great characters, and great music. The acting is all good, keeping the movie very entertaining. Downside: the movie is a little bit violent at times, but that's just part of the movie. The best parts of this movie are the music and the story. If you want a good movie to watch, then you should definitely check this one out.

 'The Godfather' is one of the most memorable films ever made. As a film lover, this was one of the films I had to see. It is a masterpiece, and it is one of the only films that could go on to fill your heart with sorrow. It is such a shame that it was not that good a film. It is a remake of the book by Mario Puzo, and it is one of the only books that I find myself reading the second time. The whole movie is based on the book. I have never read the book, but I do know that the book is better than the movie. The movie must have been so hard to film, because it is almost impossible to follow. The book is much more straightforward, and there is much more detail to the movie. But when you look at the movie in comparison to the book, it is almost as though the movie does not even deserve to be called a film. I have never seen a movie that has so many characters that you can not keep track of them. There are so many names, and the whole film is just a bunch of people talking. I know that the book is very detailed, but it is almost as though the book and the

 This movie was very interesting to watch when I first saw it at the theatre and I felt that I was watching something very different from what I'd usually watch. It was a sad story, but I think it deserves a lot more attention than it has been given. My favourite scene is when the interviewer tells his story and the way he talks to the camera and the way he tells the story of his life - it's very touching. The movie is full of emotion and a great deal of precision. It's not as depressing as people say, there are moments of optimism and hope. The acting is very good, especially the characters of the mother and the daughter. They are very realistic. The movie is a great experience and I think everyone should see it.

I found the movie very odd and I'm not sure why. I think it was because it was so realistic and it's a very strange movie. It's not like other movies I've seen in the past. It's not like any movies I've ever seen. It's a very emotional movie, but in a different way than other movies I've seen. The acting is also very good,
 This is a great movie, with a good pace, a good story, and good acting. The movie is about a family who are trapped in the house, when all of a sudden, a killer stalks them, and they have to find a way to escape alive. The setting is a creepy house, that has all the weirdness, and horror, you could ever want.<br /><br />The acting is very good, especially from Lisa Wilcox. She plays the mother, who is also the killer, and she does a great job. The other actors also do a great job, and the story keeps you interested, and engaged, for the entire movie.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves slasher films.

 OK, the acting is not Oscar winning stuff, but it's not enough to keep the movie from being good. The story hits all the right notes, the music is just right, the cinematography is excellent, and the acting is actually pretty good. I am not an expert on the subject, but I don't think this is a very good film. It's maybe an 8 or 9 out of 10. I'm giving it an 8. It's not great, but it's not bad. I think it was the right choice to make. It's not an important movie. It's not a big event. It's just a good movie. I can understand the complaints about the sound quality. I don't think it's that bad. It's not perfect, but I didn't seem to notice any problems. The sound quality is better than some of the other films on the subject I have seen. That's what I think. I can't comment on the rest of it.

 I'm a huge fan of the original "The Phantom of the Opera." The Broadway musical has a fantastic story, amazing set, and amazing music. This film is a new version of the musical and it's quite good. The film version is a bit different from the stage version. The story is basically the same, but the musical is a lot more fast paced and the songs are shorter. The film does not have the most amazing songs, but it does have some great ones. The music is really good and the movie is very visual. The movie is also very good in the acting department. The cast is really good and they really do a great job with this film. The film has very good special effects, but they're not as good as the stage show. The film has great cinematography and it's done very well. The film is a great film, but it's not as good as the stage show. I think that the play is way better, but I do think that the movie is good. I would recommend this film, but I would not recommend the stage show. I would rate this film 8 out of 10.

 I love this movie! It's the first time I've ever really seen a movie that really made me laugh out loud and all kinds of goofy. I love it.

The acting was fantastic, especially by Matt Dillon as Bobby. I love his acting and he did a great job, as did the rest of the cast.

I love Mandy Moore and I love The O.C. and if you like one of those, you'll like this movie too!

My 9 year old daughter loves it too! I think she's attracted to Matt because he's a hottie, but I think she's also drawn to the humor in the movie.

I loved the fact that they didn't show the car accident in the movie. I've heard so many stories about people dying because of a car accident and I was glad that they didn't put that in the movie. I was also glad that they mentioned that Bobby wasn't a bad person like important people thought he was. I think that's a good lesson for all of us to remember.

I love how Bobby tries to explain to his mom that he's not going to take drugs and he really tries to make her understand, too! That
 This film was quite interesting. I must admit that I wasn't really expecting much when I watched it, but I found it a cute and funny film. The film is quite unique and I think that it's one of the very few films that actually took itself seriously while being a comedy. The plot is quite simple: a girl who is bullied by her classmates in school , falls in love with a boy that she met in the park. They decide to get married and the boy takes her to his home. Things are not looking up though, because there's a lot of hostility between them (both are quite hostile to each other) and the girl's father does not approve of the marriage.<br /><br />The film is quite interesting because the plot is not very common. The idea is actually quite simple, but it doesn't leave the film looking like a simple comedy. The plot is quite unique, and the film features a lot of details and jokes. I really liked the fact that the film used the idea of a school play, because it wasn't a cliche school film. The film was made in 2007, but it still feels a bit old, mostly because of the expected storyline. I liked the fact that the film was
 i wasn't sure what to expect when i saw this film. i expected to be bored out of my mind, but somehow i was kept interested throughout the film. i think it was the fact that i knew nothing about the story, except that it was based on a true story. when i read the synopsis i was expecting a movie about a crazy serial killer who takes his victims home and murders them, not the emotional story of a young girl who is sexually abused and how she eventually overcomes her demons. the script was great, and the casting was perfect. i think it is an excellent movie to bring to a movie night, especially for those who have experienced sexual abuse. i would definitely recommend this movie, and i am sure my friends will enjoy it as well.

the film was about a young girl named darlene, who is sexually abused by her father for 5 years. she is also very scared and has never had a boyfriend. when she finally gets a boyfriend, he ends up being in a motorcycle gang and gets her into trouble with the police. she goes to live with her aunt, where she meets her cousin, and they become close. the
 Am I the only one who thinks that this movie is the BEST EVER! Like the other reviewer I was a little hesitant to watch this movie because I was afraid that it would be a waste of time. I am so glad that I watched it! The acting is great, and the story line is very intriguing. There is nothing better than watching a movie that you get sucked into and you can't wait to see what happens next. It is a very good mystery, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I thought that the ending was a little bit of a let down, but it's still worth watching, and I hope that there will be a sequel.

5.0 out of 5 stars Wow. What an intense movie, you'll never forget it. 2 thumbs up.

I've read mixed reviews about this movie and I'm not sure why. I thought it was awesome. I think it's better than the first one. The acting is great, the story is intriguing. I thought the ending was better, but I'm not sure why. I don't know if they really left it open, or if they wanted to make a sequel. I hope that they do, but I'm not
 Honestly, I didn't know much about the film going into it, so I can't say I had high expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised, as the film was a good and entertaining watch. The story is relatively simple, but what makes the film so captivating is the character development. Each character has a unique personality and colorful background. They are very likable and easy to relate to.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that the film took place in the present with the main character (Chris) recalling his former life in France. The film is set in a small town, and the actors are all French and speak the language. The film is very refreshing because it shows us a different culture, and how that can affect someone, who has never lived in that area or country.<br /><br />The film is interesting and has a good pace. It doesn't drag on when there isn't action or dialogue, and the story moves along nicely. The only complaint I had was with the ending, which I felt was rushed and left a lot of unanswered questions. But, I liked the ending and the fact that it didn't end on a cliffhanger. I feel that this would make a great film to
 Don't know if it is because I'm a very new fan of the band, but the movie seemed a bit odd to me. I think some of the characters were a bit over the top, and I think a lot of the dialogue (especially in the beginning) was a bit of a let down. However, I found myself laughing a few times throughout the movie. The story about a band that is trying to get their own TV show was pretty well done. They used a lot of the band's music and it overall was pretty amusing. I was not a big fan of the actor who played the lead singer. He seemed more like an actor playing a character for the sake of the movie than an actual band member. But overall I enjoyed it and look forward to seeing the rest of the band's movies.

*Note: I'm not a member of the band, I just thought it was a pretty good movie.

8/10

***SPOILERS***

I was a bit disappointed that they didn't actually show the band's TV show. I think that was a pretty cool idea and would have been a pretty nice movie to see. As it was, it was just a bit of a disappointment
 This is a sort of a throwback to before the days of 3-D, when movies were actually filmed with a 2-D camera, instead of the current trend of filming everything in 3-D, then converting it to 2-D. The storyline is sort of a cross between "Aliens" and "Apollo 13", a little bit of "The Right Stuff" thrown in there. The acting is excellent, and the special effects are great. The story itself is not too bad, but really, this one doesn't really reach it's full potential. There are so many things that could have been done to make this one a little better. The biggest problem is the fact that it is only 79 minutes long. Normally, a good movie should be over two hours long, and a movie that is 79 minutes long should be a great movie. This one is just barely a good movie. But, on the other hand, it is kind of cool that they had the guts to try this one in a limited time. I give it a 7 out of 10.

*As for the title, the movie is about the lunar gravity, so it does not have the same impact as "Apollo 13". But, I
 It's just a dumb little movie. But it's funny in the best way. And it's also very technically proficient in a very low budget way. The special effects are very well done, and there are a lot of good gags that didn't get a chuckle out of me the first time I saw the film. The character of the guy who thinks that he's a detective is very funny, and the cops are very well played. There are a lot of good things about this film. But... I can't help but come back to the main flaw of the film. It's just too long. I mean, at about 75 minutes, the movie should have been pretty much over by then. If it were trimmed down to about 15 minutes, it would have been a much better film.

Some of the gags at the end are pretty clever and funny. And the movie is funny in a lot of different ways. But overall, I'd say that this film is good, but not great.

 The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't too impressed. However, over the years, it has grown to be a favorite and I have seen it several times. The one thing I would like to add is the fact that it is in color, but many of the scenes are in black and white. The movie is not just about the horse, but the horse is ALSO the main character and it is his inner problems that the movie deals with. It is a very good movie, but you must be patient to get through it. Overall, it is a very good movie and I consider it to be one of my favorites.

Good movie, but not the best.

Author: jonh from United States

I really enjoyed this movie, but it isn't the best movie i've ever seen. I think that the saddest part of the movie is when the trainer is about to give up on the horse. The horse is extremely intelligent. He can understand everything he is told, but he refuses to listen to his trainer, and instead he goes off by himself
 I am not a huge fan of this movie. But I can say that it is the best movie about a girl who likes math. I just have a problem with math, not the movie. I think that this movie is about girls who are like me. They are smart, have a lot of patience, and don't really have a lot of friends. My favorite scenes are when she talks to her math teacher and when she gets the medal. <br /><br />I think that this is a good movie for people who don't like math or who like the character. Maybe it's better if you watch it in class or something.

<br /><br />I love her friend who is in college. He's so cool. He's a math genius! I hate Ms. Rhen. She's so stuck-up. She doesn't even know how to make friends. Who wants to hang out with someone who doesn't like math?<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone. If you like math, you will like this movie. If you don't, you might like this movie.

<br /><br />I give this movie a 4 out of 10.


 I was very excited to see this movie after hearing so much about it. The movie was great! The storyline was very well done and the acting was great. The actors did a very good job at portraying the characters they had to play in this film. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good story.

I remember going to see this movie not knowing what to expect. I saw it as a horror film and it was totally convincing. I don't like horror films but I remember thinking wow, this is a great film. The acting was great, the storyline was fantastic and the set was amazing. If you can get past the fact that it's a horror film, you should see it!

 I really enjoyed this movie. It was very funny, especially the parts where they were doing the skits. The movie was very well acted and the actors were very believable. The story line was very interesting, and I found the ending to be very surprising. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh. This movie will definitely do that! I found it to be a very enjoyable movie. I would also recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good comedy. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

I would like to thank the makers of this movie, and I would also like to thank all of the actors, as well. I hope that this movie does very well when it is released in the theater.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope that you enjoyed it.

By the way, this is my first movie review for IMDb.

 After the war with the Viet Minh had ended, the French forces withdrew to their barracks and the Viet Minh entered Saigon. A new nation was born and the Vietnamese were determined to build a new nation as they began to fight back against the French. A young American reporter was sent to Saigon by the Associated Press to cover the story of the new nation. The story was a complicated one, with a large number of the Vietnamese people being loyal to the French and the rest being loyal to the new nation of Vietnam.<br /><br />"The Quiet American" is a well-written, well-acted and well-directed movie. The movie is based on a novel by Graham Greene, but Greene's novel was published in 1954 and it was more than a decade later before the movie was made. The movie was filmed in France and the French countryside is shown in its best light. It is a period piece, but the movie is not too dated, as it was filmed in 1959. The movie is very good at showing the power of the French and the Vietnamese in the early days of the new republic. The movie is also good at showing the corruption of the French and the Vietnamese in the new republic. The movie is well
 On the first day of shooting, a young woman was walking across a bridge and she tripped and fell off the end of the bridge into the river. She was taken to the emergency room. Her injuries were minimal. The police officer seen at the end of the movie was the one who found her in the river. She was taken to the hospital and the police officer also went with her. The cop was the director's wife. The young woman's mother was a big fan of his and gave him the opportunity to direct. The story chronicles her recovery, her family and her life. It was a great film. I had the opportunity to interview the director. The movie was filmed in the early 70's. The director was in his early 30s at the time of filming. He is now in his late 50's. I was impressed with his insight into the film and the story. I would highly recommend this movie.

 A well-made movie, with a fine cast, that focuses on the dilemma of the human condition. It is about the inevitable passage of time, and the effects it has on a person's life. But it is not a "message" film, and as such, it is not "offending". It is simply a work of art. The characters are well-drawn, their emotions are well-played, their predicaments are well-drawn, and the overall story is well-told. It is a film that you will probably want to see again.

7/10.

Another one that is not so much a movie as it is a treatise on human nature. This is a film that, upon second viewing, reveals a lot more to the viewer. It is simply a work of art, and it is one of those movies that stays with you long after you have seen it. It is a series of well-crafted scenes, with good acting and great pacing. It is a movie that begs for a second viewing.

8/10.

A very well-made movie, one that is definitely worth seeing. Made for television, it is an excellent story about a man's struggle with
 I really enjoyed this movie. I really loved the characters, especially Manny. I also enjoyed how real the movie was. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie at all, I felt like I was actually there. Towards the end of the movie I was getting a little scared, but I was happy when the movie got over with. I was 100% satisfied with the movie and I would recommend it to everyone. It was a great movie and I am giving it a 10/10.

I thought this movie was great. I loved the characters and the actors. I thought the plot was great, the ending was a little sad but the movie was still great. I would definitely watch this movie again. I thought all the actors did a great job and I would definitely watch other movies by them. I thought the plot was very interesting and I found it believable, even though it was a little sad. The movie also made me think. I thought that the ending was a little sad, but it didn't ruin the movie. I really loved this movie and I want to watch all of the other movies made by the same people. I'd give this
 I've seen this film a few times, and it never ceases to entertain me. The movie itself is very interesting and the story is a little different in that it is told in a nonlinear way with flashbacks. The whole movie is very well done and has won awards, so it's sure to be a hit. The cast is great, but the true highlight is the director/writer, Barry Levinson. He has always put out some of the best films out there, and this is no exception. This movie is definitely a 10.

I'm a big fan of Levinson's work, and I think he's done this movie with a lot of care and attention. The story has a lot of twists, but it's a great story. The actors are good and the movie is well done. Levinson has also been very careful with the way the story is told. It's told in a nonlinear way and the flashbacks are done in a very interesting way. This movie is funny and entertaining and one of my favorites by Levinson.

 I love this film. I have seen it countless times and I still love it. It is quite possibly my favorite film of all time. This movie takes place in a small town on the west coast of America. The main character, the main character's brother, the main character's best friend, and an old friend of the main character are all about to go to war. The main character's brother, who is a marine, is supposed to be home within a few days. The main character, who is a high school senior, is going to sit on the wall outside of the school and look at the stars, if you know what I mean. The main character's best friend, who is also the main character's brother's best friend, is going to do the same thing. The main character's old friend is going to go to the cemetery to visit his father's grave. The main character and his brother are going to the graveyard to get some rocks to make a necklace for his girlfriend. The main character's brother has a girlfriend and a car that he is going to go get. The main character's best friend's girlfriend is going to get a present for her birthday. The main character's old friend is going to go get
 You may think you've seen it all, but you haven't. Take a breath and check out "The In-Laws", from the early 1980's. This movie will have you laughing out loud, and you won't be disappointed. When I first saw it, I was so shocked at how funny it was, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry! It is quite a tragicomic tale about a marriage in crisis. It is about a family who has problems and when they get together, they must face their problems as a family. It is a must-see movie.

"The In-Laws" is a 1987 American romantic comedy film directed by Buzz Kulik starring Michael Douglas and Peter Falk. It was written by Steve Martin and Bob Fisher, and it is based on the play of the same name by Neil Simon.

The film was the first to gross $100 million in the United States, and the largest box office success for both Douglas and Falk. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and two Golden Globe nominations, winning one. The film nevertheless garnered several negative reviews from
 Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Writing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Art Director, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. This is one of the best and most critically acclaimed films of all time. I love this movie. It is a drama, a love story, a really romantic and funny movie. The acting is very good, except for the fact that the movie is about a bunch of strangers. You could say that the acting is very realistic and the actors did their best to play the part they were given. Even the background people are very good. This is one of the most fabulous and outstanding movies I have ever seen.

The movie starts slowly, but once it gets going, it keeps going and going. The main character is Juliet. She is played by Anne Bancroft. Juliet is a woman who is a very successful lawyer. She is very smart, but she is also very hard to live with. Juliet's husband is played by Anthony Hopkins. He is a very successful psychiatrist. When their relationship starts to get to the point where it is about to break, a stranger enters their lives and changes everything
 Few people know that the first episode of "The Twilight Zone" was a pilot for a proposed TV series. It was written by Rod Serling and directed by John Brahm. The story was called "The Eye of the Beholder". It was a very good story, with a surprise ending, and a twist that few people could have predicted. The show was never made, but is now available on DVD. It is a good story with a very good surprise ending. It is a must see for "Twilight Zone" fans.

5.0 out of 5 stars Serling's Classic done right Format: DVD I saw the original "Twilight Zone" show when it first came on the air, and thought it was okay, but not great. Around the time I rented it, I saw "The Twilight Zone Revival" on TV, and thought it was much better than the original show. Around the same time, I rented "The Twilight Zone: The Movie", and thought that was much better than the original show. I loved the first movie, and I thought this one was even better. I've never seen the original show, so I can't compare it to it, but I can say that this show is done
 There is no doubt that Robert Altman was a talented and influential director, but after watching Nashville I am left with the impression that he was a director who never received the recognition to which he was entitled. Nashville is a well-written and beautifully acted film, and it is a shame that it hasn't received much attention from the industry or from the film-going public. Altman and his cast deserve a great deal of credit for making a very entertaining film which is also well-written, and they should be honored for it rather than left in obscurity.

Nashville is a film which makes the best use of many of the actors who have appeared in Altman's films in the past, and this is without a doubt the highlight of the film. Altman's films have often been typified by their use of a large ensemble cast, and Nashville is no exception. Altman has managed to make the use of such a large ensemble seem seamless, and this is due in part to the excellent cast that he has assembled. While the film is a comedy, it is also quite serious, and it is Altman's use of his cast to help bring out the serious side of the film. This is perhaps the greatest compliment that
 I remember seeing this in the early 80s when I was a kid. I was in love with this movie right away as I had seen the original. Thes two were both amazing. I don't know why I never saw the original when I was a kid. I saw this one and loved it right away. I remember my dad watching it and showing it to my sister and I. I'm so glad I saw this again. It's one of those movies you should see in the theater. I was so happy when I found this on DVD. I'm so glad I found out about this again. Tom Cruise is an amazing actor. I was so happy when I found out about this. This is a great movie. Just like the original. I loved this movie as a kid and as an adult as well. I love this movie as a kid and as an adult.

 I was at a party a few weeks ago and someone wanted to watch this movie. She commented that it was weird and she just couldn't get into it. I had to agree with her. I thought it was very odd.<br /><br />But in the end, I really enjoyed it. It's a really interesting movie and the acting was great. I think it was the best acting I've ever seen on a movie.<br /><br />I thought it was weird, but it was also quite interesting. I think this is a good movie for people who are bored and want something a little bit different.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie. It's a good movie, but it's weird.

5.0 out of 5 stars I agree with the first person who watched this film. Much better than the trailer would have you believe. I'm not a huge horror fan, so I'm not sure how I came across this movie. I went in expecting to see a campy, silly horror movie and left with a story that has stuck with me for quite some time now. I definitely recommend this to horror fans who want to see something a bit different.<br /><br />

 This is a strange little film. It's not the good kind of strange. It's not the bad kind of strange. It's just strange. That's all. It's not a very good film. It's a very bad film. But it's strange. Just like this film is strange.<br /><br />We've got some bad actors. We've got some bad writing. We've got some bad directing. And we've got bad editing. But we've also got a truly strange little film. It could have been an interesting film if only the actors had been better. And the director had been a little bit more careful.<br /><br />But the director had a great idea. He wanted to make a film about a man trying to pick up a prostitute. Well, the only prostitute he ever picked up was a hooker-in-a-bottle. But she was a hooker-in-a-bottle with a very bad attitude towards her job. She didn't want to do it. She didn't want to be there. She didn't want to do it. She didn't want to be there. And she didn't want to do it.<br /><br />And
 I have always been a fan of the Universal Monsters. I really love the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera. But I have to say the Creature from the Black Lagoon is my personal favorite. It has a great sense of adventure and romance. It is a must for any monster movie fan.<br /><br />I think that the choice of Richard Carlson as the star was a good one. He was excellent. He had a great screen presence and he made the character of the Creature believable. The movie is based on the fact that the Creature was a man that was mutated by scientists. He was a man who was captured and experimented on by the evil Dr. Zorg. His behavior makes sense because of this. He is not just some mindless monster that attacks people. The movie is told in a very matter of fact way. Dr. Zorg even says that he is just a "reptile" when he meets Gill-man. I think that this helps the movie a lot.<br /><br />The music in this movie was excellent. The best is the theme. The music is fabulous and so is the melody. I would definitely listen to this music. It is just a great theme
 It's easy to be cynical about the "reality" shows on television. But I have to say that this show stands as an exception.<br /><br />At least it does for me. I have watched the first season about eight times and every time I watch it I am struck anew by the families' love and devotion to each other. In this show, families are not just a topic of conversation. They are the main topic of conversation. And they are the topic that is being discussed in the home, at the dinner table, and in the barber shop. And they are the topic that is being discussed in the schools, in the park, and in the street.<br /><br />What is truly amazing is the way that these families are able to overcome poverty, racism, and sometimes even hate to achieve the kind of happiness that they find in each other. Let's not forget that within the context of these families' lives, the kids are not like the rest of us. They are the future of this nation. And for that reason alone I applaud the show.

A very interesting show

 I hadn't read the book (although I had read the trilogy) and I am glad I didn't. I was able to watch the movie without wanting to throw it out the window. The movie was so bizarre and so out of place on a sound stage that it seemed as if it had to be a television show rather than a movie. The acting was good with some spotty performances. The theme song was horrible, but the music was good. I loved the part where the zombies were chasing after a plane and it was just a few seconds too long. I don't know why they didn't just zoom in on the plane's tail and you would have seen the zombies fall through. I loved the scene where the plane was going down and the plane was smashing into the zombies but it didn't hurt the plane. It just seemed as if they were trying to make something look more realistic. It's a shame because the movie is a great concept, but the execution was off. It was not a bad movie, though. I think it's a movie people should see in order to get the idea of what could happen if there was a real outbreak.

 An interesting (albeit not quite realistic) take on the relationship between the wealthy and the poor. The rich are depicted as the ones with better lives. In the beginning they seem to be living the good life but you soon see that that is not always the case. Some people do not have the luxury of a private jet, saving the world and saving animals. If you are looking for a good movie about the struggles of those that are not as fortunate as others then this is a good one. It will make you question the situation we have today. It will make you think about what you would do if you ever found yourself in that situation.

 I loved this film! It was hilarious and had a very good story line. I loved how they were in the same class together and how they both had the same problem with the opposite sex. I had never seen the original film, but I loved the movie and the acting. I have to say, this movie did it for me. Even though it was not a sequel, I really liked the story line and the acting was great. I am giving it 10 out of 10 stars.

This is a great film. I really liked it. I thought the acting was very good and it was a good mystery. I would give this film 8 out of 10 stars. It is funny, sweet, and action packed. I hope that they make another film like this. I think they should remake the original. I loved the fact that the main characters were not perfect and were flawed. The acting was great and this film was very funny. I hope you all enjoy this film.

 This is a wonderful, wonderful movie. I was sent it by the writer, who is a member of this site, because he thought I would like it. He was right. It's a wonderful, wonderful movie...in fact, it is so very good that it deserves to be recognized. The only reason I am not giving it a 10 is because it is so short...I feel as if it could have been longer. Yeah, I'm a weirdo. I know. But I think this is worth a 10...although, I am going to give it a 9.5 just to make it easier for some people to understand. <br /><br />The movie is about a man, who died in the Vietnam War. He was a soldier in the army, and he went missing. Now, his wife, and his two daughters believe that he died in Vietnam, but his best friend believes otherwise. The friend, who also has a wife and two daughters, travels to Vietnam to find out whether or not his friend really died in Vietnam. When he does, he goes to Vietnam alone to bring his friend's body back home. <br /><br />This is a great story, and it is written very well.
 I thought this movie was great. The premise was original and I enjoyed the way it was told. The acting is also amazing.<br /><br />I also thought that the ending was well worth the wait. I also thought that the soundtrack was great and fit the movie perfectly.<br /><br />The movie is also great for anyone who is a fan of the book. I think that the movie is a must see for those who have read the book.

The Golden Compass

by Philip Pullman

rating: *****

This is the first book I ever read, and I think it was the best book I ever read. It was well written, and got me interested in other books. I don't remember the title, but I think it was just called "The Golden Compass". I had never read anything like it before, and I don't think I will ever read anything like it again. It was very imaginative, and I really enjoyed it.

 While the movie starts very slowly, it picks up in the second half, when the action begins. The action is pretty much what I expected, with a few surprises. I liked the Japanese/American relationship, which was very authentic. The characters were well drawn, especially the young American soldier. He was not the typical American soldier, but a real person. The movie had a nice ending which I did not see coming. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes war movies.

 I really enjoyed this film. It's a beautifully done, heart warming tale that takes place in the mid-to-late 1950's. A young, widowed farmer's wife, played by Julie Andrews, goes to live with her brother, played by Richard Attenborough, who is a widower and a farmer. I have to say that in the beginning, I did not like the character of the brother-in-law. He presented himself as a disagreeable, grouchy character and I found it hard to accept him as the devoted brother-in-law, but as the story progressed, I became more and more fond of him.<br /><br />The story is about a young married couple, played by Sandy Dennis and David Warner, who are having an affair in the back of a truck in the middle of a cornfield and their tragic collision with another truck, which ends in the death of the young woman. The film was very well done and the performances were excellent. I especially liked the performance of Richard Attenborough who, I think, gave a very nice performance as the reluctant brother-in-law. I read in a review somewhere that the film was based on a book by a certain author who was
 This movie is a fun filled adventure and adventure is the word. I know that some people will find this movie scary, for others it may be fun, but for me this is a fun movie. I don't want to give away the plot, but I can say that Keifer Sutherland is the lead in this movie, and he is awesome. I think that Keifer Sutherland is a great actor and I hope that he continues his career. I also thought that the movie was very well done, and I hope that you go to rent it. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good time.<br /><br />-Taylor

The Proposal is the best comedy movie!

I loved the movie and I thought it was fantastic. The movie was life like and the actors/ actresses did a great job. The movie is about a girl who has a crush on a guy who is a singer. The girl's boyfriend, who is a singer, is all good. The boyfriend and the girl get engaged and the guy leaves. The girl's best friend and her boyfriend set up the girl with the singer. The
 I've seen all the episodes of the original series of "M*A*S*H", and I enjoyed them all. I was a little disappointed in the movie, but it was still good. I had a lot of fun watching it. It was a lot of fun to see the old cast again. It was great to see the old set again. I had to laugh out loud on many occasions. Some of the scenes were a little out of context, but it was still funny. I think the movie had a good message as well. I liked the fact that it was a lot of fun. If you liked the original series, you'll enjoy the movie. I give it a 6/10. I think it was pretty good for a movie.

 I finally saw the full-length version of "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover" this weekend, thanks to my friend Jamie who moved in to my apartment and sent me the DVD. I was impressed. The film version is a lot better than the short version, which I saw years ago on television. The full version contains more of the story, and more of the story is better than less of the story. It's a good movie. I think everyone should see this.

I'm not sure if the story is for everyone, but it certainly is for me. It's a very dark story and it certainly makes the viewer think about what he or she might do in similar situations, if he or she were in the same position. I know that the story might be disturbing to some viewers, but it's not disturbing in a gratuitous or voyeuristic way. It's disturbing in a very real way, but it's a good kind of disturbing (as opposed to a bad kind of disturbing). It's good to be disturbed.

The acting in the film version is mediocre and the actors all seem to be stuck in a kind of "acting by numbers" mode; they all seem to be
 I originally saw this movie when it first came out on DVD and I was surprised to see how different the movie was from what I had seen in the previews. I thought this would be just another "B" movie "Saw" clone. I was wrong. The acting was amazing, the story was original and intriguing, and the special effects were awesome. I really recommend this movie to everyone. I have seen it a few times now, and I have never gotten tired of it. I did notice that when the movie was released on DVD it was not as good as the theatrical release. If you are a fan of the "Saw" movies, I highly recommend this movie. If you are not a fan of the "Saw" movies, I recommend this movie anyway, because it is so good.

 I just saw this movie today and was very impressed. I was expecting a crowd pleaser and this movie delivered. The message was the perfect blend of humor and fun. This movie is similar to Harold and Kumar go to White Castle but with a whole different feel. This movie is very similar to the original Harold and Kumar, but this one is a lot more comical and a lot more realistic. I also thought the movie was well put together. I enjoyed the lines and it was very well written. All in all I think this was a good movie and I hope it does well. I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie.

1 of 1 people found the following review helpful HASH(0x9b457a50) out of 5 stars A feeling of awe and wonder. June 16 2006 By Garry Coxon - Published on Amazon.com Format: DVD First off, this is not a bad movie. In fact, it is quite good. The problem is that it is very, very dull. It is a very slow paced movie. There is very little action and if you're looking for a movie that is going to make you jump out of your seat, this is not the one.

The thing that bothers me more than anything else is that I could not stop watching it. I was completely engaged from the start and I watched it from beginning to end. That is the best thing that I can say about the film.

I think that the best way to describe the movie is to say that it is a "feel good" movie. It is not a great movie and there is no reason to go out and buy it,
 This is one of that rare movie that is NOT a "Sunday afternoon movie" but a movie that you want to see again and again. I do not know where I first saw this movie, but I think it was on cable TV. As soon as I saw it, I wanted to see it again!! The acting is superb. The music is haunting and beautiful. The cinematography and set design is amazing. The story is simple, but not too simple, and the acting is so amazing that you forget that you are watching a movie. I have seen this movie several times and it never fails to make me cry. If you ever get the chance, watch this movie. You won't be sorry.

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie is so good that it makes you cry. I never get tired of watching this movie. I have seen this movie at least five or six times. I have a friend that I can watch this movie over and over with, and she does not get tired of it either. My favorite part about this movie is that it is about a girl and a boy and how they help each other. I love this movie because it is about a boy and a girl who
 This is a powerful film. It is a true story of the struggle of black people in the south during the civil rights movement. The actors are superb, the story is well scripted and the cinematography is exceptional. The only problem I had with the film was that it seemed a bit too long. In addition, I do not believe that the story was given a lot of attention in the film, and I believe that the film could have been a little more focused on the story and less on the acting. However, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes true stories of the civil rights movement as well as anyone who loves a good film.

The Biggest Culprit (1999) I loved this movie! 7 November 1999 - 8 out of 8 users found this review helpful. I think this
 This is a wonderful movie, set in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1950s. I was skeptical of the film, but it is quite good. I heard the director say the film shows the lives of many people who lived on the Berkeley campus during the 1950s. I think that is a good idea. The story focuses on three people: a married couple, Kurt and Helen, who are both bright, hard-working and idealistic; a student named Paul, who is struggling to make it in the world of academia and is going to be drafted so that he can avoid being sent to Vietnam; and the third is a young man named Frank, who is having some issues with his father and his father's new wife. Frank has a crush on Helen and is a thoughtful, kind, and genuine young man. The movie is about the changes in their lives and how those changes relate to one another, and how everyone's life is affected by the Vietnam War. The story is a little bit predictable, but that doesn't make it bad. It's a very good film and I highly recommend it.

 I saw the original "The Producers" at the Hollywood Bowl about six months ago and was blown away. I was able to get a ticket for the show's opening night and was thrilled. The show was great. I was delighted to see that the cast from the original production was back, and they were joined by some new talent as well. The show was funny. The songs were great. The cast was spectacular. I loved it. I was even more thrilled to discover that "The Producers" was coming to Broadway. I was able to get tickets to the Broadway opening night performance. I was in that audience and was blown away once again. The musical is soooooo funny and sooooooo awesome. It's the best musical I've ever seen. I hope they continue to make many more "The Producers" musicals because they are soooo fun and sooooo cool.

 This movie is a must see for anyone who loves movies like "The Big Chill" or "The Age Of Innocence" or even "The Silence Of The Lambs."<br /><br />The plot is simple but involves a plot that is so intricate, it will have you thinking about it long after you have watched the film. <br /><br />This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

 I've always been a big fan of the Rockford Files, but I didn't think they'd cast the same actor to play the same character. Well, I was wrong. The Rockford Files: Back in Action is a really good movie, but I think it's weaker than the original. The original was a little bit more 'TV' and this is a little bit more 'filmed' but without the usual TV quality.<br /><br />The film also stars Gene Simmons, as the manager of the Rockford Files. I thought that was a great casting, as Simmons is a really interesting character (if not a bit creepy). <br /><br />The movie is really good, but it's a bit too long. I thought the movie would have ended at the end of the original series, but at least they didn't cut any of the original cast.

<br /><br />Overall, the movie is great, but I'd recommend the original.

9/10.

 I saw this movie when I was writing my thesis on the works of Ingmar Bergman. I was amazed by it then and I'm still amazed now. The acting, the scenery, the camera work are amazing. The movie is very dark, even more so in the Swedish version where the dialogue is in Swedish, but the English version is not. The movie is a metaphor for the human condition, the search for identity. It's a very beautiful and haunting movie. The movie is about a man who moves to the country to work in a mental institution. He's trapped there, he can't leave because he has a commitment to his wife and son. The movie is about the world he creates for himself, the world of his own making, which mirrors his own world. The people in his world are either like him or like his wife and son. The movie is about the discovery of the self and the discovery of the meaning of life. There is a very strong religious message in the movie. The movie is very sad and very beautiful.

When I saw the movie, I didn't understand the Swedish dialogue. I was very surprised when I saw the movie with the dialogue in English. This is one of the best movies I
 This film is a real gem. I saw it in the theater and loved it. The best part about it is that the cast is perfect. Just about everyone in it is perfect. I'm sure Marisa Tomei did the best job in the film but everyone did a great job. This is a great movie to see with your kids and you will all enjoy it. It is also a good movie for parents to see with their kids. It deals with some real life issues that you will want to talk about. Take a chance and see it. You will love it.

As a parent and a teacher I can tell you I agree with Beau. I would probably have to say that this film is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time. The actors in it are all pretty good and even though the movie is based on a true story, it has little to do with the actual story. I would take the time to watch this one with my kids. I think they will enjoy it and learn a little bit more about life.

 I got this film from a local video store the day it came out and I have never been so surprised by a film in my life. It is not a typical horror movie at all. The story is about a girl who was possessed by a demon and now has a contract with the devil. She is saved by a priest who has a gift for exorcism. The two of them go to a house where the demon is waiting for a sacrifice. The demon is in fact a teenage boy. He is possessed by a demon also, but his possession was only temporary and he is now free. The two of them form an uneasy alliance and try to save the girl.<br /><br />This is not a typical horror movie in the sense that there is not really any scary parts in the movie. There are a couple of scenes that are pretty scary but they are very brief. The movie is quite funny and the characters are very likable. They are all very good actors and they play their parts perfectly. The movie is also very well made. The story is interesting and the direction is excellent. It is also a very good movie for a date night to watch with your significant other.

 A note to those who have read the book and are awaiting the movie: The book is better!! The movie is missing a lot of the scenes that take place in Rachel's life and heart, such as her first meeting with her husband, her first trip to Washington and the summer they spend in Maine. Having read the book, I can appreciate the movie a lot more and can understand why they made the changes. I have a great love for the book, as I have with all the books I've read about that time period. This is a great movie for anyone who is a lover of the American Revolution and a lover of movies. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I am going to see the movie again...

Otterville: The Story of a Whale Hunter

8 January 2002 - 2 out of 5 users found this review helpful.

I don't know what I expected, as I haven't read the book, but I thought for sure I was going to like this movie. I was wrong. The first movie I ever saw in the theater was the Sea Hunt TV series. I was in the first row, and I was mesmerized.
 I was surprised to see the negative reviews for this film because I thought that it was quite a good film for the most part. I was also surprised to see that people had problems with the use of language. The film is filled with a lot of bad language and it is not just used in a few places - it is used a lot. You really see that the characters are not too bright and do not have a lot of morals. The way things are said in the film are not made up - the characters are like that. The way the characters are written and acted make it seem like they are not normal people. I think that a lot of people who don't like this film have missed the point and might have considered the film as not being funny because they don't understand that the film is actually quite funny. There are numerous funny scenes in the film and the whole film is quite good fun. I think that people have been a bit too critical of the film and have not understood what it was trying to convey or what it was trying to say. It is also unfair to complain about bad language used in the film when there are films made today that use far worse language and are not criticised for it. The film is quite dark and

 This is a very good movie. It's about a man who is dying of cancer. He has some money left, but he decides to give it to a homeless man with a big dog. The man is so grateful, he decides to be a nice guy. He starts to help people. He tells people what's wrong with their cars, and he helps them fix them. He helps this young girl who lives in his apartment building. He even tells his boss that he's sick, and he doesn't want to go to work. He has a good heart, and I think that most people would have that kind of character. They wouldn't be so mean, and they wouldn't judge people. They would be nice, and everyone would like them. I think that everyone should have a heart like that. I think that most people should have a heart like this man. He's like a good person. He doesn't want to be mean to people, so he's nice to them.

 I remember writing a review on this movie when it came out. I was impressed with the writing and the performances. I just can't understand why it didn't do better. It might have been the time, the release of Platoon, Terminator 2, Rambo, or maybe it was just the wrong time for this movie. I remember getting a good deal of hate mail for this movie. I don't think I have ever gotten that much hate mail for a movie, and I have seen some pretty terrible movies over the years. I have seen it now a few times and it still remains a good movie, or at least it did me. It was a good story about a father's love for his son. It was a different story to the movies that were coming out at the time. It was sort of a more serious, less action packed movie. It had a good ending and it didn't get too preachy. I can understand if anyone hated it, but I think it is a good movie and well worth seeing again.

 I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. It was really cute, the acting was good, the story line was good, and the characters were believable. I love the idea of the little girl having to raise her little brother by herself. And I also love that in the end the girl is able to find her father again. This movie is a definite must see. I highly recommend it.

A pretty good movie, I would say. The beginning was a bit slow and I was a bit bored but once it picked up I was totally hooked onto the story. The acting was great and the little boy was so cute. I liked how the little girl was able to find her dad and how she was able to learn to be a good mother. I also loved how the end was so cute and I couldn't wait to see what would happen. I would definitely recommend this movie.

 I just wanted to give a heads up to anyone who may not have seen this movie. The film is absolutely brilliant. The story is so scary and intense, and the acting is great. I don't know why so many people say that this film is not scary at all. I watched some of the reviews on here, and they all said it wasn't scary at all, and the people who wrote that are making the movie sound bad because they haven't seen it. I don't know what they're talking about. This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. The acting is great, and the story is touching, and I think it is a must see. I know that a lot of people think this movie is unrealistic, but it's not. The character of the mother is not a very nice person, but that's how it is in real life. This is the kind of movie that you don't see very often. I think that it's nice that it's a horror movie and not a comedy, because I think that horror and comedy don't mix very well. If you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy horror movies, I think you should check it out.

6/10

 Not a very good movie. I only watched it because it starred the late Sonny Chiba. He was a legend in Japan, and has starred in some classic movies. He had a good performance here, but the movie itself was fairly weak. I won't give away plot details, but the plot is not all that complicated. I suppose some may see this as a positive, but I found it boring. I thought this was a real waste of Chiba's talents. The movie was filmed in Japan, and I guess it was trying to show the beauty of Japan. I have been to Japan, and I think it is an extremely beautiful country. But, I have never seen the movie "Smokey and the Bandit" and I have seen this movie. Both are not good movies.

I rated the movie at a 2/10. This is not a movie that I would recommend. It is not a bad movie, but it is not a very good one either.

 The movie was very emotional. With the love of a woman, she would do anything to save her child. The storyline had many twists and turns. The acting was well done as well.

The movie was not predictable. It gave the viewer a feel for the characters. I am a mother and this movie got me thinking about what I would do in the same situation. This was a very tough situation.

I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a feel good film as well as a thought provoking movie. It is a must see. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

I loved this movie. It had great suspense. The acting was superb. I thought the movie would be about a plane crash but instead, it was about a plane crash that was not a plane crash. The characters were well developed. It is a movie for the whole family. It is a must see. It is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It is a movie that will make you think.

 I watched this drama recently and I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire film. I really loved the way that the makers of this film came up with the story: there is a girl who is studying to become a journalist and she is thinking about going for an interview with a foreign president. She gets rejected, but then she gets the chance to interview a very famous actress who wants to give her opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You know what? You will love this drama: it is funny, it is nice and the storyline is just great. This is a very well made film and the movie makers have done a great job with their work. I recommend this film to everybody who is a bit of a film buff and who likes to laugh. I am sure that you will love this film.

Breaker Morant (1980) A very good war film! 18 September 2004 - 0 out of 1 users found this review helpful. "Breaker Morant" is a very good film: there are some very good actors in the film and the story of the film is really good. The movie tells the story of the two
 "Duel" is hands down the best of all the Rocky films as it shows that there is more to the story of Rocky Balboa than just being a dirty fighter. This film is a must see for anyone who is a fan of the Rocky franchise. It is one of the best examples of how to tell a story that is based on a true story. I remember when I was younger and my brother in law showed me this film and it blew my mind. The story of Henry Gondorff and Leo DiCaprio is a true story and is one of the best stories ever told in cinema history. The acting is superb and the story is fantastic. This film is one of the greatest films of all time. I strongly urge everyone to see this film and see why it is so great. This film is not only one of the best Rocky films, it is one of the best films of all time and a true story. I give this film a 10 out of 10.

 I had seen the trailers for this movie, and thought it looked like an interesting movie, but I had no idea just how intriguing it would be. This movie is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's an amazing story, and the acting is good, too.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is very slow and feels a little bit boring, but once the movie moves into the second half, it gets very interesting. The movie had me completely hooked, and I really never wanted it to end. The movie had a really good ending, and I thought it was very well done.<br /><br />The movie also has a good amount of humor, which was also very good.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie, and I would definitely recommend it. I give it a 10/10

 Although it would be a mistake to confuse this film with its sequel The Big Combo, this film is a worthy successor to its predecessor. For the first time we get to see the sort of urban violence that was hinted at in The Big Combo. It's not an exaggeration to say that the film's climax is as brutal as anything we've seen in the genre since the days of The Great Escape at least. One of the film's major strengths is its use of the Italian locations, depicting the grim reality of Italian life in the days before the Communist takeover in 1968. The film is also a showcase for the talents of the two leads, who are both completely convincing as the two leads in the film (the roles are clearly modeled on the folks in The Big Combo). It's a pity that the film didn't do better at the box office, but it's a shame that nobody has bothered to make a follow-up to this excellent film.

It's been nearly 2 decades since the original, but
 I saw this movie with my dad when it first came out in the theaters, and I remember it being a huge hit. I saw it again recently and it still holds up. The movie is about a girl (Jennifer Connelly) who gets a dog and leaves her boyfriend (Paul Bettany). She then meets a boy (Josh Hartnett) and they fall in love, but she realizes her dog is her true love. The movie is very sweet and has a lot of emotion, but you still feel something for the characters. The movie has a lot of great dialogue, and the use of music is also fantastic. There is one scene where the main character (Connelly) is in a library, and the music is from The Shining. I also like how a lot of the scenes are shot from the actors' perspectives, similar to the Blair Witch Project. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good tear-jerker, or a movie that makes you feel something.

 This is a movie that I knew was going to be good. I saw the trailer and knew that it would be a hit with the audience. I like this movie because it just shows how much love one person will give to get them loved back. The story is that of a man that is in a relationship but is not getting any love. He is about to give up when he meets a woman that he falls for. Will he be able to win her over? This is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to anyone. The message of the movie is to stick together, because you never know when you are going to need another person. This movie should be shown in more places because it shows how a relationship can make you feel better. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.

I recommend this movie because it's a great story and has great messages.

This movie was very good. It's a story about a comedian that loses it all and tries to get it back. This movie was very funny. I laughed a lot and it was a great movie
 A great movie. I love the opening scene, when the guy is driving and he is in the backseat and the little boy is in the front and the little boy asks him to take him to the store and the guy says, "You're crazy." I don't know what the guy is talking about. The movie is good, but it is not a classic. But it is a very good movie.

 I rented this movie from the local video store and i must say that i was very surprised by it. I was looking for a movie to watch over the long weekend and this seemed to fit the bill. It was very different from most horror movies and i think that it was a very good film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good movie that has a twist in it. I will definitely buy it on DVD.

 I am a fan of the Japanese film industry, and I have seen many of their films. This is by far my favourite. The plot, the atmosphere, the acting, the music, the cinematography, everything was superb, and all of it was very quirky and original. This is not to be missed by anyone who appreciates Japanese cinema. I, personally, saw it twice, and found it much more enjoyable the second time.

 I love this movie! I am a big fan of the TV series "The Beautiful Life of Asha" and this movie was a great way to make it even better. I love to see how the cast of the TV series are so well-prepared to play the characters in the movie. It is a great movie for anyone who enjoys a little bit of drama and romance. The story is about a girl in India who gets a job as a fashion model and moves to America to pursue her dreams. She meets a boy who is also a model and the two of them fall in love. There is also a lot of drama between the other two models, who are extremely competitive with one another. It is a great movie for anyone who loves romance and drama.

 When I first saw this movie as a child, I was intrigued by the concept, but was also very worried that it would be too scary for me. I was very pleased to see that this was not the case. The movie is kind of a light-hearted spoof, but with a very dark edge to it. All of the characters are extremely off-beat, and it is interesting to watch how the characters interact with each other. The scenes that have to do with the monsters are very scary, but I have to admit that the scenes with the family are more of a scare than anything else. In the end, this movie is a great addition to your Halloween movie collection.

 I think this is the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. I can't believe that this movie was ever considered a classic. There are a lot of plot holes in this movie, which may be intentional, but I don't think so. It could have just been poorly written. There's also a lot of things in this movie that don't make sense, but that may just be my lack of knowledge of the story. I've never seen a movie so bad that I can't forget it. I'm not a good movie critic, but I've heard better things about this movie than this. I'd like to see a movie that's as bad, but with more plot. I have to give it a 2, but I'm doing this only because of all the crap movies I've seen. I think this movie is worse than "Revenge of the Nerds", but I haven't seen that one yet.

 The first film I saw was the original 1997 version, but I had to watch the 2002 version to understand why it was a huge hit. But it is still a great film. The 2004 version is very different from the 1997 version. The 1997 version is a thriller, while the 2002 version is a horror film. The 1998 version is a thriller/action film with a powerful message.<br /><br />The film is about a man named Jack Stanek, a retired U.S. Army Ranger and a Jack of all Trades. Jack is an expert on demolitions, weapons, and explosives. He knows everything there is to know about these things. He lives in the boonies on a homestead with his wife, Susan, and his son, James. The family is hated by the local residents for the crimes Jack committed in the Army. Jack lost his leg to an IED. A short time later, Susan and James are killed in a car accident.

 The movie is a little too long, but it's a good, enjoyable film. I've seen it all before, but I still enjoyed it. It has some tense moments, and is at times very funny. The film has a great cast, especially Diane Keaton, Kevin Kline, Christopher Walken, and Chazz Palminteri. There are a few particularly good scenes that would be fun to watch over and over again. The film also has a great theme song. I really recommend this film.

Review by Jason

Like Stuck in the Middle and Sleepless in Seattle, this is a very enjoyable movie. The only thing about it that I didn't like was the ending. I was expecting it to be a little different. I was expecting the guy to win and get the girl, but it just ended like any other romantic comedy. I don't know, maybe I'm just too much of a romantic. But I'm still glad I saw it, and it's a good movie.

Review by B

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was laughing so hard! It has a wonderful premise,
 This film is a comedy and a romance, but also has a story about a family and friendship. I felt that this film was very funny and all of the actors did an excellent job. I especially liked the character, the father, played by John Cusack. He is so funny and he is so real. I also thought the actress, who played the daughter, played by Amy Smart, was very good. They act just like a real family. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes romantic comedy films.

This film is written and directed by Mark Waters. Mark and I have a very similar sense of humor. I think that is why I like his films and why I like this one so much. He is able to make all of his movies very funny and I think that is what I like most about his films.

Overall, this film is a very good film. I would recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedy films. Even if you don't like romantic comedy films, I think you would still like this one.

 Gia is a very dark, gritty and at times, disturbing film. The film is a tale of a young woman who falls in love with a man who is destroying her emotionally, and physically. There is a scene where a young woman, Gia, is beaten and raped by a man. This scene is disturbing and borderline exploitative. However, this could be due to the fact that the film is based on a true story. Gia is a very powerful film, and is not for the faint of heart. It is about a woman, Gia, who falls in love with a man who eventually destroys her. This film is not for everyone. I think this film is very powerful, and is a very honest look at the life of a young girl in the 70s.

 I have to be honest, I only watched this movie because Alfred Hitchcock was in it. I had never heard of it before and I thought it would be interesting to see what the movie was about.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. The movie is about an old man in England (Hitchcock) who is an author and is asked to write a novel about a detective. So Hitchcock starts to write the book and as he does, he starts to have flashbacks to his childhood. The flashbacks involve the murder of his father. The movie is taken from the actual book that Hitchcock wrote. The flashbacks show the murder of Hitchcock's father, the fall out between Hitchcock and his brother (who he thinks killed his father) and the years that follow.<br /><br />The movie was a lot of fun. It was a little slow at first but it got better towards the middle. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good mystery or thriller.

 This movie is an almost perfect study of the effects that a person's views of themselves and the world they live in can have on the way they relate to other people. It is an excellent study of how much psychology can be involved in the way a person acts toward another person. It is also a very good movie, with a cast that is easy to believe in, and a story that is just right for the way it is told. What I think is most interesting about this movie, is how it captures the essence of how all of us, no matter what we believe, really act and feel in all circumstances. I picked up that subtle little thing that makes us all different from one another, and was able to see it in all its delicacy. I think that that is what makes this film so powerful. I think that if we could all just see ourselves in this way, and understand that the way we see ourselves is the way that others see us, we would all find it easier to live in peace with one another.

***** Good movie. You feel for the characters.

<br /><br />I don't know what to say about this movie.
 While its not one of my favorite films, "Sleepers" is a good movie. The casting is excellent and the acting of the characters are believable. The story moves along at a good pace and provides questions at the end of the movie about the sleeper's identity. It also gives a good look into the life of a gang of young kids who are in a very tough situation. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that are more realistic than the average movie or who enjoy movies with a plot.

I'm Still Here (2010) Most interesting film I've seen in a long time. 7 February 2011 - 1 out of 1 users found this review helpful. I'm sure this film was controversial when it came out, but that was the beauty of it. The film follows the life of Chico (Johannes Kuhn) as he struggles to survive the streets of Los Angeles, while trying to make it to his acting class. What makes this film so amazing is how it is shot and the way it was edited. The cinematography of the film is excellent and captures the time, place and mood of the film perfectly. The editing
 "The Last Night" is a very well done film about a family who get together for Christmas. The story revolves around the father and his three sons. The eldest son, Jack, is in a very bad situation. Jack is a drummer in a rock band, but his career is not going as well as he hoped. He is trying to find a new record label to release his album. His band mates are growing impatient with the record label and want to go out on their own. Jack has a very good relationship with his family and he wants to continue to have a good relationship with them. But the band is starting to move away from his family and Jack is worried that if he stays in the band, he will lose his family.<br /><br />The actor who plays Jack, Jared Leto, does a good job. There are a couple of scenes where Jack's character gets angry and you can see the rage in his eyes. Leto is a very talented young actor and I think that he is going to do very well. He has a very good range of emotion and he is not afraid to use it to his advantage. His performance is excellent.<br /><br />The movie shows the good and bad aspects of
 It is not often that a film can be described as a "masterpiece", but this is one. As a teacher of the arts for many years, I have seen many films, some great, some not so great. This one stands head and shoulders above any other I have ever seen. The story itself is so rich, so complex, so fascinating, and so gripping that it gets your attention from the first frame of the film. The acting is excellent by all involved, and the cinematography and the editing are flawless. I have watched this film at least six times and will certainly watch it again. Also, I would recommend this film to anyone. It is an excellent representation of the human condition and its complexity.

The Innocents is a fine film, and I recommend it highly. It's certainly not as frothy and giddy as the other films I've mentioned, but there are moments of genuine horror. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is wonderful, and the editing is perfect. I saw this film in the theater, and have since rented the DVD and watched it several times. It's one of those films that I can
 I have no idea why this movie was so ignored, but it is an excellent movie. It's an odd mix of the paranormal and the "haunted" house genre, which makes it interesting. I suppose the only issue is that it's not really scary, but it is a good concept. Solid acting, and decent special effects.<br /><br />The people who hated this movie should be ashamed. It's a well-written, well-acted, well-shot movie that is not in any way offensive or degrading to women or homosexuals. It's a movie that just happens to be about a lesbian couple. It's not about the characters - it's about the house. It's about a family that lives in a house that has been haunted for generations. The thing is, the house is the family. The house has a past and the people who live in the house are a part of that past. They are responsible for some of the events that have happened in the house. It's a compelling and interesting idea.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't really like about this movie was the ending. I liked the ending, but it's not the kind of ending that would have satisfied me in a
 This film is a classic. It never goes out of date. It is just as good today as it was when it was released. This is a very good movie. The women are beautiful and the men are handsome.

The movie is very funny. The music is great. The cinematography is wonderful. It is a very fun film to watch. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to laugh.

One of the best comedies ever.

Author: gfk-jfk from United Kingdom

12 March 2006



Some of the best jokes in the history of cinema, the script is great and the acting is impeccable. The locations are wonderful, the music is perfect and the cinematography is simply stunning.
 I have seen this movie 4 times and each time I have been slapped in the face with a left hook. This movie is so bad it's good. It's like a funhouse mirror of us humans with a just right mix of violence, language, nudity and sex. At the time of this movie's release it was a complete shock to the system. It was so far out there that it was almost done intentionally as a joke, but it could be read as some kind of statement about what the media might do to us. It's not a movie you'll want to see but it's an experience. I don't know how you'll feel about it but I know I had a good time. I don't remember the plot but I remember the actors were great. I liked all the secondary characters like the working girl. Even the manager of the apartment building was pretty cool. I also liked it when the guy got nailed in the ass and when the girl got her clit torn off. The only thing that bothered me was the director had no idea how to make the movie. He didn't know where to start or where to end. I think they cut it too short. I think the movie was supposed to be a full length
 In the true spirit of a detective story, "L'homme qui valait trois milliards" (The Man Who Was Worth Three Million) is a compelling drama. The story focuses on a man whose life is changed completely when he is accused of embezzlement. The film also raises questions about society's responsibility towards people whose lives have been stolen. The film is based on a true story and stars Jean Rochefort, Gérard Darmon and Gérard Depardieu.<br /><br />The character of François Poiret (Jean Rochefort) is one of the most intriguing characters in film. Although he may not be the most charismatic of leading men, I found Rochefort to be extraordinary. He has a very subtle and understated acting style and I think that he is one of the best actors working today. His performance is not as flashy as say, Christian Bale, but it is still quite impressive. Darmon does a very good job as his personal assistant, who is always on his back, trying to make sure that he is never caught. The rest of the cast is also quite good, but nothing to write home about. The supporting cast includes Gérard Depardieu
 I have nothing but praise for this movie. I had the misfortune of not reading the book, but it was still a very well done movie. I don't see how anyone could not like it. It has a lot of emotion and heart and is VERY moving. I saw it at the theater and was in tears by the end. I love Toni Braxton, and she is so great in this movie. I'd love to see more movies like this one. I hope it's not too long before the second one comes out. If it's made into a series of movies, I'd love to see Mariah Carey in it. She would make a great Della. You need to see this movie.

 I came across this movie during a bout of insomnia one night. I found myself watching it, and it was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I am a big fan of drama and comedy, and this movie is made of both. The plot is simple, but it really works. The acting and the cinematography are great. The movie is very funny, and it's not too long, it's right around 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is the perfect length. I loved it, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that's good, but it's not too demanding.

This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. What made it so good was the characters and the plot. The plot was a very simple story about a guy who is not very likable but was a successful businessman who made a lot of money and was spoiled by his father. He had a girlfriend who he loves, but she loves someone else. He hires a prostitute to have sex with, and then she gets pregnant. He can't marry her, and he can't have an abortion. These are the main problems he faces. The movie focuses on those problems and the journey he
 The first thing you notice with this movie is the quality of the acting. The leads are the best. The story is good, and the dialogue is funny. I think the movie is really good, but I don't think it's as good as "Waiting for Guffman". I really liked the way they did the movie. I think it's really good, but as I said it's not as good as "Guffman". It's still a good movie. It is definitely worth renting.

 I first saw this film in 1994 when I was living in London. Since then I have seen it countless times and each time I am always moved by it. The film is about a German woman who falls in love with an Englishman. All the comedy is based on the fact that she is a high placed Nazi official and he is a Foreign Office official who is married to an English woman. Theirs is a love story that is impossible to understand. I think that you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this film. It shows how the country that we live in is divided by the symbols of the State and religion.

The film is very funny, but it is also very sad. We see the Munich Olympics in the background and the different countries represented by the different actors. When the film was made the TV was the main medium of entertainment, so the film was a bit ahead of the time. The film is very well acted, specially by the two main actors, but the film is not a masterpiece. It shows the unhappy love story between a German and a Jew and all the people who are involved in it. The film was not very popular in the USA when it was first released, but I think that it is better
 There are a number of movies that are so bad that they are so bad that you almost want to watch them just for the sheer entertainment value of watching a film that tries so hard to be bad that it is actually good. This is one of those movies. There are moments in this film that are so bad, so over-the-top, that they are actually good. Some of the jokes are actually funny and the film as a whole stays entertaining. If you are looking for a decent bad movie, then this is the one to watch.

<br /><br />The story of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Massacre" is not one that you will see in many other movies. It has nothing to do with the original and is actually a sequel to the 1974 film. In this one, we follow the story of a group of teenagers who go on a road trip. The movie's basic premise is that they end up in a small town where the residents are a bunch of psychopaths with a penchant for really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
 The film is the classic tale of a young man coming of age in the world of the inter-war years. The film is a comedy and a drama, a comedy and a tragedy, a comedy and a tragedy all in one. It is a great film, that explores the viewer's mind and emotions, and brings a smile to the face. It is my favourite, and it is a film that I would recommend to anyone who wants to see a great film.

A Classic.

5.0 out of 5 stars It's a Horror Movie But It's NOT Rated R....To Be Honest..., 9 Feb. 2005

By Willy N. - Published on Amazon.com

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The film itself is really good, but it's not really a horror movie. I think it's more like a thriller. It's about a kid that's being chased by a bunch of gangsters. He has a bag full of money and he's running away from them. When he stops running, they catch up to him. He decides to play a trick on them by shooting his gun into the air. He hides in the trunk of a car and climbs out when they're not looking. He sneaks away into
 In the summer of 2004, I was invited to a screening of a new movie at a local theater in my hometown of Toronto. I was surprised when I learned the movie was about a group of men who are trapped for an unspecified period of time in a room, having to endure their own thoughts, fears, and desires. I had seen several movies about men trapped in confined spaces and was quite familiar with the themes that were present in this film. However, I did not know that the movie would be about four men in a room for a year, not all at the same time. I also did not know that this movie would be filmed entirely in a single room. I was prepared to see a typical suspenseful drama; however, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that the movie was more than that. I found that the movie effectively portrayed the intense emotions and intense feelings of the men trapped in the room. It also presented some very interesting, thought provoking, and sometimes humorous characters. The story was actually quite thrilling and kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. I found this to be a very good movie, and one that I would recommend to anyone who likes movies about men in a confined space.

7/10
 When I first watched this film I was very disappointed, however, after a few times through it, I realized that this is one of the most inventive and intelligent films I have ever seen. I was especially impressed with the fact that the film was created by a woman. Yes, that is right, a woman. And she did this all by herself. The fact that there are so many talented women today is incredible. I was very impressed to see that the director of this film was a woman (Dorothy B. Hughes). The director did a remarkable job in her first film with Gene Saks, who did a perfect job in this film. Gene Saks is one of the most talented actors around, and he did a great job with this role. Gene Saks also did an excellent job as the director of this film. This film is so good because of the talent involved, and not just the director. The cast were all exceptional actors, but Gene Saks was the most outstanding actor in this film. He was convincing in every role he played, and he always had a great performance. The story was very interesting, and there were a lot of twists and turns in the story. I think that this film is a good example
 I don't usually watch TV-series, but I decided to watch this one because I like the name of the girl that plays the main character of the series (Susanna Thompson). I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the series, which is a bit different from the usual TV-series, also because the series is not based on any particular book, but on a film. It's a bit more realistic and has more depth in the characters. I found Susanna Thompson to be an excellent actress and I hope that she will continue in this series. She is also very sexy! ;-)<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a very good series. So don't hesitate and watch it! :)

Susanna Thompson, who plays the leading role of a female homicide detective in Portland , Oregon , is a very talented actress. That's why I decided to watch the TV-series, which is based on a film of the same name. The storyline is very interesting, and when I saw the first few episodes of the series, I was surprised that they were not based on a particular book; they
 I just got to watch this movie for the first time, and it seems to be a very good one! <br /><br />I don't know what was so special about the movie that I didn't even know it existed before I just found it of the web and that's all I have to say, but it is a very good and interesting movie which I think I will watch again some time. <br /><br />I sincerely hope that you will enjoy it too! <br /><br />Mila Jovovich, the actress who plays the role of Amanda, is one of my favorite actresses in the Hollywood, and I really like her other movies, especially the one she did with Sam Rockwell called "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind".

So, I think that if you liked her other movies, you will like this one too, and you will see that she is a very good actress. <br /><br />I will recommend this movie to all of you who are interested in this genre, and especially to all of you who are fans of Mila Jovovich.

One more thing: I think that if you watch this movie and see Mila Jovovich in something
 This is an awesome movie. I have seen this movie since I was a teenager and I still love it today. It was one of the first movies I had as a child that I didn't mind watching over and over, and it still holds up as one of the best. It tells the story of Michael and his family and how they are living in their suburban home and how they all get introduced to Michael's younger brother Billy, who gets a new baby brother named Michael and how his mother, Alice, is determined to raise the two of them as best as she can. The movie is very entertaining, it has some wonderful humor, but also has its serious moments as well. It also has some pretty interesting and realistic parts to it, because it's based on a true story. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good family film to watch.

 It's been a while since I read the book, but I'm sure this movie was close to the book. I was impressed with the cast, especially Cusack, who was quite good in a more modern-day role. I really enjoyed this movie. It had a very nice feeling to it, and it just seemed like a beautiful, simple story. It's a great movie for a date night!

After reading the book and seeing the movie, I was a little disappointed. It seems as though the film didn't do the book justice. There were a few things left out and I think the ending was a little short.

But overall, I would recommend this movie for the romance and for the actors' outstanding performances.

 I really liked this movie. It's very suspenseful, especially the first ten minutes. There are a lot of twists and turns. It's about a little girl who lives in the woods with her dad. He was a scout and that's why she is also a scout. They are also training to be a detective. They live in a cabin in the woods. They have a little dog named Ruby. She has a friend named Janet. She is a new girl at her school. Her dad buys her a birthday present and she brings it home. Janet's dad doesn't like her and he doesn't want her to go to her dad's birthday party. Ruby finds out that she has a birthday present, so she goes to get it. They both go to the birthday party and they get lost in the woods. They see a house and they knock on the door. The lady answers and she's an old lady. She takes them in and takes care of them. The dad asks her if she has any children and she said she has two. He was excited to find out that there is another girl living in the woods. He thinks it'll be fun. She has a birthday party for him and he goes. He comes home and
 "The Book of Life" is a very interesting animated film with great characters and a really good story. I really liked how it was put together, it was very creative and original. The music was pretty good too. The only problem I had was with the plot, it was a bit weird, there was a lot of plot holes in it, but the film was still good. Overall, I think this film was very artistic and creative, it was a good film.

A film that only gets better and better as it goes on.

Overall, the film is really good, it is more like a visual poem, with a story line. But it is still very original and creative. I really liked the animation, it was very artistic. The characters were very good, there was a lot of them and they were very different from one another. I also liked that the film was set in a modern setting, I thought it was a very original setting. The film was very funny, and I also liked that there was a lot of action in it. The
 While I don't have a lot of experience with film, I found this movie to be a little slow, but still interesting. Its not a very fast-paced flick. Its a little more serious than I would have liked, but it was still entertaining. I am not sure that I would watch it a second time, but I would recommend it to someone who enjoys a little character development more than action (like myself.) I gave it a 7/10.

I am a fan of the first film, so I was a little disappointed in this one. Some of the characters were already introduced in the first film, so we were introduced to them a little too soon. I am also not a fan of the 'good girl' character in this film. I was expecting a little more from the female lead, but it was good for a little comedy relief.

I am looking forward to the next film, but I hope that it will be a little better than this one. I would give this one a 6/10.

8/10

Give it a chance, its not a bad film.

See the first film before you see this one - the first one is a much better film.

 this movie was fun,a little grown up and not what i expected.it was funny,cute and in some points disturbing.Finn is not your average jock and is something more.he is a good guy who likes to make people laugh.he is not mean or a bad person,he is funny,but can be a little insecure.i liked it and i would definatly watch it again.

The main characters of Finn, his best friend, and the girl who always follows him around, but is never noticed, complete with funny, quirky characters! This movie is so funny, and the dialogue is so funny! The plot, while not an amazing one, is still pretty good. This movie is perfect for people who like funny, quirky comedies! I love this movie and definatly recommend it to anyone who likes funny, quirky comedies! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!

 I haven't seen this short, so I can't comment on how good it is, however, I can comment on the humor. If you've seen the movie "Juno", then you know that the main character is a sarcastic, smart-mouthed, 15 year old girl, who has a good sense of humor. In "Juno 2" the character is played by a boy, but it could have been played by any girl who can act and has a good sense of humor. The jokes and sarcastic remarks don't come out of nowhere, and they are funny, because they are believable. I was laughing at this movie. The jokes are funny, and the characters are likable, so I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes funny movies.

I give this movie a 8/10. I hope you check it out, and enjoy it as much as I did.

 I watched this movie on a flight back from London to Chicago. This was my first time seeing it and I absolutely loved it. It was a very good movie, and had many great moments. I loved the fact that it kept being fun and kept giving the viewers a good time. I also enjoyed the fact that it had the same characters we have always seen in movies about Chicago, and the same settings we have seen in past movies. It was just a nice relaxing movie to watch. I will definitely be watching this movie again in the future.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie about Chicago, and/or the gangster era in Chicago, then this is the movie for you.

Billed as a remake of North By Northwest, this movie is NOT a remake of the original. They have nothing to do with each other. The cast is very different, the plot is very different, and the ending is rather different. The only thing they have in common is they both take place in Chicago. I would not call this movie a remake of North By Northwest, rather a remake of Taxi Driver.
 It's the first time I've seen this film on the big screen- it's an early British film, made in the late 50's, and it's by the great Tony Richardson, who went on to direct "The Entertainer" with Laurence Olivier and "Tom Jones" with Albert Finney. Tony Richardson, like his brother John, was a great movie director- a real auteur, who made many great films. He made this film for the BBC, and it's a very good production, with a great cast. Brilliant performances by his brother John Richardson (as well as Peter O'Toole, who was a great friend of Richardson's), Vanessa Redgrave, and Richard Attenborough. A real classic of British cinema, and the best of the 50's, to boot.

The film is about two sisters, Nicola and Anna, who are in love with the same man, and their struggle to be together. It's a really good film, and the scenery is absolutely stunning. Filmed in gorgeous rural England, in the beautiful English countryside. The film is especially good because the cast is superb, and the story is interesting and well-written. Some great scenes, and the whole film is
 Very nice, though not as good as some of the others, I thought. I like the beginning, the first scene and the ending. It seems to me more realistic than most of this kind of story. I just don't like the part when people are shouting. Maybe a little bit of film-noir, but a little too short to be called a real movie.

Maybe in the future somebody will make a movie about his life. A real story, not a Hollywood-version. Maybe then it will be better.

Maybe those who are not interested in his story, can skip this. But there are so many things to learn about the guy, that it would be a pity not to look into it.

I don't have to watch the movie over and over again. I think this is enough for me.

 The good: The music, as always, is terrific. The scenery is beautiful, as is the photography. The story is interesting, and the acting is good, although the leads are predictably bland. The editing is tight and the pacing is good. The bad: The story is very cliche and predictable. The leads are very, very bland. The ending is ridiculous. The end result is a good but forgettable movie, for people who like the music, the scenery, and the great photography.

I'm guessing that this movie will be considered a masterpiece by the usual people. It's not. It's a good film, if you like that kind of thing. It's neither a masterpiece nor a bad film, but a film that is good for a couple of hours of your life.

See this movie if you like the music and the scenery, and if you like that kind of movie.

 I saw this movie on a plane, and it was filmed during a long flight to Europe, so I was probably not in the best mood to appreciate it, but I did. It is a very serious movie about the life of an American soldier in Japan. In the movie, the soldier is a young man who isn't sure about his own personality. He is looking for a purpose, and finds it in the army. He begins to realize that he is more than just a soldier, and finds happiness and personal growth. The movie is well-made, with a good plot and good acting, and the soldiers' uniforms are very well-made. If you want to find a movie that is very serious, but also has a little bit of humor, I would recommend this one.

 I haven't seen the movie, but I have read that it was based on a true story. If so, it would be the greatest love story on film ever, and it would make a great novel as well. It is technically very well done, the cinematography, the costumes, the sets, the acting, the music, everything. The story is so simple, yet it is so true and powerful.

 I'm not sure how I missed this movie when it came out but I'm glad I did. I found this movie to be a very enjoyable movie. It's one of the few movies I've seen recently that has a story that's original without being out there. You get to see how Michael Nouri runs the family business while his wife is in the hospital and how he and his brother are dealing with the change in the family business. How business is changing in the new century, is a very interesting movie.<br /><br />I would have given this movie a 10 but I felt like there were some parts of the movie that could have been cut out. The movie itself is about an hour and thirty minutes but I felt like the movie could have been about twenty minutes shorter. The movie is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and still enjoy it. I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes movies about family, business, and romance.

 I caught this one on TCM the other day. I hadn't seen it before and I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it was quiet. I was surprised when I saw it. I thought it was very well done. No one does period pieces like this anymore. It's a wonderful movie. There is nothing better than watching a movie like this. The acting is incredible. The scenery is breath-taking. I recommend this movie to anyone, anytime, any day of the week.

Even if you've seen it before, it's worth watching again.

It's about a young woman, who had a bad experience in South America, and who, after many years, decides to take revenge. The story is told over 3 acts, and it is a very satisfying ending.

I only wish it were longer.

 This is a really cute movie that kids would enjoy. It has two little girls who are very cute, it has good music and a good message about not being mean to others. It is a good family movie. I liked the part when they got on a boat and were on their way home. I really liked the part when they were at the airport and were waiting for their plane. I liked the part when they were at their hotel room, and they were all dressed up in their little party dresses. I think that kids would like it, I think they would find it cute and funny. I think kids would like the part where they are at the airport and it is pouring rain and the girl is getting worried and upset, but the other girl is being nice to her. I think kids would like the part where they are on the airplane and it is thundering, and the girl is scared. She is scared that she might have to sit in the front seat. In the end, they get on a plane, and they all have a big adventure, and they end up going home. I really liked this movie.

 A touching and sensitive film about a girl growing up in the Midwest.<br /><br />The film follows the life of a young girl (Emily VanCamp) who is left by her parents in the care of her grandparents. As she grows up, her grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, are portrayed as loving, loving grandparents, but they can't quite figure out their own role as grandparents. Emily's parents are also portrayed as loving parents, but as they are on the verge of separating, they seem to have given up on their daughter who is too young to understand what is going on.<br /><br />The film itself is very well done. It is beautifully shot, and the acting is excellent (particularly VanCamp). I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama about family and human relationships.

 I've only heard of this movie twice and I won't hear it again. I've always been a fan of westerns. And I don't think this one was particularly well done. It doesn't have any particular plot or story which is why I was disappointed. I just wanted to watch a western and this wasn't it. It wasn't particularly funny, it wasn't particularly scary, and it wasn't particularly violent. Maybe it could have been a television movie or a made for TV movie. I guess that's the only reason I disliked it. It was a western that didn't live up to its potential. I think it was an average western.

I haven't watched the original yet. It's a western based on a true story about a man who lived in the old west and he was a fugitive. And he was a bounty hunter. He went out of his way to get the bounties on the people he was after. But his wife and his daughter were taken hostage and they were going to kill them if the bounty was not paid. So he had to go out and get the money, but to get the money he had to get the bounty. And he had to get the bounty on the ones who took
 I loved this movie, it is not just a movie about a boy and a girl, or a girl and a boy, but about the world. The whole movie is about the world, about how different the "world" is and how it is. I don't think this is a movie for everybody, it is more for people who have lived in a world (or wants to live in a world) where people have a different religion and live in a different country. The movie also shows how it is to do something that is not "normal" in the world and how it is to live your life (in the beginning) and how you feel when you've done something that is not "normal", or "normal" or "expected". I am not a person who cares about religion, but I think this movie should be watched by everyone and everyone should watch "World Changes", because it is a movie about the world and what kind of world we have and what kind of world we will have. I will recommend this movie to my friends, because I think that all people should see this movie, because it makes you think about the world.

 This is a surprisingly funny, well-written movie. It is not at all a comedy of errors, as some have called it. In fact, I have seen a number of movies that clearly fall into that category and this one does not. It does, however, present a number of funny situations, and is well acted by the cast. I found it to be a very entertaining movie. The story is not complicated, but the acting and writing are so good that it is entertaining. The best part of the movie is definitely the pacing. The movie starts out with a bang, and continues at a good pace to the end. This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again and still be entertained.

I have to recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be entertained and not to be confused. It is a good movie.

Cheers (1982) Episode 9, Season 3 It's a great episode! 22 March 2005 - 1 out of 1 users found this review helpful. This was a great episode. I thought it was a lot of fun. I like the idea that everyone is watching the show. I think it is a great idea, and it is a lot of fun. I like a lot of the guest stars that were in this episode and I think they did a great job. I thought the script was very well done and I thought that
 This is a great movie. The story is simple and you can easily follow it. But the most important part is the actors, who give their best to the movie. The characters are very well defined and develop throughout the movie. I have never seen a movie where the actors have such good chemistry on screen. They have been in so many movies before and I can't believe they are all done by the same person. I have bought some of his records and can only say that this guy is really talented. I really hope that he makes more movies. He has a great voice and can easily carry a movie. I hope to see many more movies with him.

(PS: I don't know how I could have been so lucky to live in Denmark, where this movie was filmed. I was stationed in Germany when I first saw the movie, and I went to Denmark several months later)

(PS2: I saw the movie in the DVD and VHS release, which is more than I can say for the movie itself. The DVD has a pretty good picture, but the VHS is much better. The VHS has a better picture, and a better sound quality. I bought the
 What do you get when you add a bunch of students for a "field trip" to a college film festival, a near-death experience, a stalker, a theft, a disaster, a rape, a kidnapping, a knife fight, a suicide, a murder, a murder of a student, a man-on-the-street interview, a British murder mystery, a lost girl, and a new film about a murder to a college film festival? A great little film about life and death, a murder mystery, and a great story told by a great cast. The cast is full of character and the story is told in a very entertaining way. The story is funny, the characters are great, and the editing is very well done. The only thing that would have made this film better, would have been a better ending. I rate this film a 9 out of 10.

I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good mystery, a good film festival, and a good film.

Two quick comments to make this a 10 out of 10. I was very happy that the film was not rated R. The movie is not offensive or "R" for "R" rated. It is a very good
 I have to say, I grew up in a mid-west conservative town, where abortion was not discussed. I have been exposed to a wide array of life views, and have found the film to be not only profoundly moving, but also very insightful and provoking. I am very glad I got the chance to see this film, it is a wonderful piece of work.<br /><br />The message and the film are quite similar. It deals with abortion, but not just the abortion that occurs in the first trimester, but also the abortion that occurs in the third trimester, when the fetus is not a person, but an embryo. The film covers a wide range of issues that relate to abortion: the relationship between mother and child, the nature of abortion and the personhood of the fetus, the nature of abortion and the morality of abortion. It is a film that is far more than just a portrayal of a woman who chooses to have an abortion. It is a film that speaks eloquently on the nature of life, which is not just a natural biological product, but a human spirit. It makes you think about the nature of society and what we are doing to our children. It makes you question your own beliefs. It is
 I saw this movie when I was a young teenager and it was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. I spent all that weekend watching this movie and the next day I went to see it again. I have seen it about 15 times since. The first time I saw it I was in awe. The second time I started to understand it a little better and started to get into the movie. By the third time I was fully into it and was hooked. I have seen this movie about 10 times now and I still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it. I don't really know what to say about this movie. The storyline is brilliant and it is very well acted. The characters are well developed and I especially like the way the movie is shot. It is very artistic. I haven't seen many movies that have had such an impact on me but this one was one of them. I love watching movies like this because they are so well done and they are a lot of fun. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes well acted movies and artistic movies. This movie is a must see.

2.0 out of 5 stars Strange and wonderful film... Format: DVD I think that this is a very odd
 I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the 2010 AFI Film Festival. It had a very small but devoted following, and I was not disappointed. The film takes many liberties with the facts of the Kennedy assassination, but it captures the spirit of the time and the passion of the era. The performances are excellent, with a very strong lead by Joaquin Phoenix. The film is a bit light on the details of the assassination and the aftermath, but it's still an entertaining and well made film.

5.0 out of 5 stars Joaquin Phoenix is spellbinding. A MUST SEE! Format: DVD The story of John F. Kennedy's assassination is told through the eyes of Lee Harvey Oswald, a young man who dedicated his life to the Russian Communist cause. He was a former Marine sharpshooter and a fanatical Communist. He was also a poor student and a poor marksman. In the film, Oswald meets Lee Harvey Oswald, a desperate young man with a large ego and a strong sense of self-importance. On the surface, he seems like a good guy. He has a loving wife, a beautiful home, and a small savings account. He is also a leftist Communist and a believer in the Russian
 I saw this not too long ago and I was blown away. The visuals were stunning, the characters were likeable and the story was great. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It would've been better left open ended, but I guess that's the result of being a piece of fiction(but it would've been nice to know exactly what had happened to the main character).

The Last of the Mohicans (1992) A masterpiece of the American west. 4 February 2003 If you watch this, you will easily be able to see why it is the most memorable movie of the early 90s. The main character is one of the most interesting characters in any movie I've ever seen, and the whole movie is just so well put together. There are a lot of good actors, and the characters are portrayed as well as they are supposed to be. If you're a fan of the movie, then you'll be a fan of the book too.

American Psycho (2000) Not quite as good as the book. 4 February 2003 - 1 out of 1 users
 I mentioned this film earlier in the thread, but in today's post. I am going to mention it again because it is a good film, but I have to mention that it is a very dark film. It is based on a true story about a man who was a murderer in the forties, because of his work in the concentration camps. His son was a good boy. He was a soccer player in America and he was a good boy. But he went to Europe to play soccer again and as with many things, he went to Europe to be with a girl. He was killed. And so it is a very dark film. It is a very good film, but you have to be careful about it. I have to recommend it for that reason alone.

So, I know what you are thinking right now. You are thinking, "I read the book." I know you did. I read the book too. But the book is not a good book. It's a good book. But it is not a good film. The film has been very well done by the director, but it is a very dark film. The book is dark too, but the film is very dark. The movie is very well done
 This film is a great example of how a film can be made to be as good as possible by giving the right cast and crew. It also shows that a good script is as important as the director, cinematographer, and the cast itself. It is a film that everyone should see, and I am glad that I did.

<br /><br />The film is about a young boy named Sam (played by the young actor Patrick Fugit) who lives in a small town in the country with his mother, father, and his younger brother, Kevin (played by the young actor Tommy Mulligan). His mother is a stay-at-home mom and his father is a truck driver. Sam is told by his mother that his father is indeed coming back, but he is not coming back in time for Christmas. Sam cannot tell his father that he has not received the present he was supposed to get for Christmas, so he tells his mother that his father is coming. She tells him that she will be able to get it for him, but that it will be the last present they get. Sam, who is an only child, is very upset when his father does not come with the presents, but, soon, he
 This movie is definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. I love horror movies and I've seen almost every horror movie ever made. Some of the best horror movies ever made are 'The Exorcist', 'Aladdin' and 'The Shining'. There is one other movie that is better than all of them. That movie is called 'The Ring'. And that's what this movie is to me. The Ring is a movie about a girl who finds a videotape in the woods and then watches it. And then the whole movie is about her trying to figure out if the tape is fake or not. I've seen this movie many times and I've always been on the edge of my seat and I really wanted to see it again. The Ring is a really good horror movie and it's definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The Ring is a very good movie to watch while you are eating dinner because the movie's very scary and will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you like horror movies, you'll definitely like this movie. I think that you should see this movie over and over because it's a really good movie to watch. I've seen this movie a lot and I
 Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this when I bought the DVD, but I really should have. The acting is very good, the story is interesting and the humour is good. The plot is in many ways clichéd, but I think that adds to the charm of it. The humour is slapstick, but it works well. The film is four and a half hours long, but it doesn't feel that long. If you like the genre and you like the sort of films that feature farcical situations, you should have fun watching this.<br /><br />The DVD is 2 discs and a commentary track. The commentary track is very interesting. It is interesting to hear the director talk about the plot and how they filmed certain scenes. The director also describes the plot and the film. The plot is quite simple, but it is well told.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this film. The film is well made and very good. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a very good film. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the sort of films that feature farcical situations.

4.0 out of 5 stars Fun, but not a classic. Format
 The original version of this movie was better than the remake. I guess perhaps some of the more famous people in the remake were not involved in the original version. I like the actress who appears in this remake. She is very good as the heroine. The scenery was good too. I think some of the dialogue was inappropriate for the storyline. It was strange for someone to be that impressed with a fluff made by a magazine. <br /><br />I was willing to give the remake a chance because it was an old movie and it was being remade by a studio that has no real reputation for making quality films. I was not disappointed. I like the new version with its hip, stylish look. I like the new actors. This remake has a lot of funny lines. It also has some genuine moments of drama as well. It is not a bad remake now that it is a good film again.

 I came across this movie through the trailer on tv but I've never seen the whole movie.<br /><br />I had to watch it because, well, I liked the trailer and because it had to do with a similar theme as "The Wicker Man".<br /><br />I totally enjoyed it, it was a fantastic movie, the acting was fantastic and the atmosphere was perfect.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and a good horror-movie.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9/10.

 It took me a long time to watch this film as I didn't like the subject matter. However, I think it was a very well acted and well made film. It reminded me of the film 'The Traveler' (not sure if it was from the same director) which was also a very well made film. It's a very scary film, but I found it hard to concentrate on the characters as I was too busy looking at the locations. I know it's a long film, but I still believe it could have been shortened. However, I was very impressed by the score and the cinematography. It was also very well directed. I didn't like the ending, but I also didn't like 'The Traveler' ending either. A very different film, but one that is definitely worth watching.

5.0 out of 5 stars A different film Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I had a hard time deciding if I was going to post anything on this film. The movie was very interesting and very well done. The cinematography is beautiful and the story is strong. The ending leaves you with a thought that you may never be able to figure out. I recommend this movie to anyone.

 I have never seen a movie that grabbed me like this one. I watched it over and over again. I just can't get enough of this movie. The story is so believable and the acting by the kids are fantastic. They are so convincing as the main characters. I have never laughed so hard when watching a TV show. I have been a fan of the show ever since I saw the first episode of the first season. This movie is so much better than the TV series. I think the only thing I don't like about the movie is that there are no more episodes in this movie to watch. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must get it. I highly recommend this movie.

<br /><br />I loved this movie. It was so funny, from the beginning to the end. It was so believable. All the way through the movie I was laughing and not wanting it to end. I could watch this movie over and over again and still laugh. My favorite part in the movie was when they found the rat lab. It was so funny. I also liked it when they thought they found the rat lab
 The movie was very good. Very suspenseful. It's a must see for everyone who likes to be scared. The only thing that I would have liked to see was that the movie had a little more blood. It seemed a little to clean, like maybe they didn't want to get too much blood on the screen. But the movie was great. I just don't want to see the other one. I'm very curious to see the next one. I think it's going to be even better than the first one. I can't wait for the next one. I don't know who's in it but I'm sure it's going to be even better.

 A wonderful film that brings the same intensity and honesty to the issue of AIDS as the previous Piège worked with the issue of racism. The film is about two people who are in love, but who are both afraid of being infected with AIDS. As the story unfolds, we find out that the two are connected through the deaths of their fathers, who both died of AIDS. In 1998, the film was awarded the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

The cast is terrific, and the film is beautifully shot by director Bertrand Blier. The film is a joy to watch, and is a must-see for anyone who loves great movies.

 There are two documentaries in this series, and they are both interesting and informative. One is on the history of the Rockettes, who dance in the famous Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular, and the other is on the history of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Both are wonderful, and I enjoyed both. The first is especially fascinating and I learned a lot about the history of the Rockettes and what they did before they started dancing in the musical. It was fascinating, and I loved it. The second is also fascinating, but it is about the history of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which is an amazing history in itself, and it is fascinating. I loved it, and I think it is a great documentary. It is informative and entertaining. It was great, and I loved it. I highly recommend it. The first is great, and the second is also great. I love them both. Both are great, and they are both wonderful. I love them both, and they are both fantastic. They are both good, and they are both great. I loved them both, and they are both good.

 This is a great movie that's made in the same style as "The Blair Witch Project" but doesn't have the trademark Blair Witch look. I really enjoyed watching this movie and would definately reccomend it to anyone. There's a very good story and it's very suspenseful. It's also a nice change of pace from the horror movies you normally see.

If you're a fan of the Blair Witch Project you'll love this movie. It's a great way to fill in the time until your next
 If one had to point to a film for which the words "Hollywood" and "cinematic" are synonymous, it would be this one. The movie is a reminder of a time when the pioneers of cinema worked with not only their heads but also their hearts, their guts and their guts, and made movies that were great not only because of their quality but because of their humanity. This is the first and last word on this film. <br /><br />It is a coming of age story with a twist, not merely a tale of a boy who grows up, but a tale of a boy who starts out as an orphan and takes off as an orphan. It is a story of a boy who knows what he is going to do and then does it, in a way that is often very difficult to do. It is a story of a boy who is told to stay within certain limits, but who knows that he can and must go beyond those limits. It is a story of a boy who finds that he can not only go further than he thought, but be better than he thought. It is a story of a boy who tries to be a hero, a boy who tries to be a man, and who finds
 The best thing about this film is that it is a work of fiction. The story is that of a man who loses his wife and two children in a car crash, and then sees his wife walking down the street. He gets in his car and follows her, and ends up in a car crash as well. He wakes up in the hospital, and when he's told that his wife and children died, he sees them walking down the street. He follows them again and crashes into the same car. He's told that his wife and children died again, but he sees them walking down the street again. He follows them again and rams into the same car again. He's told that his wife and children died again, and he sees them walking down the street again. He follows them once more and crashes into the same car again. He's told that his wife and children died again and he walks down the street again. And then, he wakes up in the hospital a third time, and he's told that his wife and children died again. This is the most absurd story ever told, and yet I couldn't stop watching it. The story is just that absurd, and it's so well acted that it's hard to be annoyed
 I have not read the book, but from what I have read I think the movie is very well done. I like the way the movie turned out, even though my favorite character has been left out. I do think that at some point he should have been brought in. I also like that the time period was not changed too much from the book. There were a few extra scenes that I thought were funny. I like that the movie did not feel like a typical movie about the Civil War. It was about the emotional and personal aspects of the war. I think that it was done very well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie.

All I can say is that this movie is the best movie I have ever seen, it is a must see. The acting was amazing and the special effects were great. The story was so good that I was really sad when it was over. I would not be surprised if this movie won an Oscar, it has every possible category. This movie is my favorite and I would not want anyone to miss it. I think anyone should see this movie because it is a very good movie.
 The opening scene of this film is a bit scary but the rest of the movie is just weird. There is something about the creepiness of this movie that I just can't put my finger on.<br /><br />The movie is about a little girl who is being held captive by her aunt and uncle. After a while she starts to act as if she is being held captive too. I don't understand how this movie isn't more famous. It's weird, creepy, and pretty cool looking.<br /><br />If you want to see a cool movie that is a little bit scary then this is the movie for you. It's a bit weird but I loved it.

 If you've read the book this movie is based on, you know what to expect. One of the best adaptations ever. This movie was incredibly faithful to the book. I am left speechless with how well they captured the book. I've read the book and seen the movie, and I can't tell you how happy I am with this movie. I'm a little disappointed with the casting. I know I know, but I didn't really like the casting. I know it's hard to find the right people. I'm not sure who I would have cast. But, I've been seeing it on TV and it's amazing. The casting was pretty close to the book. It was my favorite movie of last year. I'm not sure what else to say. It's just incredible. I love it.

*** This review may contain spoilers *** I actually was really looking forward to this movie. I was sorry to hear that it was a huge flop. I heard it was supposed to be a good movie. I know it's a drama and not a comedy, but I'm not that big of a fan of drama. I
 I found this movie on a long drive to the mountains, and being a sucker for anything with horses I had to watch it. The movie is not very good, but it is fun, and good at times. In fact, it is really a fun movie, if you are a horse fan. The movie has a lot of comedy, and is a good story, with a lot of good, fun, action scenes, and a good ending. If you are a horse person, and looking for a good movie, I would recommend this one.

 "The Great Muppet Caper" has a great cast. Besides the carnival owner, who is the mastermind behind the whole caper, the cast includes: "Lovable" Larry (Frank Oz), a plumber who goes on a date with Miss Piggy (Pamela Harrison), the cute little girl who is also the star of many of the movie's songs, and is played by Jeanine Tesori, "Lovable" Larry's boss, a blind man who is played by Steve Martin, and another plumber who is played by John Cleese. The real star of the movie is the carnival, which is played by the New York City Opera. The Carnival is very fun, and very entertaining. It is a wonderful diversion from the usual kind of movies starring Frank Sinatra, or other actors with a big name. The biggest problem with the movie is the use of the carnival as just a backdrop. Too much time is spent in the background, and not enough time is spent in the foreground, where you can feel the fun of the movie.<br /><br />One of the best things about "The Great Muppet Caper" is the soundtrack. The music is mostly done by the New York
 If you think "The Godfather" is the greatest movie ever made, you need to see "The Godfather Part II". It is the best sequel ever made. It is much better than the original. Of course, it has been awhile since I saw the original, so I can't compare it to the original. But if you haven't seen the original, you really should. It's a classic. Now, as for "Part II", it is amazing. It's even more intense and dramatic than the first part. And, it has its own clever little touches that I loved. For example, when he is talking to Connie's father, he goes right to playing with the chains like he did with his father. It's very clever, and really adds to the suspense. I also liked the way it ended. It was a good ending. Personally, I think it is the best ending of any other movie. It just wouldn't be the same without the end title. And, I also like the little things that happen in the end. For example, when he is leaving the restaurant, he takes the chair off the table, and puts it in the backseat. It just shows that he is going to take care of
 ...is one of the most memorable comedies of all time. It's a hilarious parody of the romantic-comedy genre, which is a genre which this film is directly parodying. This movie has it all, from the over-the-top acting to the over-the-top situations, to the over-the-top dialogue, to the over-the-top singing, to the over-the-top narration, to the over-the-top horribly bad puns, to the over-the-top terrible puns, to the over-the-top awful puns, to the over-the-top awful puns about awful puns, to the over-the-top awful puns about awful puns about awful puns, to the over-the-top awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns, to the over-the-top awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns about awful puns
 I think this is one of the only movies I've ever seen where the cinematography and editing is so effective that it makes me forget the plot and just enjoy the film as a visual experience. The scene where the two characters are walking in the desert and the camera moves around them as if it's a bird flying around them is very subtle and I can't remember it being done that well in any other movie. The music and the shots towards the end are very effective, too... the way the camera changes angles and the music changes, too.

Overall, the plot makes no sense and the characters are so dumb (in a good way) that it's hard to take it seriously, but it's a very enjoyable film.

 This film is one of the best I've ever seen. It's a story of a guy who has the power to see the future, which could be very good or very bad. He's got the power to change things, but he doesn't use it. He's not a good or bad guy, he's just an ordinary guy. He stays an ordinary guy, but he has the potential to change the world. He's very good at his job and he's also good at making people happy. He makes it a point to keep an eye on his things, because he's always afraid he might loose them. One day a beautiful girl comes into his life, but the only problem is that she's the daughter of an evil witch who wants to kill him. Do they make love or do they fight? This film is very good, but it's also very sad.

 I have enjoyed this movie very much.I like the way the director portrayed the people in the story. I find it quite enjoyable to see the young people living in a small town and their efforts to make some money. They are like a family to me, and I want to see them all get together and develop a friendship. I like the way the girl,Ina, is not afraid to stand up for herself and for what is right. I like the way she does not let any one push her around,and the way she does not back down from a fight. It is a good movie.

**spoiler alert** The ending of the movie was a little sad. I like it when the two young people are getting married,and the old people are there to help them get started.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story.

Starring: Juliette Binoche, Cate Blanchett, Christoph Waltz, David Thewlis, Mark Strong, Alec Newman, John Hurt, and Geoffrey Rush
 The Good Shepherd is a powerful film about the lengths that some people will go to for power, money and success. The story is centered around FBI Agent Jack Crawford (Robert De Niro) and his search for the truth behind the murder of his friend, CIA Agent Tom Bishop (Sean Penn). The story is told from the viewpoint of a number of characters, including Crawford, his wife Claire (Robin Wright Penn), Bishop's wife Cynthia (Catherine Keener), Bishop's boss Tony (Ed Harris), Crawford's mentor Harry S. (Al Pacino) and the many women who make up Bishop's life. Each of these players has his or her own secret agenda, and as the story progresses, the viewer sees how these secrets influence the course of events. The film is a fascinating look at the personal lives of other people, and it's a great film for those who are interested in how politics and the government work. The Good Shepherd is also a great film for those interested in the power that money and wealth can give to certain people. The Good Shepherd is a film that is both moving and powerful, and a great film to see once.

8/10

The Good Shepherd is rated PG-13 for language, violence
 I saw this movie when it first came out. I enjoyed it a lot more than the movie it was based on, the book. I think the movie is well done, the story is well told. I recommend this movie for people who enjoy a good story and for people who enjoy movies that are done well.

 I love this movie.<br /><br />I remember seeing it when it first came out, long ago, and I was never able to get it out of my head. I think that's why it's one of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />It's a simple story, of some poor kid who lives in a bad area, who gets caught stealing a car, and ends up getting his head bashed in by some thugs, and after that, he becomes the leader of the neighborhood. But he's still a kid, and he wants to make some friends, so he goes to an orphanage, and it's at this point where the movie really gets good.<br /><br />The movie shows the life of this kid, and how he learns to deal with what he's been through. It's also about how he learns to deal with life as an adult.<br /><br />This movie is such a great one, it's a classic.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />9/10

I am not sure the point of the movie, but it is a great movie nonetheless.<br /><br />
 This is an excellent film which is beautifully shot and edited and the acting is of a very high standard. The film is based on the true story of a young woman who was the sole survivor of a plane crash in the Andes in 1972. This film is very different to the usual Hollywood film in that it is filmed in black and white, the story is not driven by action but by the human emotions of the characters and there is no clear answer as to what happened to the plane. The story is very compelling and leaves the viewer wanting to know more. I think the film is better as a whole and would not be as successful if it were edited differently which is a shame because it is a very good film.

4.0 out of 5 stars The worst film I ever saw, but I loved it! Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I must admit that I was a bit wary of watching this film. It's one of those 'must see' films that's been described as the best film of 2001. But I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It's really not a great film and the acting is awful. The only actor, I think, who gives a good performance is David Carradine. I'm normally
 This film is a wonderful tribute to the pioneers of the silent film. It shows the struggles of being a pioneer. In the beginning it is very hard to deal with all of the challenges associated with making a movie, but it is so rewarding when you succeed. It also shows how a silent film is different from a sound film. It shows how a silent film is made. It is a beautiful documentary, that captures the imagination of the viewer. It is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again. I highly recommend this film.

1.0 out of 5 stars Silent Film Pioneer\, or What? Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I have always enjoyed silent film, so I was really looking forward to this DVD. After watching the film, I'm still trying to figure out what it is that I just watched. The film consists of a series of photos, interspersed with black and white and color film clips. The sound used is not only extremely low, but the sound that is heard is often the same sound over and over again. The person with the most vocal role is the person who is narrating the film. I'm not sure what this film is trying to say, but I don't

 I watched this movie last night. I was expecting it to be awful, but it turned out to be a great movie. It is a little slow, but I really liked the ending. It is about a boy who gets pushed around by his parents and brother, until he discovers that he has super powers. The movie has some good performances, and the special effects were very good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes superhero movies. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10. I saw this movie at the local Blockbuster.

The movie is good, and I think that is the main reason why it is so successful. The last few minutes of the movie are very confusing, but the way that the movie ends is the way that it should end. The movie is supposed to be funny and it sure is funny, especially at the end. The way that the movie ends makes you want to rewatch it just to see how it ends. The movie is very funny, and the way that it makes you laugh throughout the entire movie is great. The movie is a little slow at the beginning, but as you go along the movie it picks up and you get more into the movie. I really like the way that they set the

 The movie is about a boy who is obsessed by the idea of living in another world. He has a computer that he can use to go into a virtual world. He goes into this world and meets a girl. The plot of the movie is about how he tries to get her to fall in love with him. The movie is not that bad. I personally found it a good movie. The characters were good and the plot was great. It was not plotless. I liked how the boy was never really sure what to do. I would recommend this movie to others.

 This is a very interesting film, with wonderful actors, great locations, and a fascinating plot. The director, Alain Corneau, did a great job of building up the tension, and giving us a plot that made us want to keep watching. There are some parts of the plot that are a bit odd, but the overall plot is very interesting and the acting is great. I would highly recommend this film. It is very different from most other films that I have seen, as it is a murder mystery, as well as a love story, and a bit of a mystery/thriller, and a documentary. I am very excited to see how the next two parts of the film turn out, and I hope that to see more of the same.

 I first watched this film at the age of 17 and was amazed at the sophistication of what was accomplished in this film. I first saw this film in the early 60s and was amazed at the sophisticated acting and the realistic scenes of the people involved. The story is about a playboy who makes a deal with the devil to keep his wife from cheating on him. He then takes her to the underworld and makes a deal with the devil to have his wife back. But after his wife is returned to him, he is left with a lot of guilt and a lot of questions. This film has been rated as one of the best films of all time and I agree. I have seen this film over thirty times and each time it has been as good as the first time. The acting by the three main actors is outstanding and the story is wonderfully written. The characters are very human and believable and you can really feel their emotions. The story is very well told and the acting is so good that you feel that you are part of the story. I highly recommend this film to anyone. I will never get tired of watching it.

 This film is the best film in the world. It is very interesting, with a good plot, lots of action and funny scenes. I saw it in the cinema, and I can't wait to see it again. I love it and I can't stop talking about it. The only thing I didn't like is that there are so many films that are as good as this one. This film is a masterpiece and I am sure that everybody will like it. I give it 10 points and I think that this film is a must see.

 I was so excited to see this movie. I was a big fan of the manga and thought that the film would be a faithful adaptation. However, I was disappointed. I found some of the changes and differences between the manga and the film to be unnecessary and quite jarring.<br /><br />The story of the manga and the film are extremely similar except that in the film, the character Yohji is much more brooding, withdrawn and rebellious and the rest of the cast are more "dominant". The manga version of Yohji was much more likeable and had a more light hearted and funny side to him. It was also very difficult to see his character as a fighter in the film. He was angry and violent in the manga and I think it was much more effective. <br /><br />There are also some major differences between the manga and the film. In the film, there are a lot more characters and the storyline is more complicated. The film was also much more violent and gory. The film's storyline and characters are all very similar to the manga. The film, especially the ending, is also very similar to the manga. The ending, in which the character Yohji is killed by
 A great, entertaining movie which is bound to find a following. The story is a familiar one which we have all seen before and the film has been done better in other films, but it is still an entertaining and fun movie to watch. The characters are well-drawn and the actors work well together. The humor is refreshing and the movie is a joy to watch. It is funny in spots, but never gets too gross or vulgar. The one thing that really makes this movie is the soundtrack. The songs are not great, but they are appropriate and fit the movie. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, I would suggest checking out this one. You won't be disappointed.

I was very skeptical about this film when I first heard about it. I have seen so many movies with the same story line, that I didn't think I could like this film. I was wrong. I absolutely loved this movie. The cast is great, the story is interesting and it has a lot of the stuff I like in it. I like comedies in which the characters are not defined by their looks
 The film is excellent and well worth seeing. Angela Lansbury is wonderful and the supporting cast is excellent. The story and the dialogue are superb. I watched the entire film in one sitting. I would not recommend this film to young children, due to the movie's sexually explicit scenes. I would recommend the movie for mature audiences only.

This film is about a woman who is called from a nursing home to take care of her sister. Her sister starts to go senile, and the main character makes a decision to take her in and care for her. There are a lot of twists and turns in this film, and you don't quite know who to trust and who is telling the truth.

 I love this movie, it is a very emotional story with a marvelous soundtrack. The story is about a young boy, who dies in an automobile accident, and must spend some time in a kind of hellish dimension, where he sees the people who he had wronged in this life, and they are punished in the same way that they had treated him. It is a very unconventional movie, but I think it is very effective and I would recommend it to everyone.

A Thousand Acres (1992) Excellent documentary about the movie "The Grapes of Wrath" 7 April 2003 This documentary is about the making of the movie "The Grapes of Wrath", and it has interviews with many people who made the movie, and with some of the actors who played in it. It is very interesting to see how the movie was conceived and how it was filmed, and it is also very informative about why the movie was made and what it means.

 This movie had the potential to be a good movie. Unfortunately, it was just not meant to be.<br /><br />The story was a good one, but it was not well executed. Too many characters, some of which were good actors but had no job to do. Some of the people didn't have anything to do at all. The movie was too long and dragged at times. The editing was sloppy as well.<br /><br />The acting was good and the characters well developed. The problem is that most of the characters were not developed enough. They could have been developed into better characters, but they weren't. Overall, this movie was just not good enough to be worth the time and effort.

Great idea, but needs a lot of work

Author: The-Gadgeteer from United States

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This movie had a great idea, but the execution was more like a bad idea. While the concept is a good one, the movie has a lot of problems.<br /><br />The first problem
 I'd been waiting since the mid-1950s for a good Bogart film wherein he played a hard-boiled, cynical, tough-guy private dick. The best of these was "High Sierra," but Bogart had been close to the mark with "The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon" (the latter, with the help of Lauren Bacall, had a sigh of relief among those who felt that Bogart could not carry a film on his own with out an adequate leading lady). What was needed was a film that was noir enough to capture the hard-boiled style, yet had a quality of moral ambiguity that would make it palatable to many, if not all, critics.<br /><br />"The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon" are both of the period. The latter is interesting in that it's a film that is much more interested in Bogart's relationship with the detective, and the latter's relationship with his boss, than in his relationship with the woman. The former is more interested in the relationship between these three, and the latter more in the relationship between the woman and the detective (although the latter's relationship with her employer, the detective, is also important
 I believe this movie is great, but it is not the best. It is still a great movie though and there is no doubt that this movie is worth watching. It is funny and romantic, it has great characters and it has a very good plot. If you are looking for a movie that is funny and romantic and that has a great plot, then this movie is for you too. I was very glad that I watched this movie and I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes romantic movies.

 I saw this movie when it came out in the theatres. I had just started working at a video store and thought the movie looked cool and picked it up. I haven't seen it since, but like the title says, I enjoyed it. This movie has a hit and miss feeling to it. It starts off really funny and interesting, and you don't know what to expect. If you're looking for a good time and something to watch that's entertaining and original, I would recommend this movie.

At the end of the day, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's not terrible either. It's just good, and that's what makes it good.

 Even though this film is very rare, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. There's enough drama to keep it interesting, and enough comedy to keep it interesting. The main guy, John Candy, is just hilarious, and the second guy, Sean Cunningham, plays his best friend so well. I don't know what happened to this movie, but I'm glad that it was made. It's a classic.

My name is John Candy. You probably won't remember me because I'm only 16 years old. I play a character named Jason Good on the show "The Kids in the Hall", but that doesn't make me special. I have a lot of other stuff going on. I'm in a band called "The Candy Butchers", and we're on tour right now. On this tour, I'm learning to play the harmonica, which is a funny way to learn to play. I think it's a lot of fun. We played our first gig at the Phoenix in Toronto, which was very exciting for us. We love making music. Sometimes I get a little bored of it, because it's not very glamorous. I think we're going to go on tour in a year or so. We're
 As a HUGE fan of the original film and the television series, I had to see this. I found it to be a very enjoyable film, and was thrilled to see that the original cast members all returned for this one. The movie seemed to be very true to the original, and is probably the best version of the story that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The best part of this film is the way that Doug McClure plays the character of the original hero. He is just a perfect actor. The way he portrays the hero is so different from the guy in the original film, yet similar enough that it is believable.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the story. It is not as predictable as the original film. It seemed to be more rooted in reality, and seemed more like a story that could actually happen to anybody.<br /><br />I was glad to see that they brought back the original cast members, but was disappointed that the villains were not played by the original actors. I would have liked to have seen the actors who played the villains in the original film return to play those roles. I think that the actors who played them in this film did a great job, but I just preferred
 I saw this movie at the IFFR and I can't stop thinking about it. I think that the young actors are amazing, and I especially like the lead actress. She is so sweet and charming. She reminds me of the young Natalie Portman of the early 2000s, which is a great compliment. The story is unique and engaging.<br /><br />I also liked the cinematography and the music. The dialog was good and the screenplay was well-written. I recommend this movie to everybody, especially the young.

Sabrina's Coming of Age

Author: (lmstran@yahoo.com) from United States

4 October 2005



Sabrina is a coming of age film for this generation of kids. I have to admit that I really had no idea what was going on with the plot until the end, but the acting and the story holds your interest throughout. I think the 3 young leads were great, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them grow up over the course of the film. The story is not intense, but the kids are so innocent and sweet, you
 In a film, when the audience is presented with something new and different, they will naturally pay attention. This is the case with The Film Formula. Instead of being a traditional documentary, it is presented in the form of a "found footage" film, which is a style that is not as popular as it once was, but is still very much alive and well. The film revolves around the story of a documentary film crew and their journey to a remote island where they are to film a documentary. As I mentioned, this film is different from most documentaries, and it is a very clever way of telling the story. In most documentaries, the camera crew is a normal person who happens to be filming, but with The Film Formula, the camera crew is a group of filmmakers working together to produce a film. The filmmakers are the main characters, and their stories are told and analyzed in a very interesting way. Another interesting aspect of the film is the way it is shot. The camera is placed inside the characters, and at times, we are treated to the camera's point of view. These two aspects of the film are not seen in the same way in a traditional documentary, and the film is much more entertaining and entertaining to watch.<br /
 I think it's a bit silly to see this movie as a sequel to the original. It's more of a spin-off about a new character and the people around him. They're all great, but this doesn't really matter because the movie is really about the main character and his journey to new heights of success. The people around him are just there to give him more personality and a new story to tell. The plot is great and it's a lot of fun to watch and laugh at. It's not that much of a serious plot, it's more of a story about how one man can achieve everything he wants even though he doesn't get the recognition he's entitled to. But I think the best part is the soundtrack. It's great and it's one of the best scores ever created. The sound is great, the songs fit with the movie perfectly and you can definitely tell that the theme of the movie is the music. It's just a great movie and I highly recommend it.

8.0/10

 A true story about an extraordinary woman who rose from poverty to become the first woman to fly in an airplane. This is the story of Amelia Earhart and her solo flight from New York to California. There are numerous movies and books about this woman, but this is the first I've seen that is based on the real story. It was a little slow to get started, but the action picked up quick. Some of the acting was unbelievable. It was hard to believe that the woman in the movie was the same woman in real life. The director did a good job of capturing the feeling of the time period.

If you love aviation and you don't mind a bit of a slow build to the story, this one is well worth a look. If you are in a rush, it's not the best choice.

 I'm sorry to say this is not going to be a good review as I'm no expert on this subject. But I did see it, and it really is a very good film. I hope there is more to come.<br /><br />It is a well-made film, the acting was good, the storyline was well thought out, it was well directed and it had some wonderful scenes. The set design was top notch. The effects were done smoothly, and the effects really did help to make the film a success. The music was good, and I even liked the cinematography. I can't really give a lot more praise.<br /><br />I do feel the film was not given enough time to continue though. I can't help feeling it was rushed a bit, and it should have been longer, and it should have had a better ending. But that is just my opinion.<br /><br />I give this film an 8.7 out of 10.

 I haven't seen this movie in a very long time. I remember watching it when i was little and that was the day my love for the movie was born. I saw this movie for the first time when i was about 8 years old and the next time i watched it was when i was a teenager. I loved this movie so much that i was disappointed when i realized i had forgotten the plot. The movie is so great i can't imagine why it's not a classic. The plot could have been a little better because the movie is a little too long. If you can get past the length and you like cute movies this is the one for you. I really love this movie and every time i see it i can't help but smile.

I had to search for a copy of this movie for so long, i couldn't believe that i didn't know it sooner. i remember when i first saw it, I was just a kid and i slept over at my friend's house. We were watching movies, and this one came on and i loved it. I had to see it again, so
 I've read many reviews of this film, and they all seem to have much the same comment. Many people have said that it's a very poor film, that the acting is awful, that the film is racist, sitcom-like, etc. I disagree with most of these comments. The acting was not bad at all, and I agree the film is well-paced, funny and clever. This film is an excellent satire of modern African-American culture, and does it well. I enjoyed it a great deal. I disagree with those people who say it's very racist. There are many characters in the film that are not black or white, such as the "nanny" who is white, and the main character's white friend. I also don't see how this film is sitcom-like. The main character's account of his family is very realistic. This is a very good film that I recommend to both black and white alike.

 I went to see this movie for the first time about 1 month ago. I have never seen a movie that has ever made me laugh so much, and cry so much! It is a must see for everyone, who is an animal lover, or anyone who loves a good laugh! I will go back to the movie again and again, and I hope that many more people do too. I give the movie 10 out of 10 stars.

I loved it and my family did too, and we all hated to leave.

I would give the movie 10 out of 10 stars if I could.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, God Bless you, and thank you again.

And I love the movie, and I will make sure anyone I know sees it.

Thank you, and I hope that you keep doing what you do, and I will keep doing what I do, and I hope that your family loves you, and loves you, and loves you, and loves you, and loves you.

Thank you, again.

Sincerely,

Roberta B.

 I have to say I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie. I have some friends who have seen it and loved it but I just didn't get the appeal. Then I saw that it was playing at the theater near me so I decided to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the movie. I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away by it. I was laughing and crying at the same time. The acting was very good and the story is so creative. I really enjoyed it and I hope there is a sequel.<br /><br />By the way, I've never watched an episode of Scrubs, so I don't know if this is similar to that. But if it is, you definitely don't need to watch that because this movie is so much better.

I agree, the acting was great and the story was good, but I don't think it was very funny. I found it to be a little slow and boring. The movie is rated R, and I was laughing a lot, so I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't find it funny. I think the title
 This movie is great: It's so cool! I love the story, the music and the characters. And it's not just a movie for kids! It's for everybody: Kids, Adults and even the people who have problems like me!<br /><br />It's a good example for everyone: If you want to be a musician, you have to play your instrument & sing. If you want to be a dancer, than you have to dance.<br /><br />It's a really good movie! So if you are a kid, or an adult and you want to know what is a real rock n roll band, watch this movie! You'll probably have the same feeling as me, that you want to play a guitar, sing or dance.<br /><br />And remember: If you want to be a famous rock n roll star, you have to work hard. And you need a good manager. So watch the movie!<br /><br />See you in the movie!

Absolutely Awesome!!!!!!, 30 July 2006


 I read the book when I was young and I was so excited when I found out the movie was going to be made. I remember watching it in the theater and thinking it was so true to the book. I was so excited to watch it again when I saw it on the big screen. It was just as good the second time around. I was so amazed that they did it as well as they did. It was one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm looking forward to the sequel. I hope they do it as well as the first one. I can't wait to see it.

*Note* I've read a lot of the reviews about the movie and I would like to say that for a lot of people it seems like it's about the music and not about the relationships. The songs are great, but it's about the relationships between the characters. Thanks for reading.

 The movie is great. You see some of the best scenes in the movie in the trailer. I even tried to buy it on DVD but didn't find it at a store. The movie is also very short, I mean it is only one hour and forty five minutes. So if you have time, you have to watch it. The movie is about a boy named Jake (played by Keanu Reeves) who wants to be a singer. All he has to do is be in a band and he will be part of the band of rockstars. Yeah, but he doesn't have any talent,

only when a girl named Alex (played by Alexandra Daddario) meets him and he finds out he is a good singer, he will be famous. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

 This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I find it very hard to believe that it has been out for some time, but I am grateful that it is. It is one that you will never forget and it will stay with you forever. The acting is excellent and all of the characters are well portrayed. I am not sure if there are any other movies as fine as this one. I love all of the characters and I think they are all very good in the movie. I find myself getting very emotional at certain moments in the movie. I love all of the characters and I think they are very good. I think it is a very good movie and I am glad that I have seen it. I am very happy that I have seen it and I will never forget it.

 I purchased this DVD to give to my boyfriend as a birthday gift, and I was a little disappointed at first, but that was due to the fact that the film is dubbed in English and the cast is almost entirely Asian (including the characters' names). I was surprised that there were no subtitles for the film, but after watching it, I totally understand why there are none. The story is about a young Japanese woman named Maki (played by Chinami Nishimura) who moves to America (Manhattan) to pursue a career in fashion design. She is determined to make something of herself and doesn't let her small town upbringing (Japan) make her feel inferior to everyone around her. Her life is thrown into turmoil when she meets a man named Takao (played by Iwanaga Mitsuo) and falls in love with him. After some problems with her mother (played by Katsu Shihomi) and her friends (played by Natsuna Watanabe and Erika Koo) she has to decide if she should let Takao go, or if she falls in love with him. The film is a very cute and sweet romance, and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it very much. I would recommend this film
 I was at first skeptical when I heard this was an adaptation of a comic book. It seemed to me that they had just taken the plot of a comic book, put it on film, and then tried to make it a movie.<br /><br />But then I watched it. I was surprised at how faithful it was to the comic book. The story line was still there, and I think the acting was very good. Some of the special effects were a little cheesy, but overall I liked this movie. I would recommend it to any comic book fan.

 This is a good movie with some very good performances. Jeff Daniels is great as the patriarch of a family dealing with a serious medical diagnosis. And Morgan Freeman gives an excellent performance as the father of the family -- he seems to have a great deal of respect for Daniels' character. The story is good -- it does not feel like a "made for TV" movie, but it is a good story well told. The film is set in the South, and it does capture some of the characteristics of the place. (The film is set in a small town in Louisiana, but it is a fictional town.) I like this film and recommend it to people who like a good movie that is well acted and well told.

 I don't understand all the negative comments that were left on this film. Yes, it is a typical trashy chick flick, but the movie was great. I liked the twist at the end. It was a great story line and the acting was superb. If you liked any of the other movies that were classified as chick flicks, then you'll like this one. I thought the script was very well written, and the scenery was great. We rented it from the video store, and it was only $2.50. I think it was worth it. I would recommend this movie to others.

Sex and violence, a little of both

Author: bjr-14 from Los Angeles

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This is a very typical Hollywood movie, with sex and violence, a lot of it. The story is about a young woman who is kidnapped and has to survive in a small town with the help of a small group of people. The story is interesting and the acting is great. The only thing that was a little strange is the fact
 I really loved this movie. It was absolutely fun from beginning to end. The humor was unique and well-written. There were times when I had to laugh out loud due to the absurd situations and characters that were portrayed. The only thing that I felt was not a part of the movie was the opening. I felt that that part was a little too long and I would have preferred it to start with the "Honeymooners" opening instead. It was still a great movie though and I really would recommend it.

<br /><br />The only negative comment I have for the movie is that it was too short. I would have loved to have seen more of the characters, especially that blonde waitress. That was just a little too much information to give up in one sitting.

<br /><br />I was happy to see that there was a sequel. I know that the movie was not a big deal to anyone else but it made me happy that I could go back and watch the first movie. I also found it interesting that the movie was made by the same people that made the first one. Obviously, they are talented and they did a great job with this. I would definitely watch more of their
 I had a fondness for the movie. It is a very well done film. The scenes are well shot. The acting is pretty good. The brother and sister make a good couple. The drama is good. I like the way the couple is shown to be very close even though the brother is living with his mom. The movie is a good little piece of work.

I do have a few problems with the movie. I think the script is a bit weak. I think the actors did a good job with the material they were given but they probably could've done better. The first time I saw the movie I didn't like the ending. It is a little bit of a cliffhanger. I would've liked to see more of the sisters life. I think it would be good to show her doing things like a normal teenager. I think the movie was good but I think it could've been a bit better. The ending was a little bit of a letdown.

I think the director did a good job with the movie. I think the film is well shot. I think the movie is well acted. I think the editing is very good. I think the music is good. I think the cinematography is

 I first saw this film on the United Kingdom's Channel 4, and I was a bit surprised to find it had been banned by the BBC. I had read that it was a "controversial" film, and it was supposedly banned by the BBC because of its anti-war stance, which I disagree with. I think that the BBC's banning of this film is a result of the fact that it shows the true nature of the war in Iraq, and the fact that it shows the disgusting corruption of the US government in Iraq. The US President is shown to be just as corrupt as Tony Blair and the British Prime Minister. The film also shows the incompetence of the US soldiers, who are shown to be physically and mentally useless. The film also shows the true nature of the Iraqi people, who are shown as being just as friendly as the American people. My overall opinion of the film is that it shows the corruption and incompetence of the US government in Iraq, and it also shows the true nature of the Iraqi people.

This film was a very interesting film to watch, and I am glad that I watched it. The film was very interesting because it showed the true nature of the US government's involvement in Iraq. I think that this
 This is a very good movie. It is a simple movie, with a very good story and a good plot. The movie is about a young girl that finds a wallet that was lost way back in time. She decides to go back in time, and to take the wallet. She goes back through time and meets a man that is also a time-traveler. He decides to help her find the wallet, and she goes with him to the past. The movie is about her finding the wallet and getting it back, and about her finding out who the man is. The movie is very good and worth watching.

 I saw this movie for the first time on the Sci-Fi Channel this morning. I was surprised. I expected to see a movie that was much better. I think it was because I left the movie theater with the idea that I didn't think it was that good. But I was wrong. This movie was much better than I thought. It has a lot of beautiful scenery and the way the scenery changes is different and interesting. The story was a bit strange but I liked it. The characters were well developed and they did a good job of making the characters different. It is hard to tell the difference between love and hate but I think that is what the movie is all about. The characters do a good job of showing both kinds of emotions. I think the movie was a good movie. The actors did a good job. The music was good. I was surprised that the ending was not a happy ending. It was a good movie. I would recommend it. I would also recommend it to my friends.

 After seeing this movie I can see why it is so popular. The story is well written, easy to follow and the characters are very likable.<br /><br />The cast is absolutely fantastic. This movie is funny, charming and everything you would expect from a classic Disney movie. The actors are all great, but I was especially impressed with the way they played the young characters. They are so believable and make you really care about what happens to them. I also really liked the way the movie ended. It wasn't over the top and it left you with a smile on your face. It is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. It is a feel good, funny and nostalgic movie.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9.5/10.

 This is a beautiful movie. I had never heard of it until it was recommended by a friend. It's about a Korean woman who's forced to marry a Korean man who she hates; as soon as she arrives in America, she leaves her husband. As you can guess, the two countries themselves are very different in many ways, and the film captures this very well. The acting is fantastic, and the cinematography is stunning. I would definitely watch this film again, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a beautiful, heart-breaking film.

 I was somewhat skeptical of this particular movie when I first heard about it...how does a movie about a high school basketball team deal with themes of racism and prejudice against the black community? However, with the recent death of high school basketball star Michael Oher, who was (like in the movie) a part of a homeless, inner-city team and the tragic shooting death of the young, gifted athlete Jett Travolta, I felt that this film would be a poignant, yet honest depiction of what it is like to be a black teen in America today.<br /><br />First off, I must say that I love the way that this movie was shot. The film was shot in a documentary style, with only occasional use of traditional cinematography, which makes it much more engaging and authentic. The two main characters were played by two great, young actors, both of whom were excellent in the film. I especially liked the character of the coach, played by John Cusack. He was very natural and believable, and he really helped to carry this movie.<br /><br />The story was also very compelling. The main characters were definitely sympathetic, and I was very interested in how the movie was going to end
 I have to agree with the other reviewers. This is a great movie. It is definitely a tear-jerker. I cried at some parts. It is very funny in parts, and scary in other parts. It is a great family movie for all ages. I watched it as a baby, and watched it again as a 13 year old. It is a must see. I would recommend it to any one.

I would give this movie 10 out of 10.

This is a movie that you will want to watch again and again.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

(I am not a huge fan of Disney movies, but this is one of the few that I will go back to again and again.)

What a Wonderful World (1937) The perfect movie to put on when you are sad. 1 July 2004 I have to say that this movie is my favorite. I am not a fan of musicals, but I love this movie.

 Well, I'll admit to being a little surprised that the movie was so popular. It's supposed to be a low budget horror movie, but looks like a big budget Michael Bay movie. The special effects are very good, the acting is good and the movie is exciting, but again, I'll admit to being surprised. I think a lot of people were surprised because the movie has an interesting story, but it's not just about zombies, but about a young man who is a good citizen and has to save the world from bad people. I would definitely recommend this movie, especially to those who like good story and action.

5.0 out of 5 stars Not your typical zombie film. Format: DVD Quite possibly the most original zombie film to date. Sure, they kill and eat the "living" but they do it in a very modern way. The film begins with a scene of a typical high-school prom, when suddenly a huge explosion rips through the air and the young man, who has been given the power to stop the impending apocalypse by a mysterious stranger, finds himself on a deserted island with his girlfriend, his best friend and the school's principle. As he tries to get the answers he needs to save his
 I quite liked this fine adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play. I think the film does a good job of capturing the spirit of the original play. I especially liked the two principal performances by the two young leads, Peter Fonda and Anna Karina. Karina is the more serious but equally effective character. The young Fonda is a wonderful little actor and he is perfect for the role of the young, idealistic lover of the older, cynical courtesan. The film has a good supporting cast, including the always appealing John Vernon, the always dependable George C. Scott, the always wonderful Mia Farrow, who was never better, and the always excellent Burl Ives who, as ever, gives a wonderful performance as the cynical, yet lovable old roué. There is a wonderful scene where Karina and Fonda, both in the hallucinatory state of opium, are dancing in a ballroom and Scott, Ives and Farrow are playing cards and are suddenly engulfed in a billowing cloud of smoke, to the accompaniment of the song "Chopsticks." This film is a fine example of the kind of quality film that studios like MGM and Warner Bros. used to release, and it still holds up many years later
 I only wish I could have seen this at the time it was released. It was a time, about 30 years ago, when the movie studios could still find the money to make films like this. Unfortunately, today's movie making is often very disappointing. This was a great movie that had me in tears at the end. The truth about Korea's occupation of the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula is that it was not about war, but about the land. This movie does an excellent job of showing the true nature of Korea's occupation. The movie is not complete, as it leaves out a lot of details, but it is a good introduction to the past.

The movie only touches briefly on this history, but it gives a good idea of what it was like to live under Korea's rule. It also shows that the US and other countries were not just wrong in their views of Korea, but also in their treatment of the victims of this occupation.

I highly recommend this movie.

Great movie about the Korean War and the Korean
 Even though I had seen this film before, I never realized how much it would mean to me. It is one of those films that stays with you forever. I saw it for the first time in 1985 and it is still one of my favorites. I know there are many people who do not care for this film, but I believe that they are missing out on a beautiful film. I have to admit that I fell in love with Nicolas Cage in this film. His character was so believable and so unlike anyone you have ever seen before. If you are looking for a film with wonderful actors and a beautiful story, then this is the film for you. I highly recommend it!

2.0 out of 5 stars Bad, but not without its charms Format: DVD | Verified Purchase Wow. I had no idea that this movie was quite as bad as it was. I liked the idea of it, of course, but I was completely disappointed. My main complaint is that there is no character development. It seems like the movie was made up of short bits of information about each character. This made it hard for me to empathize with anyone. I also thought the music was incredibly annoying. I'm a huge fan of the director,
 This film is a great example of how you can use a bit of imagination to make a great film.<br /><br />The images of the moon and the water were great, as was the score. The best part is when the bird flies on the moon and the images are reflected on the water. The images are also reflected in the sea. The whole film is a reflection of the moon. The film is also a metaphor for the struggles of the human spirit. We see the struggle of the bird, who wants to cross the sea in order to find his mate. We also see the struggle of the scientist, who wants to prove that the moon is not a natural phenomenon.<br /><br />One of the best scenes in this film is the final scene, when the sea is calm and the moon is full. It is a metaphor for the achievement of man and the achievement of the human spirit, which only shines with the light of the moon.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.

 I just love this movie, how it was filmed, the way it was played and the way it was written. I love the humor, I love the music and I love the story. I have seen it maybe 6 or 7 times, and I still laugh out loud when I see it. I love it!

I would love to see it again, in 30 years.

Thank you, director, and thanks to the whole cast and crew! You did a fabulous job.

I would love to see this movie again, or one of the other movies that the Auteurs have made.

Thank you again, and a huge thank you to the shop that I found this DVD at.

You guys are great.

Have a nice day, and the best of luck.

 I loved this movie. It's fun, it's fast, and it has a great cast. If you like George Clooney in good old fashioned action roles, then you'll love this movie. It's like a James Bond film without the fancy gadgets. One of the things that I loved about it was that it's in widescreen, and that it's not shot in a really glossy, grainy way. The characters are great, and I love the action scenes. The romping about with a boombox is great fun. The acting is excellent, and I love the evil Russian villain played by Danny D'Amato. It's a fun, action packed film that you could easily watch over and over again.

Man on Fire

20 March 1999

Man on Fire is a terrific movie. It's one of Denzel's best, and I love the way he plays him, as a sort of mercenary who's all about looking after himself and has very little regard for others. The film is set in New Orleans, and the way it's shot really captures the spirit of the city. The plot is standard James Bond
 This movie is a must see. It is pure Americana. The scenery is breathtaking and the characters are unforgettable. The story is simple but the dialogue is crisp and witty. It is John Steinbeck at his best, and it is amazing how he wrote it only 40 years ago. I believe this is a movie to be experienced on the big screen in a theater with the sound up. My wife and I watched the DVD on our living room TV with the sound low, and we were not able to follow the movie. We needed to see it on the big screen.<br /><br />I didn't want to give this movie a ten, because I wanted to give it a ten. It is really that brilliant. I would give this movie a 10 and a half if I could.

<br /><br />I would like to see it again, but I am afraid I would have to rent it again.

<br /><br />I want to watch it again, and I want to watch it with my wife.

<br /><br />I love this movie.

<br /><br />I recommend it to everyone.

 This is a beautiful, touching, and often funny coming-of-age story about a teenage girl living in the suburbs of New York. Blythe Danner plays a rich, upper class, and open-minded mother who gives her daughter everything she ever wanted. In the process, she gradually discovers the true meaning of their relationship. The film builds slowly and has several nice surprises, and I give it a strong 8 out of 10.

The main character is played by the supremely talented and beautiful Jessica Lange, who is one of the best actresses working today. She is also a great actress, and is able to convey pain, emotions, and raw emotions in one scene. Lange's performance is so powerful and believable that it will have you crying by the end of the film.

The movie is also very funny, and will make you laugh out loud at least once. The scene where Blythe plays the guitar and sings, and the scene where she is told by the boy she likes that she is ugly, are both hilarious.

The movie has a great soundtrack, and the music enhances the emotional content of the film.

The movie also has several surprises and emotional moments that will shock you and make
 If you watched the original "The Great Escape" (1963) you will be reminded of it when watching this film. Both films are based around the same story; a group of prisoners are planning a mass escape from a prison in World War 2. Both films have the same cast and the same basic storyline. Both films have the same time and place; the same type of story and a lot of the same scenes. Both films have the same basic plot line. The main actors in these films are very well known. In both films the main character, played by Steve McQueen, is a main character and is involved in the whole story. The main actors in the original "The Great Escape" are Steve McQueen and James Garner. The main actors in this film are Steve McQueen and Pierce Brosnan. Both films have the same time and place; the same type of story and a lot of the same scenes. Both films have the same basic plot line. The main characters in these films are very similar; they are all prisoners, who are planning a mass escape. In both films the characters are involved in the whole story, which explains why they need to escape. The film makers have done a very good job at portraying these films;
 Jhumpa Lahiri's novels are smart and sensitive, and this movie does them justice. The movie is almost word for word from the book, and the actors are very good. I saw this movie years ago, and was impressed by it, but I've seen it again recently, and it stands up just as well now. It's a story about a young girl living in India, working as a photographer's apprentice. She's in love with a young man, and her family is trying to arrange a marriage, but she doesn't want to get married at all. She's a sensitive person, and sensitive to the point of sadness, but she's not a whiner, and she's not a victim. This is a good movie. I recommend it.

5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful, moving, and thought-provoking. Format: DVD Jhumpa Lahiri's most recent novel, The Namesake, was made into a beautifully-shot, well-acted, thought-provoking film. She is one of the most talented and sensitive writers of my generation. The movie is based on her novel, which is only marginally different from her book. The story centers on Ashoke Sen and
 This is a great horror movie. It has some of the best acting I have seen from a horror film. It has classic scenes with crazy killer, killer animals, and killer music. The killer is so scary and the animals are so scary too. It is the funniest movie I have ever seen. It is the first time that I have laughed while watching a horror movie. The ending is great. It is so funny. The best part of the movie is when the girl goes to the house, because that is the best thing that was ever in the movie. It is so funny, and it is the best part of the movie. The plot is great. It is classic and it is a must see. I have seen it twice, and it is so funny. I am sure that you will enjoy it.

Favorite Scene: The best thing in the movie is when the girl goes to the house. It is so funny.

The Grudge (2004) The Grudge 1 is the best horror movie ever. 30 March 2004 - 3 out of 7 users found this review helpful. The Grudge is the best horror movie ever. It is
 For a film that was released in 2003, I had never heard of this movie until a few months ago when I came across it on Netflix. I watched it in 2 sittings, and absolutely loved it. I thought it was well acted, nicely directed, and well written. And I didn't care that the story was cliche' or that it was a remake of a real life story. There are plenty of movies about the murder of a young girl and her aftermath, and this one is a good one to watch. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has seen it, and I would also recommend it to those who are watching it for the first time.

<br /><br />The story is about a teenage girl who is raped and murdered, and the aftermath of the crime. The daughter of the woman who runs the funeral home where the body is held, is on the verge of being released from the home she has been living in. The story goes along with her as she attempts to recover from the trauma of her rape and murder.

<br /><br />It's okay to watch this movie without reading the synopsis, because the story is very compelling and sad. In the story,
 <br /><br />The movie is starting to show the signs of maturity and the director is trying to be a bit more creative by incorporating a lot of symbolism, but the movie still stays true to the spirit of the book. The only difference is that the movie is a lot longer and has a better story. The character development is a lot stronger and the movie is much more enjoyable. <br /><br />The book is a fictionalized version of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The book primarily focuses on the events leading up to the assassination, but the movie focuses on the assassination itself. The movie is also more intense and it's really hard to watch. The book is a little more subtle and the movie's portrayal is much more realistic. The movie is also a lot more graphic and gruesome than the book. The book is a lot more subtle and you really have to pay attention to what is going on. The first half of the book is about the assassination, but the movie doesn't really dive into the details so much, but the movie doesn't go into the details of the assassination itself quite as much as the book does. The movie also feels a lot more real and believable. The book is a fun and
 That is definitely one of the most interesting movies I have seen in a long time. I like the fact that the first part of the movie is mostly about the discussions about the making of the movie, the second part about the making of the movie, and the third part about the making of the movie.<br /><br />As a member of the crew and a friend of the actors, I was really impressed by the movie. The acting is pretty good, especially by the main actor, as well as the casting of the characters. The director did a great job in balancing the stories of each character and bringing the main character of the movie to an end. It was nice to see the actors in the movie not just in one role, but in several roles. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about the making of movies, especially if the movie makers are involved in their own movie.<br /><br />From an American perspective, I would have liked to see a bit more discussion about the American cinema. In fact, I would have like to see more discussion about the American Film industry as a whole. I think it would have been interesting to see this movie in the USA. In fact, I would like to see
 This movie is one of the best that I've seen recently. It's a well made comedy with a good cast and a good script. I'm not sure if it's a comedy, because it's not so funny. But it's a very good movie that's worth watching. The story is pretty simple. It's about a middle-aged man (Sam Rockwell) who lost his job in a car factory and he has to go back to his hometown to stay with his parents. He meets his high school sweetheart (Anna Friel) again and they try to deal with the situation. But he also meets his high school nemesis (Philip Seymour Hoffman) again and they try to deal with their own problems. Sam Rockwell and Anna Friel are great in this movie. They fit perfectly in this movie. Sam Rockwell and Anna Friel get the best performances of their careers. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a good job as well. He's been nominated for an Oscar for this role. And the movie has a good supporting cast with the likes of Jeff Daniels and William Fichtner and Amanda Peet. But this is the movie that I'm talking about. I think that all of the cast do a good job in
 I was in a situation where I had to watch a movie that was incredibly boring.<br /><br />I had to watch "The Ladykillers" for a class. I really had no expectations for the movie, as it seemed like a remake of "The Lady Vanishes." I was just looking for something that wasn't boring, and that's when I came across this movie. I was laughing out loud the whole time.<br /><br />I haven't seen "The Lady Vanishes" yet, but I'm guessing it's the same story.<br /><br />Both movies are good and entertaining, so if possible, watch "The Ladykillers" for a good laugh.<br /><br />9/10.

I love this movie, because it is funny, and it has a great plot.

I think I'll watch it again and again!

The Lady Vanishes (1938) An extremely good movie! 5 June 2005 - 1 out of 3 users found this review helpful. The plot is a little bit similar to "The Lady Vanishes," but that's not a bad thing. <br /
 The story of a couple caught up in a series of seemingly coincidental events, a story which unfolds over a period of 30 years, and which has a very dramatic conclusion. No film has ever made me laugh so much as this one, and there is not a single dull moment in the entire film. The acting is excellent, the director's visual style is unique, the script is intelligent and well-written, the music is of a high standard, the locations are superb, and the whole production is a pleasure to watch. If you haven't yet seen this film, then do yourself a favour and visit the IMDb to read a full review of it, then go and see it. You won't regret it.

The only bad thing is that it's not very original. But I think that's the only thing that's bad about this film.

 "The War Lord" is a high quality historical epic with a lot of action, but it also has its heart in the right place. The film is based on the life of its historical subject, the 19th century German patriot, Carl Heinrich Alexander, who led the Prussian army in a liberation war that was won by the Prussian's against Napoleon's French army. The movie itself has a large cast of well-known actors, including Eric Roberts, David Carradine, John Rhys-Davies, Richard Harris, and a very solid performance by Dennis Hopper as Alexander. The movie's main theme is the question of how much one man can really make a difference in the world. The moral of the story is that a people can only be free when they are willing to sacrifice everything for their freedom, including the lives of their loved ones. The film's historical accuracy is also very high, with a very balanced and accurate portrayal of Alexander's life and achievements. The movie also has a very interesting plot, which I won't give away here, but it is one of my favorites. The film isn't perfect, but it is a very, very good film.

 I think the movie was great, terrific, and I really liked it. The way I saw the movie was like a story, but with a lot of action. It was cool to see a movie about a guy who has to go to a school that gangs rule. The movie was also cool because it was about a hero. The guy who is the hero has to kick the crap out of all the gangs and shit, while he is trying to get the girl. The guy who is the hero is cool because he has a cool name. I think the movie was brilliant, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a cool movie. The way I saw the movie was like a story, but with a lot of action.

 I saw this film for the first time about two years ago at the Oscars. As usual, it was shown in a tiny room and I sat on the edge of my seat, mesmerised by the film. I have seen it several times since and must say that it is one of the truest films I have ever seen. I have seen many films involving the Holocaust, but no one else can tell the story like this.<br /><br />The film is so realistic that it seems like it could actually have happened. The story is based on the diary of a woman "whose life was destroyed by the Holocaust" and is narrated by a woman who has to learn to live again after she is released from a concentration camp. It is a sad story, and it was not easy at all to watch, but it is also a very moving story that will leave the viewer with a lot to think about. <br /><br />The acting is also very good, and I found myself really drawn in by the story, captivated by the film. I will be buying this film in the future for sure.<br /><br />* 10/10

 An excellent film. The cast is outstanding. Rosemary Harris and Ingrid Bergman are superb, and the supporting cast is wonderful. The story is quite good, and the cinematography is excellent. The script is well written, and the film is well directed. The movie also deals with an interesting and important subject: the Holocaust. I'm not Jewish, but I think it is important for people to understand this topic. And it is also important for people to see this movie, so that we can understand the aftermath of such an event.

The film was very well received during its time, and I think it is even better now.

I have read a previous review on this film which said that it was boring. I disagree. I thought it was very interesting and thought provoking. I can't imagine what it would be like to be in the shoes of the people in this movie, but I am sure it would be horrible.

If you are looking for a good movie, this is it.

8/10.

Also, I would recommend the book, The Long Good Friday. It is also good.

 I have been to many shows at the Cactus Club and this was my favorite one. It was the first time I ever saw Gary Burris and he was fabulous. He created the show and he was the most entertaining person I have ever seen. He has a great sense of humor and is a wonderful singer. I loved the fact that he didn't tell the audience what to do or how to feel. He just let us be ourselves. The music was great, the sound was great and the stage was amazing. It was wonderful to see the city celebrate the arts. I was glad to see so many people come to enjoy the show. This is a very talented man and I hope he is able to get his own show in Las Vegas.

 This is a great movie, and an AMAZING tribute to the greatest American writer. I will always remember this movie, and will always love it. Even though I am only 4 years old, I can remember this movie, as I have seen it over and over again. This movie is a MUST HAVE if you have children, as I am very sure that it will be a very good movie for them. This movie is a true classic, and for that reason, I give it a ten.

 It's not the best Woody Allen film, but it's perfectly good and not bad at all. It's a little bit more serious than his standard films, but that's no bad thing. His portrayal of a relationship between two people is flawless, especially the part with the girl's father. The performance from Jack Black is also very good. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the ending. It was just too short, but then again it's not like it was a long film. The direction and cinematography were excellent, and I think the music was very good too. The way Allen constructed the film was also quite good, and the scenes were quite effective. Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good Woody Allen film.

 This is a fun and romantic film that is reminiscent of the old days of the movies. It has all the charm and nostalgia of the old movies and the feel that the viewer is taking a trip down memory lane. It is a simple story, but the story is interesting and the characters are great. The music is also wonderful. The viewer can feel the love between the characters and it is a very relaxing and enjoyable movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take a trip down nostalgia lane.

 I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 1985 and was mesmerized by it. I had read the book some years earlier and was fascinated by the idea of a film based on a book that is essentially a whodunit with an unhappy ending. I saw the film when it was first released in the US, at the New Beverly Cinema in Hollywood, and was pleased that the story was told with some fidelity to the book. I still think it is one of the most underrated films of the last decade. It possesses a reality and simplicity that makes it a fairly easy film to watch, even though the subject matter is of a nature that may not be to everyone's taste. Robin Williams is brilliant as the detective, a man with a need for answers that drives him to solve a murder that seems to have no end. The story is also interesting because it shifts from the viewpoint of the detective to that of the murderer, played with realness by Kevin Bacon. It's a shame that this film wasn't better known.

 The film is based on the true story of the murder of a young girl. After a night of heavy drinking, the main character (played by Pacino) starts to feel remorse and decides to confess his crime to the police. <br /><br />I would say that this film is very good, not because the story is great, but because the acting is superb and the direction is very good. Pacino does a great job and his acting is very natural and believable. Sharon Stone is also good in her role as well. The other actors are also very good and help in bringing the story to life.<br /><br />This film is very good and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama.

 This is the first of several South Korean movies about the Korean War, but it's the only one I've seen that doesn't have a love story at its center. Instead, it's about a family that loses its father in action, and the oldest daughter is at first too shy to speak up for her feelings about her father after he's dead. Her older brother, however, has no such inhibitions, and it's he who gets the family through the awful war years of the 1950s. The movie is not a "feel good" story, nor is it a tearjerker. It's a realistic--even chilling--look at a family going through the war, and the two brothers' relationship to each other is the central theme of the movie. Not only do they depend on each other, they need each other more than they know. They're a family that's been split apart by the war, but they also realize that they can't live without each other. The performances by the two brothers are very good, and the screenplay is well-written. I really enjoyed this movie, and I think it would be a good one for people who are interested in Korean culture, as well as people who aren't. Very highly
 I was disappointed like everyone else that the first 3 seasons of Iron Chef were not available on DVD, so I bought the set. I had to watch this set twice to pick up the nuances of the show. It's a complicated show. I think the last season is better than the first. I have to watch this show again to see what I missed. I'm glad that the show is still on air. I think the show is really about cooking, but the fights are secondary. It's a good show with a great concept. I was a fan of the show before it was on DVD.

I recommend this show to anyone who has an interest in watching a cooking show. I would also recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of Iron Chef, or a fan of cooking shows in general. It's a good show.

 The first two or three of the three stories are worth the ticket price on their own. The best of the bunch is "The Anomalies," about the power of the media and the political correctness of the day that make the story of Dr. Duane Dibbs and his "kids" a little hard to believe. A little. But then, that's the point and, fortunately, the conclusion is a little more credible than the rest of the film. The other two stories, "The Viceroy of Death" and "The Last Laugh," are much more like the movies that director Robert Tinnell and writers Robert Tinnell and Phil Brooker are famous for, and they are first-rate. "Viceroy of Death" is a good, old-school vampire tale, and "Last Laugh" is a very funny, absurdist take on the story of a man and his twin brother (played by the same actor) who get into a fist-fight and senselessly kill each other. The remaining story, "The Mummy's Curse," is a little more like the movie I expected, the kind of story that's been done to death in the past. But it's still well worth the price
 I saw this film tonight at the Library Theatre, in San Francisco. I had seen the trailer, and knew that it was a film about a woman who found herself in the middle of an ocean on a raft, while in the middle of a war. I had also heard that it was a very beautiful film, and I was not disappointed. I was also not disappointed by the performance of the lead actress, who I have never seen in a film before. I also was not disappointed by the music. The music was very relaxing, and the film was very relaxing. I really enjoyed this film. I recommend it to those who like music and peace. I also recommend this film to those who love to see a new face on the big screen.

My rating: 9/10

 I've seen the first two episodes of this show, and I have to say that I'm loving it. I'm a fan of the original film, and I was happy to hear that they would be retaining the main characters. I have to say, though, I'm a bit disappointed with the way they are handling the characters. They are doing an excellent job of making them relatable, but I'm a bit disapointed that they don't have the character development other shows seem to have. The first two episodes have been fun and funny, but I'm not sure if the show can keep up that pace. We'll see how it goes.

<br /><br />As for the plots, I'm a bit disappointed that the main plot is being developed at such a slow pace, but I'm not too worried. It seems like the show is going to explore the characters, not so much the crimes. The cases are exciting, but the characters are what will make this show great.

<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing more episodes!

 Maybe I'm part of the group that you are talking about. I didn't think 'I Am Legend' was all that good a movie. I mean, it was great for what it was. But compared to say, 'The Day After Tomorrow', it just didn't have the same effect on me. I think the main reason is that I've seen too many movies like this before. They can be great and memorable, but they tend to be rather predictable. I think it is because we've seen so many movies with the same theme and the same plot, that they really tend to become less and less interesting to us. Think of 'Das Boot', 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'Apocalypse Now', for example. I think it's better to stick with a good story, and leave the special effects to the special effects guys. That way you can truly savour the story and the acting. In this case, the story was great, and so was the acting.

I think that Ben Affleck did a great job as Will Smith's character in this movie. The best thing in this movie was Will Smith's acting. I don't think I would have liked him as a character as much if he had
 I just saw this movie last night, I'm sure everyone has been waiting on news that they can see the movie. I just wanted to say it is worth the wait. It is a superb movie with a good story and actors that did a great job. The movie is not in color, but I would still recommend it. The movie is about a boy who is a genius and a girl who is a normal girl. They both go to the same school, but they don't know it. The boy thinks the girl is smarter than him, but in reality they are both smart in different ways. The movie is about a murder that takes place at the school and a girl working at the school becomes involved. There is a small amount of blood in the movie, but the murder is not bloody. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

6 out of 10.

I hope everyone is able to see the movie.

 When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a little much. But after seeing the two sequels, I'm not sure if I would have liked this movie if I had first seen the sequels. I recommend the sequel to be first seen. However, the original is worth watching once. The acting is great, the story is good, and there is a really good twist at the end. I think that this movie is a must see for anyone who is a fan of horror, or just a fan of a good story.

3 out of 5 stars

(I give it 3 out of 5 because the acting is great, but it's not the best acting I have ever seen.)

And a tip: This movie is hard to find. I have seen it many times, but I have never seen it at my local video store. But, I've seen it at other stores, such as Walmart. So, if you do find it, try to get it from your local video store. It may be harder to find.

(Another tip: If you get it from Wal-Mart, I strongly recommend getting it from the video section. It's much cheaper to get it from the video section.)
 I came across this video when I was looking for a comedy video to watch and I was hooked. The movie is very funny and I don't know what to say other than that it is a great one. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell, Tom Hanks and Jamie Foxx and I'm glad I found this movie. I was laughing from start to finish. If you like Will Ferrell, Tom Hanks and Jamie Foxx then you must see this movie. I promise you that you won't be disappointed. <br /><br />I give this movie a 9/10.

Funny (er) movie.

Author: M. O'Barr (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) from Thornhill, Ontario, Canada

I like Will Ferrell and the cast in this movie. I also liked the premise of this movie. I thought that they were funny. However, I didn't think that they were funny enough to be nominated for any awards. I think that the story was stupid
 I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I have never been a fan of the genre of zombie films. I am not a fan of the genre of horror in general. But this movie was a good balance of great characters and great acting. I love the music score, and the acting was great. The plot is a bit vague, but it is not confusing. I can tell that it was made by a director that was not used to making movies. I believe it was a first time director that also acted in this film. The casting was also good. My favorite acting in this film was that of the young girl that played the lead role. She had a great range of emotions and she was very believable as a young girl in a dark situation. The only fault I found with the film was that it was a bit long. The movie could have been made a bit shorter, but I still enjoyed it.

 I really like this movie, and I believe it's a great film for kids of ages 8 to 13. I saw it on TV and was so impressed that I bought the DVD to watch over and over again. I watched it with my 4-year-old son and he enjoyed it, too. It is not a scary movie, which is good for children. It is a comedy, but it is also a very touching movie. The story reminds me of my childhood in the 50's, and I wish it could have been a reality. I think this movie should be shown in schools and libraries, because it teaches children important things about life, family, and the true meaning of Christmas. I wish I could get a copy of the book because I would love to read it. I think this movie would suit a wide audience, and children of all ages will like it.

This movie will be on TV again soon. I hope it runs every day, so that more children can see it. This movie is a must watch for all ages.

 I have watched this movie many time and will do so again. I love the characters and was so happy to see that the evil characters from the original have been updated to the next generation. I love the fact that the main characters are not the best looking guys and that the supporting characters are not the cutest either. I also love the fact that the supporting characters are more interesting than the main characters. I like the fact that the supporting characters are not the typical evil characters that you normally see in movies. They are not the ones that pretend to be nice in order to get you to trust them. In short, I love the movie and find it hard to believe that this is a remake of the original. I would like to see a sequel to this movie.

 I don't understand some of the negative reviews here. This is a very well made, good looking film. The acting is superb. Peter Fonda is terrific. Who knew he could act? The film is very good. It is a story that could only be told in a period movie.

Anna Paquin is a great actress, and her directing debut is a good one. It is not a great film. It is not a masterpiece. It is a very good film. It is a very good story. It is a very good movie. I saw this film a couple of days ago, and I am still thinking about it. I highly recommend it. This is a good film.

Here are some of the negative things I saw mentioned:

1. The ending is a little weak.

2. There is nothing special about this story.

3. The acting is sometimes wooden.

4. The music is nothing special, and sometimes overpowers the film.

5. The plot is not advanced.

6. The atmosphere is not very tense.

7. The cinematography is not very good.

8. The movie is not very fast paced.

 I think this is a 3.5. I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it. It was a good, solid movie, but there were some things I didn't like. First off, they said they were going to make it like a documentary, and they did, but it wasn't as good as a documentary. Second, I really hate the "we were all there" thing. Like, we were all there, and we know what's going on, and we know the story, and we know the ending... It's like saying "We were all there, and the thing happened when we were there." I know, it's not exactly like that, but it's close enough. Third, I don't think that what happened should have happened. I know it's a movie, but it's still fiction. Fourth, the parents should have been in it more. They were the only ones in the movie who were really seen doing anything positive. They were the ones who were really trying to help. The other stuff was just a bunch of people going along with it. Fifth, I think the ending could have been better... it was a little too sudden for me. Sixth, I think the movie needed a little
 Superb cast and excellent production combine with a top-notch script to create a classic. The time-space concept is very well done, with the actors getting caught in the past as the past is making its way back through time to the future. The story is compelling, the acting is superb and even the special effects are riveting.<br /><br />10 out of 10.

A very good film with a great cast.

Author: Mr. Andrew from British Columbia, Canada

The acting is very good. Bernadette is great. Stephen Rea is brilliant in the part of a mysterious doctor. Julius Harris is good in the part of a British professor. David Rintoul is great in the part of a police detective. Plus there is a great supporting cast. The story is excellent. The time-space travel is also very well done. The story is excellent and the acting is very good. The story is excellent, the acting is excellent, the special effects are good, the story is excellent and the acting is very good.

 The story is a bit stretched out at times, but the movie has a great cast. Besides the star, who plays the hero, you have Kurt Russell, as the bad guy, and Kevin Bacon who plays his partner. You also have Tia Carrere who plays the woman that was in the military with Kurt. Now, again, all this is stretched out a bit, but it does, as I said, have a good cast. The story, however, is about a guy who is a military veteran, who, in order to save his life, has to do some illegal activities. But, he is a good guy, and he is the hero. He is not going to kill another human being. But, he is not going to let the bad guys have everything. There is also a love story in it. It's a good story, with good acting. I recommend it.

P.S. Kurt looks great in this movie. He is still one of my favorite actors, and he only seems to get better.

 I have recently seen this movie twice in the theaters and it was one of the best of the year, I don't understand why it hasn't gotten more attention. It's a film about the love of two friends for the same woman and how their love for her changes them both. It's a touching film that is funny and sad. It's a film with a great soundtrack and some great actors in it. I loved the way the film ended, it was very touching.

 If you love horror movies and funny moments then you should rent this movie. The funniest part of the movie is when the killer gets out of the shower and hugs the girl who was in the shower with him. The movie is good, but I wish they had more scary parts. There were several times where I was afraid they were going to be killed. I wish they would have shown a little more gore. This was a good movie, but it doesn't compare to the original.

 This movie is a classic. It shows the human side of a man who has finally come to life with the help of a new girlfriend. I still watch it from time to time to remind myself that there is a world outside of my everyday life that is great.

There are several romantic movies where the main character has a life-long crush on some girl, and he finally gets his chance to be with her. When you watch this movie, you really get the feeling that the main character has had his chance and that he is finally getting the girl he has always wanted. It's a very enjoyable movie and I can't wait to see more words from the director.

 I like this movie. It is about a man who is given a year to live after he has a brain tumor. Everyone is against this. He is poor and lives in a trailer park. He finds out that the makers of the tumor are after him and will stop at nothing to get him. He has to learn to live with the fact that the tumor is gone. It is well done. I like the ending. It is not the typical happy ending. It is very realistic. I raise my rating because I like it.

I love this film. It is about a family of lawyers. They are all different. The mother is about to have a baby and she has a divorce. Her husband does not want the baby to be born. He does not want to deal with the child. The mother goes through all kinds of problems to keep the child. I like this film because it is about real people. It is about people that are real. It is about people that are not perfect. I am glad that it does not have a happy ending because that is not real
 This is a scary, but good movie about a bunch of kids who wake in a field, only to find that they are not in their hometown. The kids must go on a journey to find out what happened to them, and why. The movie is directed well, with lots of creepy twists and turns. This is a movie you will enjoy if you like scary movies.

A casual stroll in the woods turns into a nightmare when a group of kids wake up without any memories of who they are or how they got there. This movie is a real shocker, and is full of surprises, but is a bit too slow paced and predictable. However, there are some good scares, and it's well acted and a good concept.

 As a person who's been thinking about joining the Army and getting a commission, this movie is a must see. I went and watched it Friday night and I think it was the best movie I've seen in a long time. It's a very realistic movie. The director was able to show all the actions of a soldier on the front lines as well as showing a person who is in the war for only a short time. It's really a great movie. I think it will help any person who is thinking about joining the Army. It's a great role model for people who are thinking about joining the Army and I think it will help the recruiting of people who are interested in joining the Army. I think it's a movie that should be in every school, especially in schools that have a military unit. I think it should be a must see in every school. I think it should be shown in every school and it should be on TV. It should be shown in all of the schools in the country. This movie will show people in the military that there is no hatred and that you don't have to be a person with a bad attitude to be in the military. The movie shows that the people in the military want to help other
 The plot of this film is very weak and the characters aren't very interesting. However, the acting is fantastic and the ending is one of the most emotional I have seen in a long time. This film is worth seeing it for the acting but the plot is weak.

 I am a fan of the original "Citizen Kane". The film is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. That said, I have never been able to understand why the rest of the film is so widely hated. Yes, I agree that the film is slow at times, but it is so well constructed that it is worth watching the whole way through. The story seems to fade away after the first half hour or so, but just as Kane's life starts to come into focus, it fades away again. The problem is that the film is not meant to be watch as a stand alone, but is meant to be watched in the same way that one watches a book. The more you know about the story of the film, the better it will make sense. It takes a while to build up to the major character-change, but once it is there, it is well worth watching the rest of the film to see how the rest of the story unfolds. If you have not seen this film, then I strongly recommend it.

I recommend this film to those viewers who have seen the original "Citizen Kane" and still like the film, but who don't like the pace of the film. For
 This movie has a different plot than the novel, but it is quite entertaining.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the book, but I found the movie quite enjoyable.

I have read a lot about this town in the novel, and I can say that the movie does it justice.<br /><br />I do not have a lot of experience with this author, but I do have a book of short stories, and I am not sure if the short stories are based on the books of the same name. I do know that the story of the movie is different from the one in the book. It might be interesting to see the movie if you like the novel. I found this movie to be very entertaining, so if you like movies with different plots, you might enjoy this one also.

 The first time I saw this movie, I was astonished. I mean, I'm a big fan of the original "Halloween" (1978) and most of the sequels, but this one is something else! It's not just an excellent sequel, but it's a new chapter of the franchise! This movie is the culmination of the novels by: John Carpenter, Debra Hill, and Carpenter himself; and it's a solid piece of work that honors the original while also advancing the series. The music and the sound effects are perfect, and they bring the house down in a scene that is particularly amusing and scary. Jamie Lee Curtis' character is just as great as ever, and she is as funny as ever. I love her character, Laurie Strode, and I love her role here. I also love Gloria and all her scenes with her dancing with Michael, who is so very funny. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.

 This is a film that had the potential to be something truly special. I was looking forward to this film, as it was about a time and place that has always fascinated me. Unfortunately, for some reason, the film seems to have been rushed and is not quite what I expected.<br /><br />First off, I am a big fan of the British TV series "The Avengers" (1961-68), and it was a little disappointing that the film didn't have any of those characters in it.

The lack of action didn't bother me too much, but I was hoping that the film would have a bit more "oomph" than it did.<br /><br />The acting was generally quite good, with the cast being well suited to the period and the story.

 This movie starts out pretty strong, with a story about a woman who has a torrid affair with a married older man. Then, it gets kind of boring and a little stupid, with the main female character becoming an anti-hero and the older man becoming a victim of his own past. Then, it's about a young man who falls in love with a younger woman, and then, it becomes a little more interesting, with a lot of betrayal and a little violence thrown in. I thought it was pretty good, but it's nothing that special. It's kind of like a good version of "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" without the best parts. I'd recommend it, but with a lot of reservations.

 The first (and undoubtedly the best) of the three Priscilla Queen of the Desert films, this one is all about the music. It's the story of the three drag queens, who are trying to get their act together to save a theatre. It's also about two drag queens falling in love, and the rest of the cast is just great as well. I was particularly impressed with the acting from Catherine Deveny as the cabaret diva who falls in love with the drag queen, and from Hugo Weaving as the drag queen who wants to be the star of the show. It's not the best film, but it's certainly worth seeing.

 A wonderful FX-heavy film that wasn't a box office bomb (but earned 5 million less than the first one). <br /><br />To add to the fun of this film, the plot is just an excuse to have some fun with the FX. The scene with the giant footprint is an example of this. That scene is so over-the-top, it's almost funny, but it's still so gross that it's not funny. It's just funny.<br /><br />This film is also notable for not using computer graphics for most of the film. The special effects are done with practical effects, a first for a movie of this scale. The result is that a lot of the film looks like a movie from the '30s.<br /><br />8/10.

 The film, and the book, are both a little confusing at the beginning, the movie being at least 15 years before the book, and everyone seems to be talking about something else - but it's a story of a world much different from our own, and one in which the hero has to learn how to 'read' the book, how to use it to help him out of his predicament. It's a film that explores ideas of survival, and the idea of 'self'. The main character, while not extraordinary, is a good guy, and is a survivor, who, like the reader of the book, has to learn how to use the book to survive. The movie is a good metaphor for the book, and the book is a good metaphor for the world - the world of the movie, that is. All in all, a good adventure, with a great cast, and yes, I liked it.

 This film is a retelling of the story of the Greek goddess Hera and the Trojan War (although in the film it's presented as a modern day story about an advertising executive and a former beauty queen). This film is not exactly "deep" or "honest" in the way that most films of this genre are, but it's charming, funny and at times, moving. The performances are strong, the characters are likable and the situations are somewhat believable. It's a good movie to watch when you're in a good mood and your mind is not too cloudy. I also appreciated the fact that there was a little bit of romance in between the comedy and the drama, which is more common in comedy than in drama. I think that this is a good film to watch.

8/10

2.0 out of 5 stars Not great, but not terrible either Format: DVD "Hercules in the Haunted World" is basically a movie about a guy who builds a giant statue that is supposed to be the greatest work of art in the history of mankind. He has to find a goddess to put on top of the statue. She is a demoness and is shown to be a very scary and scary person.
 I found this movie to be very interesting. The fact that it's based on a true story is what makes it all the more interesting. The acting was very good and the dialogue was also very good. The story is also very well written. I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good drama.

This movie was great, because it was based on a true story. The acting was great
 The Green Berets is a good film. It's not a great film, but it's a solid, down-to-earth, action movie that gives you everything you want and expect from the genre. It's not a great movie because of its historical background or the military detail. It's a great movie because it's a fun, well-made, entertaining, entertaining movie. It's one of the few war movies that has been made that isn't just a bunch of baby-boomers cast in their own roles, but one of the few that actually has a plausible military background and one that doesn't stir up the emotions of the audience. The cast is high-caliber and the director does a good job of directing. The story is simple and straightforward, the action is plenty. All in all, this is a solid military action movie that shouldn't be missed.

 The story is a bit complicated, but I liked the story very much. The movie is so real and so serious, that I thought it is a documentary. I thought it is a foreign film, but it is not. There are quite a lot of similarities between the film and the real events. I thought it was very interesting and I really enjoyed. I was really moved, when the father of the girl, who was raped by the soldiers, is shot in the head by a sniper. It was a powerful scene. I was very happy when the story ends, because I need to know if the girl had a baby as she said. I think the real soldiers are great too. I think the story is realistic and the film is very well made. I thought it was really a good movie, because it really affected me.

It's a pretty good movie. I think it's a bit too long, but it's well made. I think it's an interesting story. I think it's something that happens in reality, and I think it's something that should be seen. It is a bit too much of a courtroom drama, because the court scenes
 Starring John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Willem Dafoe and Forest Whitaker, this film is a drama/thriller of a sort, and a good one at that. It is rated PG-13, but that rating is well deserved. The violence is fairly minimal, it's mostly just the general atmosphere that could be called dark, and the sound is sort of grainy and low-fi, which fits the film's mood. The story is relatively simple, but very effective, and there is enough back-story to give the film some depth. The acting of the leads is excellent, and the supporting cast is solid, although a few of them seem a little lost in their roles. The cinematography is good, and the music score is excellent. The camerawork is excellent, and the editing is very tight. The film's soundtrack is a complex blend of orchestral, electronic and ambient music that is very effective. The film's ending is a little abrupt and poorly executed, but overall it is a good film. Recommended.

 I have seen this movie several times. It is a very touching story that shows how love can be both confusing and rewarding, and how people can change in the light of love. Of course, the story is more complex than that and it is in my opinion a very powerful story. The acting is wonderful and the direction is exceptional. The movie is beautifully shot by a very talented crew. The music is also very good and adds to the atmosphere of the movie. This movie is a must see.

3.0 out of 5 stars Well-occurring characters and plot but poorly executed. Format: VHS Tape This film is very poorly executed. I think the script was poorly written and the acting is also poor. The film is a little bit slow and boring. The characters are well-occurring and the plot is interesting but poorly executed. I personally think that this film would be an interesting film to study in an English class in a high school. It has some interesting concepts and it shows the effect of love in people's lives. This film is a good example of how the working class struggles to find love and an example of how love can change people. I think this film
 This film was not even close to being a waste of time. The story is well thought out, the acting is great, the direction is superb and the cinematography is breathtaking. The ending made me cry as it was so sad and tragic. The story is of an individual who has a "death wish" (or maybe it is a wish to be alive). He is a Vietnam vet and one day decides to kill himself. However, he decides that he would like to have someone with him. He goes to a local bar and finds a woman who is looking for a ride to the city. He takes her to the countryside, where he kills her, then takes her out to the beach and buries her. He then takes a plane to the city and is never seen again. The ending was so sad and wrong that I cried like a baby. The whole film is filled with subtle messages at times and other times just straight up shots of death. If you haven't seen this film yet, you should.

THIS IS A MUST HAVE! I had never heard of this movie until a buddy of mine sent it to me. I watched it
 I don't know why this movie is so under-rated. It's a real roller-coaster of a movie. It has the best car chase in a movie ever, the best action scene in a movie ever (the "get away car" chase), and it has the best script in a movie ever. It's about a guy who's the best at everything, but he's really not a very nice person. But he does get his comeuppance when he kills a man and has to leave town. He also has to clear his name of being a murderer, which he doesn't want to do. It's so good, there's a sequel. Which is better than the original? I don't know. But it's worth watching. I'm surprised this movie has such a low rating.

 The only reason this movie probably isn't getting the acclaim it deserves is because of the way it was marketed. It was marketed as a comedy and rightfully so. However, this movie is so much more than just a comedy. The film is about death, love and relationships. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile. It is a perfect mix of comedy and drama. The acting is superb. I like the direction and camera work. The movie is about a father who dies. He leaves his daughter in the care of his girlfriend, a prostitute. The daughter falls in love with the prostitute's son. The prostitute and the son both fall in love with the same woman. In the end, the prostitute realizes she doesn't love her son and she must decide if she is going to stay with the son or the daughter. She chooses the daughter and has her son take care of the daughter. I give this movie an A. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good comedy and drama.

 This is an interesting film that uses the popular music of the 70s to tell a different, darker story. It starts out with a young man who is a musician who is bullied at school and is looking for a way out. He gets involved with the wrong people who put him in a situation where he has to get even. He ends up killing one of the people and is sent to a juvenile facility where he meets another criminal who tells him of his plan to get out of the facility and get even bigger. This is an interesting film as it uses the music to tell the story and it is well done. The acting was also good. This is a good film and if you like music and crime, you will enjoy this film.

 Cenie is a very interesting movie. It seems as if it is trying to be a comedy, but it works as a drama. It is interesting how the characters are written so that they can turn on you in an instant. The acting is great, but it seems that none of the characters are given much attention. The characters seem to be the focus of the movie and not the plot. The plot is very interesting and its good that they don't waste any time telling you what is going on. The way the movie is put together is very interesting and it will keep you guessing. It is a very interesting movie that will keep you guessing what will happen next. It is a very interesting movie that you will want to see more than once.

I have to admit that I feel the movie was a disappointment, partially because the movie is based on the book of the same name by Heather Harpham. I have never read the book, but am
 The first and last quarter of the film is a little bit boring, but the second is as good as the first. I think it's a good movies for a family film.

The movie is about a boy who wants to be a cowboy, but his father doesn't want him to be a cowboy. The boy goes to a gambling game, and wins, and becomes a real cowboy.

The boy, who is 13 years old, is played by Will Smith, who is perfect for the role, and I think the other actors, who played the outlaws, are good too.

I like this movie because it's a good family film. It's not a cowboy film, though, but that's okay.

I recommend this movie.

 This is the second time I've seen this movie. And the first time I didn't particularly like it. But after some thought, I decided to re-watch the movie and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The movie is about a kid, who travels to a small town in the mountains for a vacation. But in the mountains, he is confronted with a cult that doesn't take kindly to people who are different from them. And he must find out how to survive in the mountains and help a group that's been trapped by the cult.<br /><br />I'm not going to say too much about the plot, because there are so many twists and turns in the plot that it would ruin the movie for someone who hasn't seen it before. But I will say that this is a really good movie. And I recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies.

*Note* I did not receive this movie for free.

**EDIT** Okay, I just watched this movie again, after a long time. And I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. It may not be as good as Scream, but it's definitely better than I remember it to be. And
 <br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. I recently read the book and was a little disappointed that the book did not cover the whole story. I think the movie is perfect. The story itself is great - the plot is so intricate that it keeps you on your toes. The characters are believable and the acting is excellent.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is perfect as the young lawyer. He could play the role of the lawyer a million times over and I would still continue to enjoy it. I was also impressed with the way he was able to make the audience feel for the lawyer in the movie when he was trying to find his daughter. It was amazing.<br /><br />The other characters are well cast and have just the right amount of depth. The actors that play the fathers are also well cast and believeable. I especially enjoyed the way the father in the movie played his role. It was so realistic.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams was great in the movie. She is a very good actress and her role was believable. She had a lot to do in the movie and she pulled it off. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that it was a little long
 When you have a film that is so culturally significant and yet has the potential to be so tremendous and yet is so mediocre, it's a shame and a wonder that this film was stuck with such a mediocre label. In fact, I think it's a shame that it was labelled at all. The film is at least as good as the film that came before it, and it's definitely a step in the right direction. You see, the three previous films were all directed by the same man, and this film feels somewhat like an extension of the first two in terms of the tone, story and characters. It's the same man, but it's not the same movie. The story is about a small town in the south who has a racist sheriff and a KKK-esque group, and the town's people decide to take care of the problem themselves in the most direct way possible. The townspeople are more 'modern' than the other movies, and they are also more poignant. This is the first of the trilogy to have a real sense of humor, as opposed to the other two that have far too little. It's the first of the trilogy to have a real sense of the time period, and there are some truly great sequences
 This is a very interesting documentary about the lives of a group of people that really didn't think that much about their lives, until they met each other. The shots are really nice, and the music is really good. The acting is also good, and they do a good job at showing you what's going on in their lives. If you're into documentary films, this is one that is recommended to watch.

 This is an early version of "Don't Look Now," with a very similar plot. It is not a horror film, but is about a mother that goes out to look for her child and finds a horrific scene instead. It is shot in black and white and uses a lot of low light and dark areas. This film is really good, but dated. I actually saw this in the theaters when it came out, and I really enjoyed it. It is a very eerie and creepy film.

The acting is also very good, especially from Oscar-winner Kim Darby. She is very believable as the mother going through this horrible ordeal.

Overall, it is a very good film and is worth watching.

 The movie was not as good as the book. The movie had a lot of differences. For example, in the book there were four survivors, but in the movie there were only two. In the film there was not a lot of references to the book, such as "Wait till you hear this one", "that reminds me of the book" and "my favorite moment in the book". In the book, Tommy and the others were not scared to die and did not care about their lives, but in the movie there were a lot of scenes with people having a hard time and dying, and there was one scene where Tommy had a hard time and died. In the book, even though Tommy had a hard time and died, the others stayed with him and did not leave him. In the end of the book, Tommy and the others were not gonna die, but in the movie Tommy and the others did die. And there were a lot of differences in the movie.

The movie was good, but it was not as good as the book.

 I am a huge fan of Adam and Steve. I am a huge fan of the commentary in their videos. I am a huge fan of all things Adam and Steve, so when I heard that Adam and Steve were going to do an episode of Mystery Science Theater, I was thrilled. I was even more thrilled when I heard that there would be an Adam and Steve episode of Mystery Science Theater, and I was even more thrilled when I heard that Adam and Steve would be writing and producing. I was overjoyed when I heard the final product would be an episode of Mystery Science Theater, and I was overjoyed when I heard this episode was going to be a riff on Hell Comes to Frogtown. I was overjoyed when I heard that Adam and Steve would not only be writing and producing, but would be doing the riffing. I was overjoyed when I heard that Adam and Steve would be doing a riff on Hell Comes to Frogtown, an episode that they did in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode of the show. I was overjoyed when I heard that Adam and Steve were going to riff on their own episode of Mystery Science Theater. I was overjoyed when I heard that there would be a riffing
 I'm not a big fan of kids movies but I enjoyed this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it is a fun movie for a fun family movie night. The actors were good, the plot was creative enough, and it's not a remake of a previous movie. There is just enough suspense and humor to make this a family movie night worth it. The "voice over" was pretty funny too. I would recommend it for a family movie night, especially if you want to watch something a bit different.

 In the spirit of the old T.V. show 'The Dating Game',this movie follows the same pattern,but with a twist.The twist here is that the man (who is a professional chef) is asked out on a date by a cute little blond,who is actually a professional interrogator for the CIA and his date is taken to a secluded cabin in the woods,where she will quiz him about his intentions for the evening.They dine on a fine dinner,then the fun begins.What would you do if the woman you were on a date with had a gun in her hand?Hint,you don't want to find out the hard way.This is a good movie,and the dialogue is very good.The question is,how good is the food?I give the movie a 7 out of 10.

 This movie is one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time. The cast is really good, the writing is funny, the characters are memorable and relatable and the movie looks great.

 I have read many reviews, and have been through all the options of this movie online. As a person who is generally skeptical of movies, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was made with a lot of care, and is a great depiction of what goes on in the world of a young girl who is faced with an unplanned pregnancy. The acting is excellent all around, and the entire cast does a great job at portraying their characters. The mother's struggle is realistic, and makes you wonder if you could do it. I think this movie is another step in the right direction for television, and I think it should be broadcasted on HBO or some other cable channel. It would be a great addition to the other movies that are on HBO, and would be an excellent series. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is thinking of having a child, or is currently struggling with a child, as well as anyone who is considering adoption.

This movie is great. It really shows what it is like to be a mother who is going through a pregnancy and the choices that have to be made. I think it is so important to show what it is like to be a young girl
 The movie is beautifully shot and edited and the acting is great. The music is powerful and the story is powerful. The ending of the movie is breathtaking, who could have predicted that? When the movie ended, I was breathless and had tears in my eyes. I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie, but I will say that you must be prepared to be stunned.

 This is a very funny film. There are some good jokes, a few that made me laugh out loud, and a few that made me laugh as I was watching. The plot is not very original, but it is well done, and the characters are likeable and funny. I also think that, although the plot is not that exciting, it is well done and gives the characters more depth than just being funny. The film is not totally original. It is based on the movie "Grosse Pointe Blank" (which I think is a much better movie), but it is a very good adaptation, and the movie is still very funny. I also think the film is a good example of a film where the soundtrack is better than the film. The movie has a good soundtrack and music, but the film is just ok, but the soundtrack is good. The soundtrack is played by the band The Black Keys. The band has a couple of good tracks, but the film is just ok, so I think the soundtrack is better. The songs are very much like the songs in the original, with the same mood and feel. The soundtrack is better in this film than the original, but the film is still worth watching. The film has a
 This is a great movie. Well, maybe not great, but still a lot of fun to watch. I was a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters, so I was really excited to hear that they were making a new movie. The original movie was a lot of fun, and I was glad to see that they didn't make any changes to the original idea (I could see a lot of people getting really annoyed over this).<br /><br />This was an excellent cast. They were all great. The only one I wasn't that impressed with was Ernie Hudson (he was okay), but everyone else was great. I was especially glad to see Rick Moranis make an appearance since he's been pretty much forgotten by the public since he left the "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" movies. He was great in this movie, and was a lot of fun to watch. I was also happy to see Sigourney Weaver in a movie again. She's been pretty underappreciated lately. <br /><br />Overall, this was a great movie. I'm glad they made a sequel to the original movie, and I hope they make more movies after this and continue the series.

 This is a very good movie, but it is not a lost classic. The acting was good, and the storyline was engaging. However, the idea of the movie was so old that it was a little hard to believe that it was all that it was cracked up to be. It just shows that if you don't have a good script, it doesn't matter how good your acting is. I would have to give this movie a 7 out of 10.

4.0 out of 5 stars When you fall in love with a movie Format: DVD At first glance, this movie seems like an old-fashioned romantic comedy. But, when one digs deeper and watches it over and over, it becomes a very poignant and moving movie. The acting is superb, and the storyline is believable and heartfelt. The love aspect of the movie is very real and touching. All of the actors in the movie are excellent, especially all three of the leading men. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies with a good plot, great acting, and of course, excellent love scenes.

5.0 out of 5 stars A Best Bet Format: DVD When I first saw this movie, I was surprised by what a good plot and
 I have seen this film 10 times and it still is funny. The plot makes sense and you don't have to have a lot of knowledge of history to enjoy it. The set up is easy to follow and the characters are real. The actors are all good and the script is well written. The acting is so real that you will feel like you are there. I also think that it is one of the best films of the 80's. It is one of those rare films that you can sit down and just enjoy. It is not a comedy just to make you laugh but it makes you laugh because you can see what is happening. This is the kind of comedy that does not insult your intelligence. It is a comedy that you can laugh at for the laugh that you get out of it and not because you are making fun of it. This is a film that has really touched me and one that I will never forget. I recommend you see it.

I am giving this film 10 stars, I am giving it 11 stars with the "and two for good measure".

 Determined to become a famous actress, Meg (Karen Black) moves to Los Angeles to seek out an agent. While she's waiting for the phone to ring, she learns that her father, a famous and wealthy architect, has died. Meg also finds out that her father left her a large amount of money, which she is to inherit when she turns 25. That night, Meg is attacked on the street by a stranger who wants to get his hands on the money; but Meg manages to escape thanks to a passing policeman, who is pulled over by the very same man. When the officer refuses a bribe, the man chases him down the street and is shot and killed by the policeman. Meg's first thought is that the cop was a hero, and the man who tried to kill her was a murderer. Yet the police do little to investigate the death, and when Meg takes it upon herself to investigate, she learns that the man's mother was once an actress, and that her son grew up with an obsession for her. And, after being told by a local detective that the man's mother is still alive, Meg heads for Hollywood in order to meet her. Once there, she meets a man named Hal Singer (Robert For
 I just finished watching this movie for the first time. I was stunned. I had never seen anything like this film. It's such a dreamlike, surrealistic dream. It's like a dream you have when you are on drugs, or when you are sleeping. And yet it is so incredibly vivid, and incredibly real. I couldn't stop watching it, even though it made me feel slightly uncomfortable. It was like watching a movie that was so real, it was like a nightmare you couldn't wake up from. I'm going to watch it again and again. It's just amazing. I don't know what else to say.

P.S. From what I've read, the director is a little nutty. But he's an interesting nutty nut.

P.P.S. I think this is the most beautifully filmed movie I've ever seen. There are so many shots that are stunning and visually beautiful. I just could not take my eyes off the screen.

P.P.P.S. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that had so many different shots and effects, like a film school movie. It's so panoramic, and so expansive. It
 This movie is a parody of the classic film "The Godfather". It follows the story of a young man's rise to power in the Chicago Outfit, a real life Mafia organization. Michael is a young man who, after the death of his father, is forced by his mother to become a part of the family business. So, he decides to become a made man, a high ranking member of the Outfit. He succeeds in this, as well as his sexual conquests. He is also attracted to his cousin's wife, and eventually she is forced to sleep with him. Soon, he's a high ranking member in the Outfit, and has his own hit man. The movie ends as Michael is assassinated, and his cousin becomes the new boss. This movie has a good message in it, as well as some good acting. I recommend it to anyone, especially those who are interested in gangster movies.

*6/10

TRIVIA:

The movie was written by Paddy Chayefsky, who also wrote "Marty".

The movie was directed by Fred Zinnemann, who also directed "Marty" and "The Manchurian Candidate".


 This film is a good one. The actors are good, the plot is interesting, the cinematography is even good, and the soundtrack is good. I'm surprised this film is so overlooked because it is a good film. There are a few flaws in the film though. I would have liked to see more about the characters personalities, especially the ones that are in prison. I also think that the story could have been told in a slightly different way. Overall, this movie is a good watch for those who like drama, and prison films.

Dear Annie,

I have to say that I love this movie! Its so realistic and the acting is amazing. I think the best thing about this film is the fact that it has no special effects or anything like that. The director makes the film look like real life. I think all of the actors are really good. I think this movie is also really good because you can tell that every character is really a person, not just a character in a film. They all look like real people and you can really feel their emotions. You can really tell the director was trying to make a good movie, not just a movie. I
 I was only 10 years old when I saw this movie for the first time. I have seen it several times since then, but my favorite time was in 1995, when I watched it with my best friend. We were both in awe at the breadth of the movie. It seemed to me to be a movie with such an intricate plot, yet it was not too complicated to figure out. The fact that the movie is about a girl who falls into the world of an evil queen, who is trying to be reborn, made the movie even more intriguing. The way that the scenes are shot, with a camera that is always filming the action, makes it feel as if the viewer is always right there with them. I think that this is one of the best movies that I have seen, and I can't wait to see it again!

My rating: 10/10

 "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. In the movie, there's a lot about the Greek culture, and the constant jokes about it are great. I've been to Greece a few times, and I love how the movie is based on a true story. The movie is very typical, but I love it. The cast is fantastic, and the actors who play the extras are just as good. I've seen this movie about 10 times, and it is absolutely hilarious. The movie is about a Greek girl named Toula, and her family and friends. I think all of the characters are very realistic, and you can tell that they are all very authentic. I have a lot of friends who have been to Greece, and they loved this movie. I think it is a very good date movie, because it is really funny and you can relate to it. I think the best part of the movie is when Toula and her dad go to the Greek festival, and they really do all of the dances. I think that the movie is really funny and enjoyable, and I wish it was on DVD. My favorite part is when they have a dance sequence and they're all dancing
 Somewhere in America, a young girl is waiting to meet her father who is coming home from war. She is waiting in a car in the driveway. She is killed by a car driven by a young man who is fleeing the police. I'm not sure where the movie fits into the continuity of the series, but it's a very good movie and worth seeking out.

Blythe Danner and Peter Falk are both excellent as the mother and father of the dead girl. As the young man who kills her, the actor playing the part is very good. He's the perfect mix of a young man who still has a lot to learn about the world and the sort of person who knows he's doing the wrong thing and is doing it anyway. I'd like to see him in another movie.

An excellent movie. You'll love it!

The first time I saw this movie, I was really impressed. I had the exact same reaction when I watched it again. It's a very good movie. I'm not sure if I liked it more the second time, but I liked it just as much. You'll love it
 I've seen a lot of low-budget student films and this is one of the best I've seen in a while. The acting is pretty good, and the story is original, especially in its own way, and the production value is pretty good. The film is written and directed by a guy named Ryan Candara, who is from San Jose, CA (i think). The film was shot by a guy named Justin White, who is from Phoenix, AZ. The film was edited by a guy named Eric Whitacre, who is from Orange County, CA. The film was scored by a guy named Bobby Redding, who is from Seattle, WA. The film was produced by a guy named Tim Gainer, who is from San Jose, CA. The film was distributed by a guy named Ryan Candara, who is from San Jose, CA. I think they did an amazing job with this film, and i think you should check it out. I give it a 8.5/10

 I have seen this movie with my family on a DVD. It is very amusing, entertaining and heart warming, under ordinary circumstances I would have given it a 9, but I gave it a 7 because there was one part that really upset me. There was a woman who had six children and she was about to give birth and the doctors said that there was a 50/50 chance that this child would die, and if it did, she would have to have an abortion, but she decided to give birth to this child anyway, and they ended up dying. I was very upset by this, because I have six children, and I would not have an abortion, but I am not sure if this is an accurate representation of what really happens. I would like to see if this movie is accurate or not. I am going to buy the DVD and check it out for myself. Overall, I really liked this movie and I would recommend it for anyone who likes to watch movies.

 I read the book, and found it to be an excellent piece of literature. The movie version, however, did not live up to my expectations. There were some good points, but there were also some major flaws. I would recommend the movie version only to those who already have read it, and are looking for more depth of character and story.<br /><br />The basic story line is the same, with minor changes. Spencer Tristram is a young boy whose grandfather is dying, and has written a will, which Spencer's father is attempting to keep from being read by the public. Spencer is sent to live with his grandfather's brother, and his cousin, who is a lawyer. Spencer's Uncle and cousin have a black housekeeper, and Spencer begins to realize that his new life is not all that it is cracked up to be. His Uncle is a man who does not build houses, but lives in a large mansion. Spencer has to pass a test to prove that he has the ability to live in the mansion, and with each passing day Spencer begins to see that his Uncle is keeping secrets, and that there is more to the house than meets the eye.<br /><br />The novel is full of humor,
 I loved this movie. My mother and I saw it at the theatre and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story was very emotional, and the actors were perfect. The movie brought me to tears and I still can't stop thinking about it. I think the movie was very beautiful. The music was also very beautiful. The movie was about a young woman named Alice who lived in a small town in Pennsylvania. She loved one of her friends, who was married to a man named Carl. Alice loved Carl, but she knew that he was married to Mary. Mary was a very jealous woman who wanted Carl all to herself. After the birth of her child, Alice's two best friends, Sofia and Beatrice, tried to help her by giving her love poems. They tried to give her hope. But, when Alice realized that she loved Carl but he had married Mary, she left town and went to Philadelphia. She took her baby with her. She had become self-possessed. Then, Carl and Mary find her and, afterwards, Carl was killed in a car accident. Mary took her baby and went to live with her sister. Everything was ok, but Mary had a secret. She was not
 I did not like this film at first, but after repeated viewings I can no longer deny the greatness of this film. It is an amazing piece of work and it's a shame that it hasn't made it to DVD yet. I can't recommend this film enough and I think it is one of the top films of this decade.

<br /><br />It is a brilliant film and it tells the story of a middle-class family and the one person who breaks this family. The film is well made and has a great story. It is one of my favourite films of all time and I think that it is worth watching.

<br /><br />The DVD release is promised and I hope it comes soon because I think that this film is brilliant and it is one of the best films of all time.

<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD release and I hope it comes soon.

 I'm a huge fan of the original movie, and this was a nice follow-up, with a lot of fun new characters and a lot of fun new situations. It isn't quite as funny as the original, but it's close. There is a lot of action, too. It's a little more serious, but it's still a nice movie.

***The movie was rated PG-13 by the MPAA.***

I don't know what I was expecting, but I must admit that I was not expecting it to be this funny. "The Mummy Returns" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The laughs almost come out of nowhere. They are not forced, and they are not obvious, so you can laugh at practically anything. The characters are fantastic, and the story is just as good. The action scenes are just downright entertaining. "The Mummy Returns" is not a movie for children, but it is a lot of fun for anyone. It is for anyone who likes action movies.

 I saw this when it first came out, and I loved it. I haven't seen it since, so I can't say if it's still as good as I remember it being. I guess it's funny that I love it so much. I think it reminded me of the movie "Slap Shot" (the hockey movie, not the Judd Apatow movie.) I used to love the movie "Slap Shot" when I was a kid, and I still love it now. I love the way "A Mighty Wind" captures the feel of a hockey game, and the antics of the characters. I don't know if I could see this movie being funny for kids. It might be funny for adults, but I think it would be too raunchy for kids. I'm not sure if the kids in this movie would get the joke with the things that the kids in "Slap Shot" got the joke with. But in any case, "A Mighty Wind" is a great movie.

 This is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. It has all the ingredients of a great comedy: good script, good cast, a good director and a great ending. As I said it's a comedy, so no characters die, but the comedy is so good that you won't mind. I think it's about a girl who is really a boy and is really a girl, I think. It's a story about a guy who is really a girl and is really a guy. I'm not sure, but I think it's a story about a boy who is really a girl and is really a boy. I think. It's about a girl who is really a girl and is really a girl, I guess. I'm not sure, but I think it's a movie about a guy who is really a girl and is really a boy. I think. Well, what's it all about anyway? You decide. This is a hilarious movie with a great script, good casting and and a great director at the helm. Definitely worth watching.

 This film is one of the best films of all time, and will be remembered for many years to come. I am an elderly man and this film is one of the first films I saw when I was a child. I was so moved by the film that I am now the oldest member of the family room I am in now and the youngest member is a little girl of 9 years of age. My parents if they were alive would be amazed to know I am watching this film. If you have not seen this movie, you should get a chance to see it. I can't say enough about how moved I was watching this film not only as a child but as an adult. I am sure you will be too. This movie will touch you and make you cry.

 I love this movie. It's a wonderfully unique and strange film. I saw this movie at the local art house. It was just a black and white film, but the white is actually a very dark and dingy black. The plot is about a man who wants to go to space. Not a space shuttle, but to the orbit. He is a very strange man. He is a very intelligent man, but he is also an odd man. He is a very odd man. He is a very odd man. The other characters in this movie are equally weird. There is a man who is a very exotic doctor. There is a very mentally disturbed old woman. There are two very odd children, who are twins and they are very cute. There is a very strange and exotic woman who is a very exotic and exotic woman. There is a very strange and exotic woman who is a very odd man. There is a very odd and unusual man who is a very unusual man. There is a very weird man who is a very weird man.

 This is a fantastic, funny and gut-wrenching movie. It is not just about a man's battle with the 'dark side', but the battle that takes place in his own mind. A brilliant and sad movie.

This is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen, and is a great example of how even the most 'normal of people' can fall into the clutches of darkness.

A must see!

9/10

(spoiler alert!) At the end of the movie, the main character gets his final wish - to win the lottery. But, as we all know, wishes don't always come true.

For those of you who are squeamish about watching people die, the death scenes are short and are not graphic.

A very sad movie, but a good one all the same.

See this movie, you won't regret it!

 If you've seen the original film, you know what to expect. If you haven't, then you're in for a treat. I'm a fan of the original, and so I loved this film as well. The makers have kept the basic premise of the original, but have added some new twists here and there. The actors are really good. I'm not sure who to pick for the lead roles, but either way, they're both wonderful. I'm so glad that this movie was made, and I hope that more people will be able to see it. It's a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend it.

Since i am a big fan of the original, i was disapointed when i found out that this movie was not in the same vein as the original. I am glad that they decided to change it up and add a few new twists to the story, as it is a very good movie. I feel that the two leads do a great job, and i am looking forward to seeing them work on other projects in the future. I think that this movie is a great way to introduce people to the original, and it is a great way for the people who haven't
 Edith Massey's death certificate states her year of birth as 1908 and her place of birth as "Raglan, South Wales". It bugged me for years. Then, I stumbled across a published work about Wales and its people. It was written by Dafydd Elis-Thomas, a Welshman. It's called "The Welsh Way" and is published by Grub Street Press, Washington, D.C. 1997. I originally was fascinated by the photo of Massey that appeared on the jacket. But then I read about her in the book, and to everyone's credit, she seemed fit to be true, as the book would have it. I read the book and she appeared to be quite a character, and it's quite a story.<br /><br />Massey was born to parents who were of Welsh descent. She was born in 1908 and was married, I believe, to a man of Irish descent. She lived in Wales and later in London, England. She was a devout Catholic and a pacifist, who joined a group called the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She traveled all over the world, and she was a big fan of India and Buddhism. She also wrote
 To say that this film is not very good, would be unfair to its creators. The problem is that they have too much on their plates. The film is a mixture of documentary and fiction. The documentary part deals with the family and friends of a young woman who has just died. The fictional part deals with the relationship between the actress who plays the young woman and the director who is filming the documentary. The film is not very good in either part. The fictional part is not very good because it is not very good. The documentary part is not very good because it is not very good. The only reason that this film is not a complete disaster is because it is an interesting mixture of documentary and fiction. This is a difficult film to review because it is not a film that I would particularly want to watch again. I did not find the documentary part very interesting and I did not find the fictional part very interesting. The only part of the film that I would watch again is the fictional part because it is very, very good. I am not sure that this film is good enough to recommend to anyone.

 Based on a true story, this film is about an Australian motorbike racer, who takes on the world in his quest for perfection. His brother, a policeman, is involved in chasing him across the world, in a desperate attempt to bring him back to face the law. It's a good action-drama, with great photography and sound. The acting is first class. The story is quite predictable, yet still an enjoyable watch. It does start a little slow, but it picks up with a great sense of pace and excitement. Don't miss this one.

This DVD also contains a behind-the-scenes documentary.

This is one of the most amazing racing films I have seen. It is based on the true story of the great Australian motorbike racer Mick Doohan. A film with a great deal of suspense and tension, it is very well put together. The soundtrack is fantastic, with great songs from the band AC/DC. It also contains a great deal of great information about motorbikes and motor racing in general. Mick Doohan is an awesome actor, and the other actors are very good as well. Overall, this is a film
 Among the complex group of characters in "The Third Man," the three main ones are Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), a British writer of pulp novels who has just arrived in post-war Vienna, and Harry Lime (Orson Welles), a mysterious man who has been killed in a car accident and is now residing in the city's sewers. In fact, Martins' wife Anna (Dorothy McGuire) has just arrived in Vienna and is working as Lime's secretary. Lime is a criminal who has been sent to the city by his boss Harry Lime (Ralph Richardson), who has been informed by his associate Colonel Kurt (Harry Baur) that Lime is out to kill him. Lime is holed up in a room in a men's clothing storehouse, where he has a staff of thugs who keep watch over him.<br /><br />The title comes from the fact that Lime has been given the identity of "Mr. Smith" by the people he works for, and because of his disguise, he can remain in the city for years without anyone suspecting he is not a native. He has a secretary named Anna, who is also his lover, and he is also in love with a girl named
 This is one of the best westerns I've ever seen. It is a story about a small town sheriff who is a loner and the women who falls in love with him. The story is about a murderer who is trying to get his revenge on a young boy for accidentally killing his horse. I highly recommend this movie. The story is very good, the music is great, the acting is great, and the scenery is breathtaking. I have this movie on VHS and I have watched it many times and I still enjoy it. I hope to see more movies with this same quality. I would love to see a sequel to this movie. I think that twice the size of the movie would be great. I can't wait to see the DVD. If you are interested in seeing this movie, I recommend seeing it as soon as you can. I would also recommend that you watch the entire movie in one sitting. The movie is very suspenseful and there are several times when you will be very excited.

 This movie is a masterpiece. It is a very clever adaptation of Harper Lee's novel that takes place in 1958. It has a great cast and a very good script. The story is about a black maid that has a white boyfriend and wants to get married. She didn't want to marry the white guy because his family would not allow it and she would not be able to stay at the house. The white guy is a very honest guy and he is really in love with her. The movie is about a big tension between them. This movie is a good movie for all ages. I have seen this over and over and it never gets old. The acting is great and the music is great. This movie is about a girl about to be married who was in love with the white guy and he was in love with the black girl. They got married and lived happily ever after. This movie is about a girl that is about to be married and she is in love with the white guy and he is in love with the black girl. They get married and live happily ever after.

 Maybe it's a bit too obvious, but I have to say that I love "The Death of Mr. Lazarescu". It's a perfect example of a film that does not appeal to everybody. That's why I think it's a good one for the critics' circle. It's the perfect movie for the intellectuals, and for those who don't like the intellectual approach. If you have a good sense of humor, then this one is for you. It's a good movie for the ones who aren't very critical but still don't want to be "intellectuals" (like myself). In a way, this is a deconstruction of the whole movie industry as well. This movie is a great 'anti-thesis' of the whole movie industry. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu is the perfect anti-thesis of Hollywood movies. It's a movie that nobody would ever expect to make. And it's a great one. I think the best thing about this movie is that the director found a subject that is far from the typical Hollywood movie. And he made it in Romania. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu is a movie about a simple Romanian guy. It's not about the politics, the
 This is a great movie, and I have never seen another movie like it! It is suspenseful, funny, and well made. It is very rare that a movie deals with the issue of mental illness in a way that is not only intelligent and deep, but also funny. It is the best movie about mental illness that I have ever seen. I want to see it again and again, like so many other people. If you can, get the VHS version of the movie as it has extras on it (such as a director's commentary, which is awesome). The movie is also a great way to talk about mental illness with your kids, as it is obvious that the main character (Sam) is a person with a serious mental illness. It is not a movie that is meant to be taken seriously, and it is not meant to be offensive.

 I was a big fan of the TV show, but was never able to catch the re-runs of the movie because it was always on at 4 a.m. My son, who is a huge fan, finally got to see it, and he was equally impressed. I've always wondered why the movie had never been released on DVD, so I'm really glad that it is now. It's a little different than the TV show, but that's what makes it fun! I'm glad to see a movie that has been released on DVD finally. I hope that the studio continues to release more of the movies from the series on DVD.<br /><br />I hope that we'll see more of the movie released on DVD in the future. I'm ready for more Thomas adventures!

A Thomas Pick-Up...

When I saw the movie "Thomas and the Great Discovery" for the first time, I was hooked. The animation was beautiful, the characters were funny and the songs were catchy. I was also very excited
 One of the most underrated films of all time. This is one of the few films I've seen where I was actually rooting for the bad guys. Unlike the current mainstream action films, where the bad guys are usually just seen as mindless cannon fodder, this film actually made you think that maybe the bad guys are right. The ending is, of course, a little predictable but the film has a certain quality that makes you want to see the next film. The acting is also very good and the overall story is quite intriguing. The only real problem I had with this film is that it was very hard to keep up with at times. The film was very fast paced and you were left trying to keep up with the characters. And the director really pushes the action scenes to the limits. I would definitely recommend this film to any action movie fan.

 I just got to see the first part of the film, and I must say that it is quite good. The acting is very convincing, and the story is very well done, moving from scene to scene with a creepy and understandable rhythm. I must say that I am quite impressed. The film will be shown in several theaters in the US in the month of February, and I hope that it will get the attention it deserves.<br /><br />The film is based on the true story of the kidnapping of a Romanian family in the United States. It is also centered on a young woman named Anca, who was working as a maid in a mansion in North Carolina, when she discovered that the family was being held hostage with a mix of threats and love. In the end, they took her and her boyfriend, as well. The film is full of suspense, and the acting is very good. The film is directed by Florin Iaru, and the screenplay is written by Florin Iaru and Radu Muntean. The film stars Paulina Porizkova, who plays Anca. She is a very good actress and a very beautiful woman. Also starring in the film are Stefania Ionescu, Alexandru
 I found it hard to watch the first half of the movie, only because my mom was in the audience with me. I thought that the movie was going to be a lot more graphic than it was. The movie kept on going and the more I thought about it the more I started to like it. I could relate to the movie more as the movie progressed. It was cool to see how the movie developed from the beginning to the end. I think that this movie is a good idea for anyone to watch, for the simple fact that you can relate to it. The movie is about a boy that has a lot of troubles and he is trying to do anything to make his life better. The movie shows the actor's struggle through their life. I think that this movie has a good message and the actor's have done a great job in their roles.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the actor's. I would also recommend it to anyone who is thinking about suicide and would like to know that there are people out there that care and want to help.

I give this movie a thumbs up

 I was really surprised by this movie. I am a fan of the genre and of the lead actors and I was quite disappointed by the movie. Don't get me wrong, it is not terrible and there are some funny moments, but the movie felt like they shot it in one day without any care. The movie itself is in the public domain so there is not much to say about it. It is like a bad B movie. What really bothered me was the fact that I waited a year to watch the movie when there are several good movies on the DVD. The main problem is that it doesn't feel like a horror movie. I know that it is a horror comedy but there is not much comedy. The movie was very predictable and lacks originality. I would have rather watched a comedy with the same characters from the original movie. I would rate this movie a 4/10.

 This film is a piece of art. A beautiful story of the life of a man and a woman. The music was great, the acting was great, and the story was just wonderful to watch. I have watched it twice already, and I am so glad it is out on DVD. It was a pleasure to see it. I would recommend this film to all.

 This movie is great! It's slower than most movies these days, but it's very good. I was very happy when I saw this movie, and when I saw it again I was still happy. My favorite character is The Wolf, because he is very funny, and very different. My favorite scenes are when he's eating the fish, and when he's chasing the rabbit, and when he's telling his mother. I recommend this movie to all ages, but especially to people who like comedy, and horror movies.

10/10

*** This review may contain spoilers ****

This is one of my favorite movies, and I watch it everyday. There is one scene in the movie, when the wolf is chasing the rabbit. He has a stick, and the rabbit is running away from him. The wolf is chasing it and screaming, "I'm going to eat you!" The rabbit is running, and the wolf is chasing him, and the rabbit is running away from him. And the wolf is screaming, and the rabbit is running. This scene is really funny, and really scary. I recommend this movie to people who like horror movies, and people who like comedy. This is one of my favorite movies, and
 I must admit that I was a bit skeptical when I first saw this movie. I am not a fan of horror movies. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was a very good, scary movie. The acting was very good and the story was original. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be scared.

For Halloween this year I decided to watch one of my favorite horror movies ever, Saw.
 I've read many comments on this film and found them to be in a great majority of cases very negative. It's a pity people don't see this film for what it is. It isn't a film about the late 80s or early 90s, it's a film about the future. It's a film about a stylized world of the future, a world designed by the films makers to be almost entirely artificial, a world that only has the minutest of connections with the real world.<br /><br />The film is about a world where people wear masks for every occasion. We see people walking along, some wear masks and others wear normal clothes, some wear masks and some wear normal clothes, some wear masks and some wear normal clothes. In small ways, the world that is being depicted is one that is almost entirely artificial. It's a world where people have lost their connection with reality, and the world they are in seems to be completely artificial. There are no rules in this world, no laws, no sense, no order, no structure, no meaning, no values. There is no connection between this world and the real world, between what we see and what we know is the reality of the world.
 There is a lot of fun to be had with this movie. It is the story of a teenager who leaves home with some friends to go to the summer festival in a small city. The only problem is that the bus breaks down and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere. While the teenagers are waiting for the bus, they come across a bunch of cool looking people who live in a secret community called The Family. They are so cool looking, that the teenagers can't quite believe that these people actually live there. To make a long story short, the teenagers soon find out that there is more to this mysterious community than meets the eye. This is a very good movie. It is not a perfect movie, but it is very good nonetheless. If you like movies which have a fun, adventurous, and suspenseful tone, then this is a movie which you should try to check out.

7/10

I give "The Family Man" a 7/10.

 This is a great film of the hard times that the people of Scotland were suffering during the mid 1800s. The first part is the story of Robert, a poor emigrant who, by marrying a girl who has a substantial dowry, makes a fortune and returns to Scotland with his new bride. This part of the film is quite long, but it makes clear the class and gender differences in the time. The second part of the film is of a free-thinking woman who is condemned to death for allegedly killing her lover. In this part, the nature of the time is made clear, as it is seen that she is not guilty of the crime. The truth is revealed, and she is set free. The movie is well made, and the actors are excellent. This is the best movie on this theme that I have ever seen.

I've seen the movie a couple of times, and I've always liked it. I was going to give it a second star, only because I didn't understand how Robert could be as rich as he was at the beginning of the movie, but that's not really the point. The whole movie is about how the rich got richer, and
 I just finished watching this movie, and I am so glad I did! I have never read the book but I am definitely going to. This movie was absolutely beautiful, and I was so drawn in. It was definitely a movie that left you with a feeling of sadness when it was over. This movie is about a young girl, named Julia (played by the wonderful Domhnall Gleeson) who lives on a farm in the 1920's. This farm is the beginning of a love story, between Julia and a man named Joe (played by the equally wonderful, and equally beautiful, score the rest of the movie by, Will Poulter). Julia is a 16 year old farm girl, who isn't really interested in all of the things that most girls her age are interested in. She isn't interested in the dances, and she isn't interested in the social life. She is very much interested in what she calls her "pink-alligator" (which is a leather bag), and that is the only thing she cares about. She isn't interested in what her mother has said she should be interested in, and she really isn't interested in anything else, except her "pink-alligator". When she's not
 The story is a little basic, but the music and cinematography makes it a very interesting film. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen a lot of films, the story is very basic.

 While I am not in any way a film buff I do like to see a good film and I did not think that this film was that bad. I thought that the acting was very good and that the plot was very well thought out. "Life is beautiful" is a film that will surely find a place in your heart as you watch it. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a good film and wants to see something different. I would rate this film a 8/10.

 A tale of a young witch named Rin-ne that moves in with her aunt, who is herself a witch. She and her friends meet a young boy named Kazuma who is in search of a quest that is connected to the magical world and their relationship is the heart of the story. In the end, they are forced to save their world from a magical calamity that has been brewing over the centuries.<br /><br />This is a very good anime and I highly recommend it. It is not just a love story, but rather a story about three friends that come to terms with their magical powers and their life choices. It is a very good story in general and the animation is very well done. The characters are very well done and the ending is a good one. I am glad I watched it because it was a very good story and one that I would recommend to any anime fan. It is very well done and the story is very good. I also like the characters and their personalities because they are very well made. All in all, it was a very good anime.

Title: Witch Hunter
 I rented this movie from a video store after hearing a lot of people saying how good it is. I agreed with those people and it was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The film is about the misadventures of Francis (Eli Wallach), an ex-con who has decided to re-enter society. He believes that by doing so, he will find the one true love of his life. With the help of his old friends Jerry (Bert Remsen) and Micky (Richard Boone), he is able to locate the one woman he believes he has met once before. She was a friend of his wife, who died still a virgin. Upon his first encounter with the woman, he is knocked out by a mysterious figure. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a small house with a beautiful young woman. He soon realizes that he is in the midst of a situation that will require him to survive... and the rest of the film is about his attempts to do just that. The film contains some excellent moments, but it is the actors that really make this film. Eli Wallach, as always, gives one of his best performances. I remember seeing him in a similar role in "
 In this highly dramatic episode of "The Twilight Zone", a husband and wife are on a camping trip with their two young children. The parents insist on sleeping in the same bed and the children are obliged to share their mother's bed. One morning, the youngsters awaken to the sound of moaning and they discover the father attempting to murder their mother. Their parents are found guilty of the crime and executed by electrocution. The children, who were never told of the murders, continue to live together.<br /><br />In this episode of "The Twilight Zone", the "monsters" are actually the children and their parents are victims. It is a sad tale of a dysfunctional family who, as in many families, have trouble communicating and find it difficult to compromise. The children's jealousy and their father's need for control are revealed by the actions of their parents, who are easily manipulated by their children to create the situation in which they are caught. This is a very poignant episode that is well directed and well acted. Rod Steiger is particularly good as the father and Grace Kelly is sensitive and subtle as the mother. Although the plot is rather predictable, it is engaging.

 This is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few months. It is not for everybody, the movie is very mystical & you need to be a little open minded to see it. The movie is about the life of a young girl named Sarah, who was born with a caul, a piece of the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby in the mother's womb. Sarah's mother dies in a car accident and Sarah is raised by her aunt Marjorie. When she is 15 years old, Sarah's father takes her to visit her aunt, who has become a very strange woman. She is obsessed with the idea of the caul, and the film is about Sarah's attempts to free herself from the hurt she feels when her aunt tries to make her believe that her father is responsible for Marjorie's death. Sarah is a very unusual character, and if you are not prepared for the twists in the story, you may not enjoy the movie as much. I do not want to ruin anything for the people who haven't seen it yet, so I will stop here. If you want to know more about the film, go to IMDb.com and read the comments, it is interesting.

5.0
 It's almost impossible to find a movie nowadays where you can't find flaws and where you can't find something to criticize. In the case of this movie, it's even more complicated. First of all I liked the fact that it was the first horror movie that I've seen that was shot in dark places, even though I've only seen it on TV. And I liked that the movie had a lot of consequences, so you really wanted to know what was going to happen, and that's not very common. I also liked the fact that it had a few funny moments, but they were also scary moments, because they were more intense. And I liked the fact that it was a pretty simple story, but they managed to make it interesting. And then there's the fact that it's a great movie, maybe the best horror movie I've seen, and I really love horror movies. All in all, I really liked the movie and I think it's a must see. It's not the kind of movie that I would watch every day, just because it's a little too serious for me, but I'll watch it again, sooner or later.

10/10

P.S. I also liked the fact
 The Tempest is a wonderful example of a Shakespearean play. The one criticism I would have would be that it is a bit slow in places. I would have also liked to have seen more of Caliban and more of Prospero and Miranda. The other criticism I have is that it is a bit too violent. I would have loved to have seen more of Caliban's interaction with Prospero and Miranda.

But overall, I would have to say that this is a must see for anyone who is a fan of Shakespeare's work.

8/10

(I must also say that I have not seen any of the recent versions of this play and I don't know if that was the reason I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.)

I wonder if there is a version of The Tempest that is more faithful to the original, that is more faithful to Shakespeare's play.

I have found this poster for "Midsummer Night's Dream" by the same director and it is the same price. I think that would be a better choice.

 This is the most amazing and beautiful film I've ever seen. I was amazed at how realistic the animation was and the fact that it was not overdone. The music was perfect and I loved the characters. This is a great film for kids who are just getting started in animation and it is a great film for adults as well. I can't believe that I haven't seen this movie, it is the perfect family film. I will definitely be buying it on DVD and watching it over and over again.

5.0 out of 5 stars The world's greatest animated feature film that is also the most realistic and beautiful. Format: DVD I'm not a huge fan of animated films, but I have to say that this is the best animated film I've seen. It is a beautiful, realistic story about a boy, who becomes the most famous explorer in the world, and his quest to find the truth about his father. The story is told in this film in one of the most beautiful ways I've ever seen in an animated feature film. Not to mention the brilliant music, which really gives the film a feel of a live-action film. The characters are also very realistic and the actors are stunning. The story is very different
 This is a really well-made film. It's slow-paced, and the characters aren't too likable, but they're also not unlikable. The performances are strong and the cinematography is excellent. In the end, it's a film about relationships, and the human condition, and it's done well. If you're looking for a slick, flashy movie with lots of action, this isn't it. If you're looking for a thoughtful, believable story about relationships and the human condition, well, this is it.

 The best film of its kind. It is a beautiful film. It tells the story of a man whose life is shaped by the people he meets. It's not a story about a man who is completely lost or completely found. It's a story of a man who is guided by life. It's not a film about love or sex or romance or happiness. It's a film about how a man relates to the people he meets. If the movie didn't end the way it did, I would have said the movie was about everything and nothing. It's not about a small thing or a big thing. It's about how a man takes everything in life to heart, and in the end, it's all a man can take in life. It's a beautiful film. It's a movie about life. It's a film about love. It's a film that contains love. It's a film about life.

 I was a fan of this show when it aired on Nickelodeon. I was happy when I found out that it was available on DVD. I was even happier when I saw the extras. This show is hilarious and I love the song "I Hate Being an Adult". It makes me laugh every time I listen to it. The cast is amazing! They're all so talented. The jokes in this show were very clever and I love the animation. I recommend this show to anyone. It's a lot of fun. It's like the stupid version of "The Simpsons" (which is a must-see).

 I really enjoy the films of the brothers Coen.<br /><br />They are very funny and they have a great visual sense. This is one of my favorite films of theirs.<br /><br />The story is about a man who's lawyer wakes up in the hospital with a new face. The lawyer is told he must either get a job and change his name or get killed. He then goes on a quest to find out who he is.<br /><br />The movie is very funny and a lot of the humor comes from the way the characters are played by the Coen brothers in their naturalistic fashion.<br /><br />This is a very good film and is a must see for fans of the Coen brothers.

Coen brothers at their finest

Author: John E. Williamson from Ford, Texas

12 September 2006



I haven't seen all the Coen brothers films, but I've seen a few of them and I think this is their finest effort. They really put together a good story and they managed to come up with a lot of very amusing
 The first thing that comes to mind when I see this film is how wonderful it is to see a first feature film from someone so young, it's a breath of fresh air. The story of a seven year old girl in a small town growing up, who is diagnosed with cancer is a hard one to watch and in some way sad. It's a story that I have seen a lot before, but with a little tact and imagination this film could have been different. It was enjoyable and it showed a lot of potential. I would like to see something else from this director.

A Movie for All Ages.

A great movie for all ages. It's a story about a little girl who is adopted, who through no fault of her own is taken from her family. She has to adjust to the new surroundings and make a new life for herself. It is a story about a child who is a little different from others, who's unique and struggles to fit in. The film is well acted and the story is great and original. It's a feel good movie that you can enjoy with your family
 'The Insider' is a very good film, with a very good cast and a very good script. It's also a film that is as much about the story of the tobacco industry as it is about the story of Jeffrey Wigand, the whistleblower who changed the course of the world's biggest tobacco company. <br /><br />This is probably a film that will divide viewers a lot. Some will love it, and some will hate it. It's a film that is very true to life, in the sense that the odds are stacked against the whistleblower. There are very few films that deal with this subject matter in this way, and the story is very well-told. <br /><br />The film follows Wigand's life, as he tries to work his way up the ladder at Brown & Williamson. It follows his attempts to get away from the company that he feels guilty for having worked for, and the efforts he makes to take some of the power back. <br /><br />The film is a very good film, with a really good supporting cast. It is well-made and well-acted, with a great script that does justice to both the story of the whistleblower, and the story
 I love this movie, it is one of those movies that you watch and say, "Oh my god, that looks so good what is it?" When you see it you are blown away. The movie is about an artist who is a genius, he is a dreamer and a realist, he lives in the real world, but he also has a fantasy world as well. His fantasy world is made up of people, places and things that are in his real world. The movie is so imaginative and creative, you can't help but be amazed by the real world and the fantasy world. The movie is funny and sad at the same time, the acting is great, the music is great, the story is wonderful and the visuals are stunning. I really love this movie and I highly recommend it.

 I have read the other comments and I think the ones that are saying that this isn't a masterpiece are just plain wrong. The movie isn't a masterpiece in the sense that it's a perfect movie and you can't wait to watch it again and again. It's a masterpiece in the sense that it is a great, funny and interesting movie that has a bit of everything. The movie is very funny, but it also has nice and touching moments as well. I like everything about the movie. The music, the main characters and especially the story. I also like that the movie doesn't have a very fast pace, but doesn't drag on. I think this movie is a must watch for all. I hope that the movie will get more attention and that it will be released on DVD. That would be the best.

Best movie of the year so far!

Author: Bryce from United States

10 May 2001



If you haven't seen it yet, see it! Not only is it an excellent movie with an excellent plot, but
 I'm not sure who's idea it was to try and make this movie, but whoever it was, I think they've done an amazing job. I was a little confused at first, but after watching it about 5 times, I'm now convinced that this is the Greatest movie ever created. If you've never seen it, please, please, please watch it. You will not be disappointed.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The movie tells the story of a boy named Charlie, who is very good at playing video games, but his dad doesn't think that video games are that important. One day, Charlie and his best friend, Albert, go to the arcade, and play a video game, and they get trapped in it, and they have to fight their way out.

The video game that was trapped them was Shadow of the Colossus, and it's not a very good game, but it's a very special game. They meet this girl, named Mono, and a bunch of other people. And the journey is hard, and a lot of other people die, but they eventually find the man who made the game, and he's killed by the bad guys, but
 The film was fun to watch and funny. The actors were very good, especially the two kids. The story was a little odd, but it was funny and interesting.

<br /><br />I didn't really care for the last 15 minutes of the film, it seemed too much like a "Sesame Street" type of thing. I would have liked for the story to go a little longer, to come up with some kind of explanation for the whole "alien" thing. But, I still enjoyed the film.

<br /><br />I did think the film was a little over-rated, but I wasn't disappointed.

<br /><br />Overall, I would give the film a 7 out of 10.

<br /><br />I'd probably rent it again if I had time.

<br /><br />I'd recommend it to a friend.

<br /><br />The film was entertaining.

<br /><br />There were a few times I laughed out loud, and other times I was cracking up.

<br /><br />I'd definitely watch it again.

<br /><
 A great classic that has been overlooked for a long time. My dad used to watch this show as a kid and I remember him telling me about some of the episodes. He loved it so much that he would bring it up every now and then to remind me how much he loved it. I watched it a while ago and I have to say it's one of the best that I've seen. The plot is great and the characters are very likable.<br /><br />My dad would always say "I don't care what your mom says this is a great show". That's how much he loved it.

 The first thought that comes to mind when watching this movie is that it is hard to believe that this is one of the first Elmer Bernstein scores for a movie.<br /><br />This is a completely wonderful score for a movie that I cannot imagine anyone not loving. The movie is made up of two segments:<br /><br />1. A man called Wagner (Paul Scofield) is a composer that is frustrated with his life. He drinks, smokes and plays the piano. His wife (Doris Day ) is a frustrated housewife who wants him to be more creative.<br /><br />2. The first segment is a flashback to the years before the war. Wagner is a young man that is in love with a woman (Shirley MacLaine) that is married to a famous composer (Robert Ryan).<br /><br />This movie has something for almost everyone. The dialogue is excellent and the acting is top-notch. The story is interesting and the music is superb. I think the best part of the movie is the music. Bernstein is one of the best composers of his generation and this score really shows it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes great movies
 I found this movie to be entertaining and entertaining. It has a lot of humor in it and the plot is good. I think it is a good movie for kids to watch. It is not suppose to be something that only adults can watch.<br /><br />I think that most people who watch this movie will like it! I give it a 10 out of 10 on the scale of 1-10. It is a good movie!

This movie was great for the whole family to see! I would recommend this movie for kids 8-12. It was very funny and very entertaining. I found it funny that the girl's name was Wendy and that the boy's name was Elton. I think kids will like this movie because it is funny.

I liked the movie, I
 A very witty and very funny film which is the only one I've seen which has the effect of making me laugh out loud without the need to be in a room of people. I just wanted to watch it again and again because it is so funny. A very crisp and clean picture also, not a single grain of dirt. I was laughing as much as I was thinking. I'm going to see it again when it is aired on TV.

 This is a very good movie. I have seen a lot of low-grade horror flicks and this one is one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone.

The acting was great and the the plot was excellent.

The only bad thing about this movie is that it gets scary in the middle of the movie.

Overall, I give it a 4 out of 5.

See it.

Mystery Science Theater 3000: Carnival of Souls

The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms
 One of the best and most unique romantic comedies that ever existed, this movie is a must for every romcom lover. From the very first scene of the movie, it was easy to see that the story was going to turn out to be a simple and heartwarming one. The script was hilarious and the cast was so perfect that it was hard to tell where exactly the movie was going to take us. The characters were played by some great actors and the humor was fun and funny. The chemistry between the actors was great and they radiated so much love, which came through the screen. The movie was also very well done, and the cinematography was amazingly done. The movie kept you hooked on the screen, and you couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. This movie was so good, that it didn't matter which character you liked, because you would end up loving them all. All in all, I would recommend this movie to everybody, because it is a great movie on any level. The movie is very entertaining, very funny, and very heartwarming, and I would say it is the best romantic comedy ever made, in my opinion. This is definitely a must-watch for anybody who truly wants to get
 This was one of the best movie I have seen in long time. It is so beautiful that I had to see it several times. Many people will say that it is a romance but I think it is more, a love story. I loved the way all the actors were playing the part. The music was great and the special effects were good. I hope to see more movies like this in future.

 I am a big fan of this show, and I have the suspicion that if it wasn't for the success of the movie it wouldn't be considered a favorite. The movie is a good adaptation of the show, but it's still not quite as good as the show. In the show, the characters are much more developed. Yes, the movie has a much better ending than the show does, but the show is much better in it's own right. The movie is still worth watching. It's one of the few times I've seen a movie based on a TV show that's better than the show. The show is also a lot funnier than the movie, but it's still great. I give this movie a 4/10.

I agree with JB, the movie is a great adaptation, but the show is better. I give the show a 9.5/10.

--K.C.

I think it's a great movie, but the show is even better. I give it a 9.5/10.

The show is great, but the movie is really good. I give it a 9.
 This is a great little movie that I grew up watching. I bought my VHS-R copy on eBay and can't believe how good it looks. I've watched it several times, just like I did in my youth. The best part is that it has a recently-discovered intact opening scene that never made it to the big screen. We do get a glimpse of Brad Hamilton, and that is a bonus. The T-Rex scene is a little grainy, but the rest of the film looks better than I remember it. Great little western that looks better than it was. This was the only movie directed by Jack Arnold, and it shows.

Danny Glover is terrific as the sheriff, and of course, there is the T-Rex. There is a scene where the T-Rex beats up a bunch of outlaws, and Glover's character (Sheriff) looks on in horror and can't do a thing about it. That is just great.<br /><br />I love the scene where the T-Rex is just walking in the street, picking up a dead body, and then dropping it in the street. It is a great scene.

I've watched this movie several times, and it
 This is a beautiful movie that is not particularly well known. It is the story of a neglected family trying to survive in an orthodox community. The father is a rabbi and the mother is a housewife. Both are Jewish but neither is particularly devout. The father is an intellectual and the mother is a housewife. The mother's husband had been a rabbi but was killed in a car accident. The mother's father had been a rabbi but died. The father has no children but has a niece and nephew who have been brought up to be his own. The story of the family is told through the eyes of a young boy. The boy is a very intelligent boy and when he is about to go off to school he discovers that he is gay. His father is furious and sends him to live with relatives in Scotland. He returns to the family when he is about to graduate from school. The father's anger at his son's homosexuality is the focus of the film. The father is a very angry man who is very religious and it is the religion that is his downfall. The mother is a very religious woman too but she is not as angry as the father. She is more compassionate and loving. The father's anger and the mother's compassion are
 I saw this movie at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, CA. It was a perfect night for this movie. There were only a few people in the audience, maybe 20. I'm a huge fan of all of the movies of the genre of "comic book" hero and I loved this movie. It was a perfect blend of the comic book, action, and romance. It was a lot of fun. My favorite scene was when the hero and heroine were in the car and the hero was saying how he would never let the villain win. He said, "I'm not going to let anybody beat me!" and he gave the biggest grin I've ever seen! It was great! I think I'm going to buy this movie on DVD and watch it over and over again!

6/10. Here's hoping it gets a sequel!

Superman Returns (2006) Not as good as remembered. 26 October 2006 - 1 out of 4 users found this review helpful. I have to agree with many other reviewers of this movie. I remember the original Superman and how great it was. I remember loving it and wanting to watch it over and over again. I'm
 This is a wonderful film. I am a huge drama fan with a passion for classic cinema. This film is a perfect example of what makes it such a great movie. The acting is superb, the story is suspenseful, and the music (both the original score and the new music by John Williams) is exciting, uplifting, and moving. There is a reason why this film has been put into the "top 10" categories of all time. It is a beautiful film and well worth the time to watch.

This film works on so many levels. The story is about a young boy who was kidnapped when he was a baby and raised by pirates. As an adult, he sets out to become a great explorer and find his true identity. The story has a wonderful cast of characters and the theme of family is woven throughout the movie. There is much to love about this film.

The movie is directed by Sergio Leone, who is a genius at directing complex and exciting scenes. This film is filled with action, suspense, and great music. It is also one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. The scenery is amazing. The camera work is incredible. The camera will go in and out of the water, back
 I liked the movie, although I would have never thought that one day I'd watch a movie about the writing of Gone With the Wind. It was very good and the acting was great, especially the young Sean Connery, who I am sure will become an actor. I liked the movie, it kept my interest and I got to know the actors, especially Sean Connery, who is a very good actor. I would have liked to see more of the Civil War and less of the time that Scarlett and Rhett enjoyed themselves or their love for each other. I was interested in seeing how the movie was made, and wondered if it was difficult for the actors. I would like to see this movie again and maybe I will, it is a good movie to watch.<br /><br />

This is a very beautiful movie and it is very well acted. The movie is about Rhett and Scarlett and how they fall in love. I enjoyed the movie and I
 This is NOT a "Western" (more like a tale of the Old West) but it is a very good movie. The movie is about a young man who is looking for a job. He ends up working for a local farmer who has a young wife. The farmer is a widower with a son but he doesn't know that his wife is having an affair with the man who is now working for him. The young man learns that his wife is having an affair and he decides to take revenge on the younger man by killing his wife. They end up killing each other but the young man gets away with the money that he stole from the farmer. He decides to leave the area but while he is gone he sees the farmer's beautiful young wife. The young man shows up at the farm and decides to take her back to his home. The farmer finds out and he goes after the young man and his wife. When they get to the young man's home they rape and kill the woman but they leave the man alive. The man decides to take revenge on the young man who he believes is the one who killed his wife. The man hires a local prostitute to kill the man who he believes is the killer. The prostitute does kill the
 I saw this film on HBO a few years ago, and laughed my ass off at the film's premise. The film is a mixture of a campy crime film and a soaper flick. The plot is very much like "The Godfather" but with a distinctly different feel. I liked the film a lot, and would recommend it to anyone that likes a good laugh.

I thought the casting was great. Billy Crystal was perfect in a role I wouldn't have imagined him for. The scene where he and another actor play a "couple", the scene where he is with his wife, and of course the scene where he is with his daughter; were all scenes that were very funny.

One of the funniest scenes was when the mob boss, played by John Goodman, was walking around with his two henchmen and he said "I love this town. I love the people. They're great." It was a scene that was really funny.

The film was rather well done, I thought. The film was very enjoyable.

 In this movie the world is destroyed, and the only way to save it is by going to outer space. Clint Eastwood plays a character who is the best man for the job. The movie is full of action and comedy, and Clint is the star. The movie is a great movie, and I think that everyone should see it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

 This is a classic, uplifting, inspiring, feel-good movie. I saw it when I was about 14, and it really hit home for me.<br /><br />The message of the movie is simple, yet powerful. It is about a girl from a small town in the Ukraine, who dreams of a better life for herself, and for her family. The message of the movie is that dreams can come true, if you work hard enough, and that if you are loyal to your friends and family, they will be loyal to you. The message of the movie is that if you believe in yourself, you can go places that you never thought possible. The message of the movie is that perseverance is the hardest part of being a person.<br /><br />I've seen the movie more than a dozen times, and I still find it as inspiring as I did the first time I saw it. I hope that one day, I can be as strong and as smart as the main character of this movie.

 A Ghost Story is a very unique and fresh take on the horror film. The film, like many of its genre, is pretty slow-moving, but the payoff is more than worth it, as the film offers a refreshing look at the genre, a story in which the horror element is more akin to an existential crisis than an actual threat.<br /><br />The film follows a man named Gates (Casey Affleck) as he experiences an unwelcome visitation from the ghost of his recently deceased wife. The film is really about the grief Gates experiences after his wife's death, and the emotional toll that comes with the process. The film deals with the nature of grief and memory, as well as how we choose to remember the people we've lost. The film explores how we wish to remember the people we love, and whether certain things are better left in the past.<br /><br />The film itself is a moody and dark drama, and it's refreshing to see a film that deals with these topics on a so-called "horror" film. It's a film that's sure to resonate with many audiences, and I believe it's one that many will find very engaging and interesting. The film is definitely worth checking
 I am not easy to please when it comes to crime dramas and I will admit that I had some reservations about this one. I know he is a bit of a wanker but I thought that it was worth a watch. The film has everything - action, romance and a great cast. The story is not the best but it is well-made and has some great fight sequences. It is not a bad movie. I didn't like the way the whole thing ended though and thought that it should have been given a better finish. I still think that it is worth a watch and I am not one of those who hates Jason Statham. I probably wouldn't recommend this to a friend but if you liked the other films and you want to watch something different then this is worth a go.

4.0 out of 5 stars A great under the radar film from Jason Statham! VINE VOICE Format: DVD | Verified Purchase The man, the myth, the legend. Jason Statham is one of my favourite actors and I have loved his career since I saw him as the villain in "The Rock" in 1996.

 I've seen this movie about a dozen times and I still get a kick out of it. It is a big, big, big movie, like a Fellini movie, but it's not as good. In fact, I think Fellini was the original inspiration for it, but it's certainly not a carbon copy of his. I think it's even better than "8 1/2". I enjoyed this movie immensely. I think the best line in the movie is "...." (exclamation point) ".... wanna see a movie?"

 This is an exceptionally well-acted and written film. It is the story of a white boy and the black servant he befriends. As it turns out, the two boys are later forced to flee from the South, where they had fled to save the life of the boy's mother, and go North to the big city to save the life of the mother of the servant. The boy finds himself in a strange, cold new world of poverty and racial bigotry; the servant finds himself in a strange, cold new world of business, of being an employee and not a citizen, of being forced to take an oath to remain in the U.S. just to get a job. The story is told through the boy, who is played by a young Anthony Hopkins, and the servant, who is played by a young Robert De Niro. Both actors do an outstanding job of portraying the different personalities of the boys. Hopkins demonstrates a boyish innocence and naïveté, while De Niro demonstrates a boyish bravado and a sort of street-fighter mentality. The story is told through their eyes, and there is a real sense of reality to the film. Richard Donner's directing is superb. He showed a great deal of talent
 This film is about an unusual family, whose members have been adopted from different parts of the world, who are now all living together. The story is told from the viewpoint of a young boy, who is the only child of the family, and is a very sensitive and introverted young man. He is extremely intelligent and his parents are constantly encouraging him to make friends and to get involved in activities around the house.<br /><br />As the film unfolds, it becomes clear that the family has a dark secret, which is never revealed to the viewer. This is an extremely intelligent film, which is incredibly well acted. However, it is much too slow and tedious to keep a viewer's attention for very long. There are some beautiful scenes, including an incredible montage showing the family members coming together in a very loving and committed way. However, the film is not very well edited and some of the scenes are disjointed, while others are just too long. It is a very sad film, which is quite hard to watch at times.<br /><br />It is a very good film, but it is not for everyone. The film was made in the early 90s, when the Romanian government was cracking down on the Roman
 The film is based on the true story of a woman who was raped by a man and ended up being sent to an all-girls' school. This film is about a group of girls at a school for girls who have gathered together to try and help each other, and by that I mean they are trying to help the girl who was raped. This story is not one of rape and murder, but of friendship and, in the end, love. The acting is great in this movie, especially from the main actress, who plays the raped girl, who is very sympathetic and very realistic in her acting. The film does have some scary parts, but overall it is a very good film.

 This film is a masterpiece. It tells the story of a woman who is raped and then painted as a whore. The movie shows the cruelty of men and how they rape women. And then it shows her transformation into a woman who demands justice. The film is not only a story of rape and victimization, but also a story of justice, revenge and female empowerment. This film will make you laugh, make you cry and make you think. It is a must see.

 The story of the band "The Bumblebees" is quite well told. The actors are quite good and the music is wonderful. It is told very nicely. The film is about the singer who is the lead singer of the band. He is married with a very high class woman but she is not too happy with her husband because he is a singer. She doesn't like it at all. One day she introduces a new singer. He is quite good, but he doesn't know what to do with his voice. He has a very good voice, but he can't control it. This film is a documentary about the singer. He is played by a good actor and his wife is played by another good actress. They are very good in their roles. The music is wonderful and the story is quite interesting. The music is played by the real band and the music is also quite good. It is also easy to understand why the band has such a bad name. The band members are all very good actors. They all played their parts very well. This is a nice film, but if you don't like the music then this is not the film for you. I loved the music and the story is quite interesting. It is not a
 This is a very fine movie. The story is a bit of a surprise, as it rather takes a different direction than the other "Hitchcock" films. The movie does not have the theatrical feel, nor does it have the frenetic pace of the other films. In this one, there is a sense of leisure and relaxation, and it is more in line with the other films in the series. Also, it is a little darker than the other films. It is a little more unsettling, but it is still very entertaining. The acting is great. In particular, we have good performances by David Hemmings, Isobel Elsom, and Dame Judith Anderson. Dame Judith Anderson is a very good actress; she is often in films that go unnoticed. She is a very good actress, and she is very good in this movie. It is good to see her in a comedy role. She has an excellent comedic side. The supporting cast is also very good. There are some good performances by the young actors. In particular, we have a good performance by Paul Freeman as young Charlie. He has a very good performance. The rest of the cast is also good. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is that
 A film about life and love in the South and about the harsh realities of the time. It is like a story about the past, but it is so realistic. The three main characters have to face a difficult situation and each one of them is forced to decide whether to stay or to go. The film is written and directed by the great Luis Buñuel. The music by Michel Legrand is so good. I really enjoyed it.

 An interesting film, with a few interesting characters. The ending might be a little bit of a cliff-hanger, but it's still really well done.

The film is about four different individuals, each with their own problems. The problem is that they are all in the same place, and each of them has to deal with the same problems. They all meet at the same place, and they all have to deal with the problems they have. In a way, it's not that bad. But there are some things that are a little bit weird. I wish they had done something more with the fourth character, who was no more important in the film than the other three.

The film is kind of a dark comedy, though it's not really a comedy. It's not really a drama, either. It's more like a drama/comedy.

There is a certain amount of sexual content in the film, but it's not really explicit.

The acting is good.

The cinematography is good, too.

The soundtrack is good. It's very similar to the soundtrack for the film, "Pushing Tin".

The director is good.

 After a long, long time the "Bibi Blocksberg" DVD finally appeared. It took a lot of my free time to get it, but it was worth it. It is a wonderful DVD with all the episodes of the first season, which is the first time they are ever shown again. And the episodes are not only restored but also enhanced. The original sound is restored, and the voices are just as good as they used to be. The episodes are split into a few different parts, and there is a "special" part that is taken from the German TV series. The German TV series is not nearly as good as the original, but it is good enough to have appeared as a DVD extra. The DVD also has some extras: two original TV series trailers and a text-only episode guide. I'm not a big fan of the German TV series, but it is still a very good DVD from a series that I really like.

 Starring in this movie was the most refreshing and likable actress that I have ever seen. All throughout the movie, Robin Givens is absolutely adorable and charming. Her acting skills were on point, and she is one of the few actresses that can make a simple role, like this one, look like a real movie. For those of you that haven't seen this movie, it is based on a true story. The only difference is that she did not kill her husband, but she did kill her father. She was fueled by vengeance and revenge. The movie starts out with her father being framed for the murder of her mother. He was in his own home, minding his own business when there was a knock at the door. He went to answer it and the next thing he knew was that he was lying on the floor and the police were there. He didn't have a chance to explain anything because he died on the spot. The trial never took place because it was too quick. She was told that she had to find the real killer. She refused to believe that her father was the real killer, so she went to her father's attorney and told him that she had to know if it was him. He agreed to take
 The opening scene is one of the most beautiful, but technically irritating, scenes I've seen in a movie. It is, of course, the birth of Jane Eyre (Mia Wasikowska). The scene is set in a small cottage between some trees. Then, the camera pans from the cottage, through a window and over to a bedroom where we see a perfectly symmetrical crib with a baby in it. Then we see the baby's feet protruding from the bottom of the crib and then a close up of her face. The camera then tilts down and we see the baby's left foot. The baby's left foot then starts to move and we see two feet, which makes me think of the old silent film The Unholy Three. That's when I realized the camera was on a dolly. This dolly movement continues through the rest of the first scene until we see the baby's head. The camera then follows the baby's head as it is held and turned by the mother. The baby begins crying and the camera quickly pans to the mother's face. She looks away and the camera moves to the baby's face and the whole scene repeats. This scene is so beautiful, but it is also so technically difficult
 I watched this movie because I thought it would be funny. I was wrong. I guess they didn't have enough money or something to get a good director and get a good script. It was very amateurish. You really don't have to understand the plot to love it. I am not a movie buff by any means, but I was still able to follow and enjoy this movie. If you are a movie buff, don't waste your money on this. It is about a group of friends who get together for a birthday party. Things go wrong and the friends must find a way to solve the problem. The friends are played by the main actors on the show "That 70's Show", Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Mila Kunis, and Wilmer Valderrama. Kutcher was my favorite because he was the main character and he just seems like an all around good guy. I really didn't like the movie, but I have to admit that I laughed a few times. The movie is actually pretty funny, but it is not without it's flaws. I would give this movie a 3 out of 10.

 I really can't rate this movie, I only watched it a week ago and I'm still trying to understand the plot and what happened. I have to admit that the movie didn't have the best plot, but it did have some interesting elements.

I first saw this film when I was a child. I was drawn to it because the director had made his debut with the film "The Sixth Sense" the same year. The plot was very interesting, and I have recommended it to several people since. The characters are very well developed, and the plot is very interesting.

 I got this movie from a friend who taped it for me. I thought that it was about a girl who was trying to get a job by bein a hooker. When I watched it, I was shocked to find out that it was about a hooker who was trying to get a job as a hooker after being out of work for awhile. That's how I got the title of this review. <br /><br />I liked this movie because it was very interesting. It was kind of two different stories mixed in one.<br /><br />I thought that the movie was well done. I also thought that the actors did a great job. The actors were good and I think that it a great movie to watch. I would rate this movie a 8.

I liked the movie because I can relate to it. I also liked it because I myself is a hooker and I don't mind being one.

 This movie is a must-see for all aging hippies who still believe in the good and bad of their generation. The good is that we are a colorful and colorful bunch. The bad is that we are soooo dramatic. The only reason I can think of to see this movie is if you want to reminisce about a time before the world went to hell in a hand basket and you need a laugh or if you are just crazy and like to be reminded of the good old days or if you have a baseball-cap fetish and want to see your favorite player as he was back in the day. If you're not a baseball fan, then you have no business watching this. The acting is OK but the movie is just too slow. It's about a guy who has to face his past and trust his instincts during a time of great social change and upheaval. While the early part of the movie is very interesting, you will find yourself getting bored by all the talking and rehearsing that goes on, especially when they are going over the same old stuff over and over again. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you either want to see yourself or your friends as they were in the 60's, or if you want to see your favorite
 After viewing this, I was struck by how much I enjoyed it. I have to admit that I was a little surprised by its age and the lack of special effects and music. The acting is good, the story is interesting and the characters are believable. The only drawback is that the plot has been done before, but that doesn't matter. The true test of a movie is how well it moved me. This moved me. I have to give it an 8 out of 10.

This is a really well written, well acted, good movie. I had to watch it twice because I got so drawn into the story line. And, when I say well written, I mean it. The plot is not just a rehash of other movies, it is unique and interesting. The characters are believable and interesting. That is something you can't always say about a movie. And, the actors are very good. Maximilian Schell is a standout. I was especially impressed with the performance of the young actor who plays the role of the boy's friend. He was terrific. However, the only thing I would like to see improved is the music. I felt that it
 It's not easy to do a movie that's really funny. Some movies have a few jokes that make you laugh, but most of them don't. But this one does. Bill Murray is so funny that you really don't know what's going to happen next. He plays the character of the husband with such a sense of humor that it's almost impossible not to love him after watching the movie. All the actors are great too. You just don't know what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I liked this movie so much that I rented it from the local Blockbuster and it's still on the shelf. I like to rent movies that I want to keep watching. It's not hard to come up with a bunch of movies that are great, but it's hard to find a movie that's great from the first minute to the last minute. Try this one. You'll love it.<br /><br />9/10

a great comedy

Author: ycovitino from United States

The best comedy in recent years.Bill Murray
 I know a lot of people are very against the movie, but I think it's a very good movie. It's not a movie that has a lot of action scenes or a lot of special effects, but it's a movie with some good dialogue, a good story and a good ending. It's a movie that has a very good cast, a very good director and a very good screenplay. The dialogue is so good that the characters talk just like real people talk. The director did a good job directing the movie. And the screenplay is well written. I think it's a good movie.

I think that if you see the movie, you'll like it. I would recommend it to people who like movies like "The Godfather", "The Deer Hunter" and "The Fugitive" movies.

I rate it 8 out of 10 for a good movie.

I hope this review was useful for you.

 People are so quick to judge movies for what they are and not what they are meant to be. I would have never seen this film if it wasn't for a friend's recommendation. I am a huge fan of silent film, and this is a great example of it. It's a silent western in the style of the great William S. Hart, which is what the movie is based on. Even if you aren't a fan of silent film, you should still give this a watch. It's a very entertaining movie and the story is simple and fun. It follows a prospector named Egan, who is a tough guy who is hired by a group of prospectors to get a gold vein ran through a mountain. The "little people" are the ones who are going to do the work. They are very small and don't know how to do any of the work, but they get the job done. When the movie starts, Egan is stuck in the middle of the two groups of people. It's a very entertaining movie and a lot of the jokes and gags are very funny. This is a great silent western that everyone should see. It has everything that silent film fans love. It's a lot of fun and
 ...and the ending is so damn good that leaves you wanting more. This is one of those movies that is so good, you keep thinking about it long after it is over and wondering how they could have ended it any better.<br /><br />That's a compliment. The ending is so good that I don't want them to make a sequel. I think it's too good to be topped.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that kind of makes you think, "What would I do if..." If a war broke out and they had to take up arms to protect their country.<br /><br />The acting is great. The lead character is portrayed wonderfully by Julianne Moore. She is able to convey so many different emotions and moods. The supporting characters were also well done, although I have to admit that I was disappointed by the fact that we didn't get to see more of the supporting characters. I would have loved to have seen more of the family that Julianne Moore's character married into. I also would have liked to see more of the other military personnel.<br /><br />I think the movie was an excellent tribute to the true meaning of the word "hero" and to
 One of the first foreign films I saw and I was hooked. I saw it many times over the years and it never gets old. The plot is simple but the characters are great. I have never seen a more realistic depiction of the French film industry than this one.

Also, I think the end credits are some of the best in the business.

I know most of the plot details but I love to watch it whenever I get the chance. The plot is so simple and has a very simple solution. You really don't need to know the details of the plot to see it is a great film.

The only thing I dislike about it is the fact that it is in French. I can understand the dialogue but the subtitles are very hard to read.

Watch it to get a glimpse at a world that is no longer around.

4/4 stars

There is also a TV series which is very good and also in french. The characters are also very likeable.

 The movie was very well done and the acting was excellent. They drew you in and you cared about the characters in the story. The movie was very well done, not just a series of events. There were several parts of the movie that I felt were very realistic and I could relate to. The relationship between the parents and the kids was very realistic, not just a roller coaster ride of emotions. I found myself laughing and crying at the same time. The movie did a great job of bringing a positive attitude to the whole story and getting the audience to say 'Amen'.

The only thing that was a little off was one of the characters should have been treated for her emotional problems, instead of just trying to cope. The movie was very emotional and it will make you laugh and cry. Everyone will be able to relate to this movie, whether you're a parent or not. You will walk out of the movie theater and say, "Wow, what a great movie."

I'd recommend this movie to everyone.

 I saw this movie at a movie theater here in Seattle, and it was a great way to spend a rainy day. I had never heard of this movie before, but I'm glad I discovered it. It's a story of a guy who lives in the city and is obsessed with the idea of going back to his childhood home in the country, where he spent much of his youth. One night, he slips out of the city, and ends up in the country. The next day, he learns that his father has died, and he goes back to the city and tries to figure out how to tell his father's wife. The film examines the relationship between father and son, and is a great look at the effects that our childhood has on us and how we cope.

This movie is a great example of a truly independent film. The movie was made for only $200,000, and the director and all of the actors are first-timers. Their hope or mission was to make the movie and have it be seen, and they succeeded. The movie is unique and very touching, and the acting by the cast is first rate.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great independent movie, or
 A classic example of the genre, this film is also a reference for the horror genre as a whole, a genre that had only recently been born out of the popular film noir of the 1940's.<br /><br />A "Cabin in the Woods" for the 90's, the film is a blast from start to finish. It is the kind of film that makes you laugh, cry, and gasp for breath at the same time.<br /><br />An example of the effectiveness of this film would be the scene in the diner, where the women are discussing the old newspaper clippings. The scene has the women discussing a murder, and as they're discussing, they are being murdered. The scene is suspenseful and horrifying, and is also very funny. The beginning and ending of the film also demonstrate this perfectly. The scene in the cabin where the old couple are discussing their marriage. The scene is funny and heartwarming, and at the same time, horrifying.<br /><br />From beginning to end, the film is an experience you won't want to miss. The acting is superb, and the characters are wonderfully developed. There are many memorable lines in this film: "You can tell a lot about
 Well, I'm not too sure. You see, at first I didn't start to get hooked into the movie until about halfway through it. It's not that it's a bad movie, in fact I think it's really good, it's just that it's a bit slow moving. The story is OK, but not anything new. It's a little more intense than the usual action/horror film, and it's a little bit different. I'm not sure if it's for everyone, but I think fans of the genre will really enjoy it. Fans of the original Friday the 13th, however, might not enjoy it as much.

I think the reason why I wasn't hooked into the movie at first, was because I was expecting it to be a bit more like the original Friday the 13th, which was a pretty good movie, but it wasn't as scary as the sequels. It's a shame because I think the original Friday the 13th is probably the best Friday the 13th movie. As for this movie, it's not quite as good as the original, but it's still pretty good.

Overall, I think fans of the genre will enjoy it, but they might want to check
 This is the story of a young, naive and delusional woman (Gillian Anderson) who falls in love with a man that she believes is nothing less than the Messiah. Of course, he is not the Messiah and he has a dark past and the ability to manipulate her into doing things she never would have done on her own. And, of course, she can't see that or she would have never let herself be manipulated into letting him do things to her. She finds herself at a crossroad in her life as she struggles to get out of the situation she's in and find out who this man is and if he truly is the Messiah. She has to trust in God to help her through this situation and to find the real truth. And, at the same time, if she is to find out the truth, she has to deal with the fact that she's been lied to by this man. And, she has to find out if he is the Messiah and if he is, what can she do about it. She has to decide if she can trust her feelings and her instincts, or if she can just go along with the program that he has set up for her. This is a very interesting story and it really gets you thinking
 Not exactly a story about parenthood, but about friendship and love between a father and his son.The movie is about the relationship between a father and his son. A young man named Thomas is a young man who is learning to grow up. He is confused about his sexuality and is trying to work out if he is straight or gay. His father is a successful but somewhat overbearing man who is an aspiring musician and Thomas has a father who is better at telling him what to do than telling him what he wants. Thomas has a girlfriend named Samantha who is exactly the kind of person that Thomas's father wishes he had in his life. Thomas's father is not totally understanding of his son's feelings and is constantly pushing him to behave more "manly." He is also more comfortable in the company of other men than women. Thomas has seven best friends, one of which is gay. Thomas has a close relationship with all of his best friends, even if he doesn't realize it. Thomas is trying to learn all of the things that his father has told him. He is trying to learn how to be a man and is learning the hard way that he is not really sure of himself. Thomas's father is not a perfect person, he is

 I saw it in the TCL 6 theater in Pasadena and it was great! The show was funny, well acted and written. The young girl playing the role of Frankie was very cute. I liked the way they did it. At one point, Willie Nelson appeared and he was hilarious. I also liked the fact that they have the show on stage in a theater and not in a studio like most of the other reality shows. It is a little expensive to see this in a theater but it is worth the price. It is not really a reality show, it is a stage play. I would definitely see it again. I think it would be a good show for younger audiences and kids. I would not want to see this show in a regular theater but it was great at the theater.

 "The Aviator" is one of the best films of the year. The performances are wonderful, and the movie is a charming and enjoyable piece of work. It also has a heartfelt message and positive values in it, which is one of the reasons I like it so much. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, and I hope it continues to be successful in the box office. I will definitely be checking out the other films from director Martin Scorsese.

4.0 out of 5 stars Passable. But, it's good. Format: Blu-ray | Verified Purchase Overall, I think "The Aviator" is a good movie, but it could be better. I am a big fan of Scorsese's work, so I'm predisposed to like this one. The story is interesting and the cast is great, but the movie could have used more memorable scenes and more consistent direction. The DVD features are ok and the film looks pretty good (as far as I can tell, being a non-audiophile), but the extras are a bit weak in comparison. They only include about 3 minutes of footage, and the commentary is just a few minutes of good
 I have said before that I'm a huge fan of movie adaptations of novels. It's a good way to get a new spin on a story, and sometimes, you get a movie that doesn't follow the book at all. "The English Patient" is one of those movies. It's not a fair movie, per se. But it's still a pretty darned good movie. Anthony Hopkins is a very good thief, and the film is interesting, at least through the first half. I was initially turned off by the fact that he falls in love with a woman he's stolen from. But the relationship between the two of them is very believable, and the way he falls in love with her is very romantic. It's a good movie, and I'll probably see it again. It's not as good as "Titanic", but then again, "Titanic" was a much better movie.

 The first time I saw this movie I was a teenager and thought it was the best movie I had ever seen. I was so wrong. I saw it again when I was a young adult and it was still so good. I just recently saw it again and I still enjoyed it quite a bit. It's really funny and I love how the band members are so likeable and not so cool. I also love how it is so much like the music that I love.<br /><br />I know people whine about this movie being on the same level as all of the other 80's movies that everyone loves so much, but, I think this movie is a lot better and I don't think it's better because it's on the same level of movies like "Blues Brothers" or "Grease" or "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". I think it's better because it's so real and honest. This movie captures the honesty of the 80's music and it's just so funny and so true. I don't know why nobody has heard of this movie! I think it's great!

 I didn't think I would find a movie as good as this one in the new millennium. I'm not a hard-core horror fan, but the genre is one of my favorites. "The Ring" is a fantastic coming-of-age horror movie that everyone should see at least once. I found myself wondering how the filmmakers could possibly produce a movie as well-crafted as this, and I was completely stuck by the end of it. The story is well-paced, the characters are believable, the dialog is exceptionally well-written, the cinematography is great, the special effects are perfectly executed, and the movie is just plain scary. I found myself looking over my shoulder and checking my pockets after the movie was over. I highly recommend it.

 This movie is terrific. Its not just another musical/comedy, nor just another romance. It has great acting, a great story, a great message. It shows the importance of friendship, the power of love and the importance of family. I loved it and I am a little bit obsessed with the characters. I have bought all the movies to the series and I have gotten all the books, so I know all the songs and I have all the DVDs. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good, fun movie with a good message. 10/10

This is one of my favourite films. It has everything a great film should have: a brilliant story, some great acting, a great storyline and great characters. It has the right amount of romance and humour. It doesn't have too much of either. It is a great film for both boys and girls. You don't have to be a girl to appreciate it. I thought it was a very good
 I saw the movie first and really liked it, but I didn't realize it was based on a novel until I read it in the book store. I like the movie better than the book: The characters are more developed, and the dialog is more relaxed. The book is better for those who want a more intellectual, literary experience. I really enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it to those who enjoy good acting, especially from the supporting roles.

The movie is mostly about the relationship between the narrator, a Russian émigré, and his American wife of many years. The narrator's wife is a compulsive writer, and at one point she has a car accident that threatens to end her life because of her physical pain. The narrator gets her to write again and she slowly regains her health. The movie is about their relationship, which is rather strained, because of their differences in personality, and because of the differences in their time in Russia. The movie is about redemption and forgiveness, and the way that people can change and grow.

<br /><br />I saw this movie because I already liked the director's work and I wanted to see the movie he wrote. I am glad I did.


 A friend of mine who watched this movie gave it a 9/10 but I had to give it a 7.5/10. The only reason I gave it a 7.5 is because the storyline was alright. The actors were great, but the storyline wasn't interesting at all. The only reason why I thought that it was alright is because of the director's style. If you liked "Saved!" or "Sleepless in Seattle", you'll love "Working Girl"<br /><br />I would recommend this to teenagers who like romantic comedies and also to adults.

(5 out of 5 stars)

"Working Girl" is one of the best romantic comedies of the 90's. When I saw the trailer, I thought the movie would be boring but I was wrong. The storyline was so good and the cast was great. I would go to see it again. I recommend it to young teens and adults.

 At the end of the war, German soldiers are put on trial for crimes committed against civilians. One of the accused, Max (Emilio Estevez), is a good-hearted though naive man who falls in love with the beautiful, rich Jewish woman, Lola (Anjelica Huston). It is a love affair that almost ruins him. Lola's family has a dark past and seems to be a bit schizophrenic; she is connected to the Nazis as both a spy and as a victim.<br /><br />This is a powerful film about the fates of the innocent and the guilty in wartime. It is also a very well-made film with a strong sense of style. Estevez is excellent as the young man who falls in love with a woman whose family was one of the leading families of the Nazi Party. Huston is also very good as the woman who is drawn to the young soldier.<br /><br />This is an excellent anti-war film with a very powerful message.

A Wonderful Anti-War Film

Author: akb-chris19
 It was a good movie, but it was WAY overrated. If you don't have a good reason to watch this movie, or a very good reason to see this film, then there is no reason for you to see this movie in the first place. I did not like this film, I did not like the movie, I did not like the idea of making such a movie, the acting was not that good, the story was not that good, and the idea of the story was not that good.

My favourite movie, but not the best.

 I just bought this movie on a whim. I love it. It's about two brothers who shot a video for some girl who was a friend of their sister and she passed away, and then they are out of money and they need to make money, so they make it. I love this movie. It's so cute and funny and cute. I love it. I love the actors in this movie. It's so good. I like the actors they have in this movie, they are good and they are funny. I love the characters, they are funny and I've never seen them before. I like the character the brother has, he is funny.

 Jules Dassin's "The Trial of Joan of Arc" is one of his better efforts as director, and one of the best of all time in terms of the subject matter. We have the second-best film ever made about Joan of Arc, right after the first-best film ever made about Joan of Arc ("Joan of Arc" by Carl Theodor Dreyer). This film is the second-best film ever made about the French Revolution, after the first-best film ever made about the French Revolution ("The Battle of Algiers" by Gillo Pontecorvo). In many ways, "The Trial of Joan of Arc" is a tribute to Dreyer's masterpiece, not only in terms of the subject matter, but in terms of the two-hundred-and-sixty-five-minute running time. Dassin manages to use all this time to really flesh-out his characters, to really lay out the themes, and to really show us the inner life of the characters, without ever feeling scattershot or redundant. He also manages to make a few very, very good films that are very unlike his other films, but which are nevertheless very, very good films in their own right
 I don't know what it is about the music in this movie, but I love it. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be a horrible movie, but when I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised. The music was very reminiscent of Dean Martin's, and the singing was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I thought it was very well done. I'm not sure if there are any other movies that have music that I like so much, but this is one of them.

1/10

Horrible acting, and horrible story line. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this could have been a good one.

1/10

This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had heard that this was a musical, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. There were several scenes that were just terrible and were not worth watching. I did not like this movie at all and wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy.

I haven't seen any of the other movies in this series, but I thought this was a pretty good one.
 A wonderful little story told very well. The young boy Peter is trying to be grown-up, but is still a bit of a kid in many ways. He loves his parents and loves animals, but no matter how hard he tries to be grown-up, he cannot get it quite right. The film has some wonderful scenes, especially where the boy rides his bike and is a bit clumsy. It also shows how Peter loves his parents and will do anything for them. However, he has a problem with his little sister, that she is a bit too bossy and she likes the wrong things. Peter is always very upset when his sister wants to play with his toys, but he will not let her have them. This is a great story and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good film.

This is a really great film. It is a bit like a love story, but it is not just about that. The story has so much to it, and is very interesting. The film is about a 10 year old boy called Peter, and his life at that age. He is a bit of a trouble maker and loves to
 I was delighted to find out that there is a Polish version of the show on HBO. This version is translated into Polish and the plot is completely different from the original version. I've never watched the original version, but I like the Polish version. It tells the story of two lovers and how love can be strong enough to overcome the obstacles in their way.<br /><br />The singing and dancing are great. This show is definitely worth watching.

 This movie is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting, story and score are all excellent. This is the type of film I would savor on a cold winter's night with a glass of red wine. The characters are great and there are a lot of good laughs at the campfire. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible and the story is just not that good. I am not sure why the director made this movie. It seems like he just threw together a bunch of scenes without any real thought. The movie should have been edited down to 40 minutes and then made into a TV movie.

 In the late 18th century, a new kind of novel emerges in France. Called the "Nouvelle," it is a novel of social and political protest. The novel's heroes are peasants and workmen who are struggling to improve their lives. A certain J.K. Huysmans wrote of these people, "They are the people who have begun to move the earth and to change the world, a new generation of rebels, the people who are the hope of the future."<br /><br />This is a film that shows us this new class of people. The film was made by the great director, Jean Rouch, and his wife, Christiane." <br /><br />The film opens with a group of men and women, all wearing red shirts, looking at a group of workers. They are working on a causeway. The workers are dressed in work clothes, and the women are wearing dresses. The workers talk about having to work late into the night for long periods of time, with no pay. The workers are being exploited by the company that owns the causeway. The women are talking about how they will have to give up their children to provide for them. The men are talking about how
 I don't know why so many people complain about the missing scenes from the 2nd movie being in this one, but I think that this movie is awesome. The story is great, and the ending is awesome too. I don't know how my friends are going to react to this movie, but I am defiantly going to see it again. They just don't get it. If you have seen the first movie, then you have to see this one. I did not like the first one as much, but I think that this one is better. If you have not seen the first one, then I don't think you should see this one. I like the first one better than this one, but this movie was still great. There is this one part where the slugs get out of their cage and they eat some people. So if you don't like that kind of stuff, then you shouldn't see this movie.

 This is one of the earliest of these films that I have seen, but I am glad I finally saw it. I thought it was great. The story is very simple, but I think that is what made it great. It is a story about a man who is trapped in a house and can't escape. He finds out that the house is haunted and that there is more to it than meets the eye. The story is very interesting. The characters are great, especially the brother and sister who are trapped in the house. It is also scary at times. I think it was a very good movie. I haven't seen other films with this same story, but I think it is one of the more interesting stories. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this type of film.

 I remember seeing this movie the first time in the theatre, when it came out. It was the first time I really saw a movie for the first time at the theatre, and I was hooked. When I first saw it, I thought that it was absolutely brilliant. It was so funny, and just so well-written and well acted. It made me laugh, and I was also very moved by the story. I love this movie, and I give it six stars out of five.

I love the fact that the book is based entirely on a true story. I think that this is one of the best stories about bullying that I have read. The book is about a kid named Barry who is bullied, and he finally gets his revenge. I think that everyone needs to read this book, and I also think that everyone needs to see the movie because I think that it's a great movie. I think that kids would also like it, because it's a great movie for kids.

In my opinion, this movie has no flaws. It's so good, and I love it. I would also recommend this film to other people, and I think that my friends would also like it. I think that this film is

I was laughing at the first scene of the movie, the girl in the bathroom. I thought the movie was a little dark but I didn't mind it. The movie was good and it was a good idea to make a movie like this. It was just a little weird and sad. The was a scene where there was a dog and it was playing with a girl. It was weird but funny.

 I tried so hard to resist watching this movie. I'd heard so many bad things about it, I just didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong.<br /><br />The subject matter is a bit brutal. The movie is about a man who has spent his entire life trying to fit in (a person with a borderline personality disorder) and how he is forced to deal with the truth that he's a leper, with no friends and no family, to be confronted with the truth that he's the only one who may be able to save the world.

 I always liked the idea of this film, it is set in the future, but not that far in the future. the idea of a woman who gets pregnant is not new, but the idea of her being the only survivor of a massacre, and that the baby is created in a cryogenic lab, makes it a little different. I liked the acting, especially the acting of the two children, who both were really great. I have to say that is was a little slow in the beginning, but it picked up and got good as it went along. I would recommend this film.

 The movie is about a boy who moves to the country. He is a very talented piano player and the only one in his town. That's the reason he is invited to play at the city's Christmas concert. The movie is very sweet and full of music. We have great songs like "I saw mommy kiss Santa Claus" and "Santa Baby". The movie also has a twist at the end and is a great family movie to watch. I recommend this movie to everyone.

 This is a much better movie than it has any right to be. It's especially good for anyone who has ever been in a band. It feels like a documentary and it gives you a very clear look at the "rock star" mentality. The movie is actually based on the book by the same name by Alex Beggs and it's a very accurate portrayal of what it's like to be in a band. The movie is paced very well and the acting is good. I really only have one thing I would change and that is that they didn't give the movie a happy ending. I think that the end of the movie should have been much more of a positive ending. But all in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever been interested in music, especially musicians.

 In this movie there is something that I never felt before: the unusual sensation of fear. It is not a fear in the sense that we are afraid of the monster or the villain, but a fear of being afraid. It is a feeling that you can't describe, but that is really there, so much so that I can't see it being done again any better. It is a very effective movie, and I don't think that this is a movie that a number of people will like. It is a movie that those who love it will love, and those who do not will think that it is really strange.

The movie starts with a scene in which a man wakes up in a motel, and is forced to check into the room. He is terrified, and as he tries to get away, he is attacked by the strange looking man. Through the man's eyes, we see a series of flashbacks to the strange events that we have just seen. He is shown a series of dates, and the man is told that everything was going to be fine. The man is then shown with a woman and a little boy, and the man is told that the woman and the boy are his family. The man is sick and tired
 This is my favorite movie which I have seen so far. It has a good story and it is not scary, which I like. The characters in the movie are very likeable and funny. I enjoyed the part where they were at the amusement park and went on roller coasters. I thought the part of the movie where they were on the roller coaster was my favorite part of the whole movie.

 The first time I saw this film I was stunned. I thought it was among the best movies of all time. I couldn't understand why it hadn't been a huge success. I had heard about it from a friend who was a huge fan of the film. I saw it on a cable station and was amazed by the acting and the story. The characters were so well acted and so real. I couldn't believe what I was watching. I was instantly hooked. I have owned this film on VHS for years, but never bothered to get it on DVD. I was so excited to find it at the video store to buy. I was sure I was going to be disappointed. I was wrong. The video quality is great, even better than on VHS. The sound is almost as good. The picture is crystal clear. The actors are all well casted. The script is excellent. I am amazed at how well it is still holds up today. When I first saw this film I didn't think it was too over the top, but I have to say that I think it is. There is really not an over the top moment in the movie. They play everything so well. The whole story is so believable. I think
 This movie has a great cast, a decent script, and a story that is fun and exciting. This movie has the kind of action that never gets old. It's great to see the old cast again, including the late great Donald Pleasance. Cameron Diaz, who plays the lead role, has a great screen presence and a kind of sexiness to her that makes her seem all the more mean. This is a fun, fast paced movie. I highly recommend it to anyone.

 This is a mystery-thriller film with many twists and turns and excellent characterizations. The casting is brilliant, the plot is clever and the whole thing is a page-turner. The movie is so good, it is hard to find anything to fault. Which is a real shame because there is much to criticize. First off, the script is rather slow. My guess is that Faulks wanted to keep the pace slow for so as not to overburden the viewer with too much information too quickly. While this is fine as a general principle, it does leave the viewer wanting to know more about the characters and the plot. There is a lot of character development in this film but the characters are never fully developed. The best characters of the movie are the ones who are not given a lot of screen time and the ones who are given screen time are not fleshed out. The film also suffers by not being entirely clear. I understand that Faulks is trying to make a mystery-thriller but he is not entirely successful. The film is quite puzzling when it comes to the paradoxes and the characterizations. Some of the twists and turns are reasonable, some are not. Some of the characterizations are spot on
 I did not like the first one and was wondering if I would like this one. I found it to be a better film than the first, which I found to be more typical of the typical horror films that come out. It could have used a little more gore and more effective acting, but I can't complain too much about the story. The acting was decent and the gore was very good. I really enjoyed it. I would probably go see it again.

I hated this movie!! I don't even know how to talk about it. The acting was the worst. If you want to see a good horror movie go see the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I would not ever go see
 This movie is awesome. I got it for about $10 at a yard sale and I still think it was worth it. It's about a girl who lives in a house in which there are all kinds of ghosts who are trying to get her to go out and have a good time, but she doesn't want to because she is a huge nerd, but when she has no other choice she goes out. I think this is a great movie for anyone who is interested in ghosts and anything else that is fantasy.

I really liked the effects in this movie, they are really good and they don't look like they made them up. I think it was a good movie and it was worth getting. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy, but I think that it is for girls more than boys. I would say that it is about PG.

I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and I would like to see more movies like this.

 "Baby's Day Out" is a genuinely funny, sweet and charming film, with some of the most endearing characters you'll meet. The humor is generally subtle and situational, but it's always there, and it's always funny.<br /><br />Jenny (Natalie Portman) and her best friend, Mary (Malin Åkerman), live in New York City and are about the same age. Mary's mother (Estelle Parsons) is a busy, overbearing stage mother, who has to be seen by her before she will even consider letting Mary go to auditions. Jenny lives with her father, and as a result, is subject to his less than saintly behavior. Her father is a man of few words, and a very busy one, but has always been there for her - and she loves him dearly. One day, Jenny's father hires a babysitter, and when she comes to pick the kids up, she discovers the babysitter is a woman who has a very bad attitude, and a lot of attitude. She's condescending, and spends more time trying to be cool than actually doing her job.<br /><br />Jenny doesn't like this lady one bit, and
 I was a "fan" of the old TV series "The Twilight Zone" when it first came out in the 60's. I loved the idea of a show where the show was an anthology-type series that featured stories based on true scenarios. Through the years, I've seen it on a number of times. While I've always enjoyed it, I never quite got into it. But, I always felt that it was somewhat of a letdown. I didn't think it was as good as the old series and I knew that it was only an hour long. But I went back to see it again and had a lot of fun. I guess I was so accustomed to the old series I had gotten used to it and when the new series came along I just could not understand it. The new "Twilight Zone" is much better than the old one. The first episode, which deals with a man who can hear his parents voices in his head, and his fear that he's going crazy is a great story. We do have the same thing with the exception of the fact that his parents are dead. In the old series, his parents were alive. The second episode, which deals with a man who is successful in business,
 This is a very nice film, but I was hoping more for a story of a country boy who goes to college and then starts his own business. Maybe the young man had a violent crime record, but I expect that to be explained in the film. I did not like the ending of the film where the young man gets a job with the police department and nobody in his family is surprised. Why not? I had hoped he would get into the business and then get a job with his father in law's company, but he didn't. Why?

I have been in the business for over 40 years and I believe that the police department is one of the most unglamorous places to work, but with a lot of training, a person can go from the beat to being a detective. I had hoped this young man would be able to stand on his own two feet.

The young man was very likable, but I was hoping for a little more depth to his character.

I am giving the film a 7 because the story line was very good and I loved the story of the young man starting his own business.

I recommend this film to anyone who likes good stories about people who want to succeed
 The story is of two sisters who were left fatherless in the deep South, who see a lynching and decide to save the man from the mob, and get caught in a web of politics and social conventions. The cast is superb, especially the young black girl who plays the older sister, whose vocal power is so amazing that she tears the heart out of the story. One of the most memorable movies I ever saw.

 "The Big Blue" is an American film from the early '60's that was directed by Mark Robson and stars the great Robert Mitchum. Set in the Florida Keys, this is one of those seaside adventures that are so popular in beach movies of the time. It's about a simple man who's just arrived at the Keys on vacation and begins to get involved in a murder plot. The film is well-written and has a good cast of supporting players. It's not a great film, but it's good fun. It's particularly exciting to see Robert Mitchum as a younger man in this film. If you like "The Big Sleep", this is a great film to see.

 This was one of the first movies that I saw on TV when I was about five or six years old. I had never seen a movie before and I was very excited to see it. The movie was very exciting and I was hooked from the first minute.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I could not get enough of it and when I had the chance I would watch it again. I enjoyed the part when the little boy got chased by the monster and the part where he would run through the water. I really liked the part where werewolfs would come and scare people and when the little boy got chased by them and the part when the man got his head cut off. I rated it a 10.<br /><br />I have seen this movie so many times that I can remember when it was made and when it first came out and I can remember what year it was made and it is a very good movie. I remember when it first came out. I also remember because I saw it on TV when I was about five or six years old and I have watched it so many times.<br /><br />Overall, I rate this movie a 10.<br /><br />Sincerely, Caleb

 I love this movie. It is probably my favourite of all the Jim Henson movies. I love the characters and they are so cute. I think that the only other movie that I like as much as this is The Land of the Koopas. It is a super fun movie, with a great plot. I think that it is great because it has a lot of action, but it is also very funny. It is funny, because of the characters. I think that this movie is great, because of the fairy tales. I also think that this movie is great, because of the songs. I think that they are great, because they make you feel good. I also think that this movie is great because of the actors, who played the characters. I especially like Manny's character, because he is funny and cool. I like that there is a lot of action in this movie, because it makes it more exciting. I also like that this movie is funny, because that makes it more fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to everyone, who likes Henson movies or fairy tales. I think that everyone should see this movie. I would rate this movie 10/10.

 Filled with beautiful images of Italian countryside, this Italian film has some nice moments and some very good acting. The plot revolves around a young man from the mountains who is sent to the city by his father to make a name for himself. There he meets a girl and falls in love with her. He is too afraid to tell her about his true identity, so instead he tells her that he is a friend of her brother. This keeps things interesting and the viewer will enjoy this film. This is a film that is worth watching.

 I watched this movie tonight - I'm having a really great time.<br /><br />The movie is really interesting because it's not just a movie - it's a story in which the characters grow from one day to the next. It's a little bit of an "anime" movie, but it's also a real movie that you can enjoy. It's not that it's so good that it's not something for everybody, but it's a movie for everybody - it's not just for the young, for the teenagers, for the children. It's for everybody, so everybody can enjoy it.

I think it's a great movie for the whole family. I think it's a good movie for older people, too, because it's a movie that can be enjoyed by everybody, and there's no one who won't like it. I think it's a great movie and it was really interesting to watch. I think it's a great movie, but I don't know why it wasn't nominated for an Oscar. I think it deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. I think it's a great movie, and I think a lot of people would also think that it's a great movie.

 I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and absolutely loved it. I'd seen the original movie when it came out in theaters, and had a very difficult time with it. I didn't understand it at all, and it was a very hard movie to sit through. But I thought the director had made a very good film with this remake. It was maybe a little too "clever" in some parts, but overall the movie was very good. The acting was very good, and it was a very suspenseful film. I thought it was a better film than the original. I have to hand it to the director: he did a great job with the film. The highway chase at the end was really suspenseful, and I also thought the way the film was shot was really good. The film really was full of action. I thought the director did a very good job with this film. I thought the plot was very good, and I thought the director did a very good job of actually making this movie a very good film, when the original movie was a very hard film to sit through. It was a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone.

 The Muppets are in the news again. This time they are in the news for being a part of the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Atlanta. I have to admit that I was not aware that they were in the news. I was unaware that they had been a part of the opening ceremonies. I was unaware that they had been a part of any opening ceremonies. I was unaware that they were the Muppets. I was unaware that they were the Muppets. I was unaware that they were the Muppets.<br /><br />But then I was unaware of a lot of things, so I guess I should not be surprised that I was unaware of the Muppets, too. But then I did know them, and then I did not know them. And now I do know them and then I do not know them again.<br /><br />The Muppet Show is my first exposure to the Muppets. I do not remember when I first saw it, but I do remember that it was on TV and that I watched it. The Muppets were funny and cute and so were their friends. The Muppets were not my type of cartoon characters. I did not like the
 I have seen this movie a couple of times now and have to admit that it is pretty damn great. It's not a very original movie, but nevertheless it is brilliant. The story is original, the acting is excellent, it has tons of humor and great music. Yes, it's basically a very simple Hollywood comedy, but it's still great. And it's hilarious.<br /><br />See this movie, you won't be disappointed.

 This film is great for parties, especially if you have a huge tube TV and surround sound system, or if you have a large TV screen. It has a lot of good humor, and the plot is pretty good. It's not the best film in the world, but it's certainly good for a laugh or two. If you're looking for a good party film, this is it. I'd give it a 7.5/10.

 I love this movie! I love how the story develops and how the characters grow. The music is fabulous and I especially love the songs that are sung by the main character. I also love the performance of the main character. Loved it! Loved it!

The movie is based on the true story of a family who moved to Alaska to live a life in nature. A life that they believe will be better than the one they left. The family starts a life in Alaska, but they soon realize that they are not prepared for the life they are living there. They start to realize that the life they moved to Alaska for was a lie and that they live the life they dreamed about but never expected to happen. They then start to write about their experiences and the results are great. The story is incredible and the movie is just as good. I loved the movie and I loved the story. I also loved the way the movie was told, it was very original. It was a great movie, but if you are looking for a movie that is easy to watch, this is not the movie for you. This movie is very hard to watch because it is all so real. At moments the movie is so hard to watch. It
 I saw this film and it was absolutely brilliant. I have enjoyed the series since the first time I saw an episode and I have tried to catch every single one that has appeared since. The film was basically the same as the series with a few new scenes thrown in. The acting was excellent, the story was good, the action was cool, the humour was good and the special effects were alright but not amazing. I couldn't think of anything that I didn't like about this film and I thought it was a very good film and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and science fiction.<br /><br />-Lily

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

Author: Gwen White from United Kingdom

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The Good: The story, plot and plot twists were very good. The acting was great as usual from everyone involved not to mention the CGI effects.



The Bad: The same as a lot of people have been saying, the plot is a bit confusing and the characters could have been developed even more
 I read the book "The Bell Jar" and was totally disappointed by it. I've seen the movie and I think that it's better than the book. It's more interesting. If you're looking for a good book to read, go to the library and get a book of short stories. I'm sure you'll like it. Well, I didn't like the book because it was too short.

But that's the only bad thing I can say about the movie. I love it. It's very realistic. I think that if I ever become a writer, I would love to make a movie based on my book.

The main character, Gloria, is very inspiring. I would definitely recommend this movie. You'll love it.

See this movie if you have time!

10/10

P.S. The movie is based on the book. If you haven't read the book, you won't know the ending.

P.S.S. I watched the movie on September 10th, 1999.

 I was a huge fan of the film "The Big Lebowski" when it first came out, and have been a fan of the Coen brothers since I saw "Blood Simple." This film was no exception. I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers' work, and this film is no different. It's a great film, it's very funny, the acting is great and I will say that I laughed hard throughout the film. I highly recommend this film to any fan of comedy, or perhaps anybody who loves film. I just can't get enough of this film, in fact, I am now a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, and they are now my favorite directors.

 I went to see this film with my sister. We both enjoyed it very much and it was better than I expected. I'm a fan of the film "The Seventh Seal" and I love the commentaries of the film critic and the way you see the film evolve. I thought "The Seventh Seal" was a movie about death, but I didn't realize it was about the death of the old world. This movie is called "The Seventh Seal" and that's what it all about. I also thought that the film "The Seventh Seal" was very gory, but I didn't realize that this movie was more than just a little gory. I didn't know that the movie was so realistic, and I didn't know that the actors were so good. I knew that this was a movie about war, but I didn't know that it was about the war between our old world and the new world. I saw this film in a theatre in the city of Toronto, and I don't think you could see it in a theatre in Toronto and also in your living room. I think it's best to see this film in a theatre. I was also very impressed with the commentaries. I have seen a lot of comment
 The first episode of this series is a real gem. It's so well told, the sets, the props, the actors, the costumes and the music, all come together to give this young man a lifetime of love and happiness. From the opening scene, where the camera is slowly panning over the young man's mother, who is reading a letter to him, you know this is going to be a special episode. Then, when the young man joins his father in the fields, you know he is going to get a special Christmas present. The music, the wonderful story, the wonderful acting and the wonderful message will have you crying on your way to the kitchen.<br /><br />This episode is great and it sets a high standard for the whole series.

5.0 out of 5 stars Made Me Cry!

I have never seen a Christmas Special that made me cry before. It is beautifully written, acted and filmed. The whole thing is a very touching love story and a very beautiful film on its own.

I highly recommend it to everyone.

This is one of my favorite Christmas Specials!!!! I love it so much and I love
 This is a great documentary about a great person. Harvey Milk is a hero to me. I remember watching this documentary on PBS when I was a little kid. I remember thinking how courageous he was to try to get the gay and lesbian community to be treated equally. I remember thinking that he would not be the first gay person to be elected to public office but would be the first to make it happen. I remember how sad I was when he was assassinated in 1978. I remember thinking how great it would be if he were still alive today. I was really shocked that he was killed. I remember how shocked and sad I was when I heard that he was killed because of a shooting by a radical gay man. I remember thinking how great it was when I heard that he was reincarnated as a character in a Broadway play. I remember how great it was when I learned that he was born again as a character in a movie. I remember thinking how great it was when I heard that he is a character in a TV series. This is a great documentary.

10/10

I have to give this a 10/10. It is a true story. It is a very sad story. It is a very inspiring story.
 I was so excited to see this film, and before I seen it, I was thinking how it would be bad, and how it was going to be a good movie. So, I went to see it and I was very surprised, I thought it was a great movie!! It had a lot of action and it was very funny. But it also had a good story line. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies.

<br /><br />P.S. I am a girl, and I love this movie because it has a lot of action and great humor.

<br /><br />P.P.S. I'm 14 years old, and I think this movie is great.

<br /><br />P.P.P.S. I can't wait for the next Harry Potter movie!

<br /><br />P.P.P.P.S. If you happen to see this movie, you should go see it, and you should see it again, that's if you like this movie.

<br /><br />P.P.P.P.P.S. I'm going to see the next
 My dear friends, this movie was awesome! "I'm not a man... I'm a beast" is so true. I am very surprised at all the bad reviews this movie has gotten, it's actually a pretty good movie. I'm going to keep this short and sweet. It was a great movie, and I thought everyone would enjoy it! The movie is about "Frankie" a werewolf who is a police officer. He is trying to keep his secret to himself and his fellow officers. He also has a huge secret that will soon be revealed. The movie is really good, and I hope that you all enjoy it! I hope that this movie gets more recognition and more views, because it's really a good movie! I really hope that the sequel is made!

 This is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it dozens of times, and it always brings a smile to my face. I am not a huge fan of the Bond movies because I find them to be too raunchy for my taste, and I just don't really like Sean Connery as Bond. However, I think this movie is great, and I love it. It is a bit of a different story than the other Bond movies, and it is very believable. I think it is a great movie, and I am happy that it is on DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the James Bond movies, but doesn't like the raunchy stuff.<br /><br />

James Bond is back in a new and better way!

Author: (Thomas_K) from Phoenix, Arizona, United States

The spy film is a classic genre, that's no more. And after the many mediocre attempts, "James Bond- The Spy Who Loved Me" is a breath of fresh air. The
 This is my most favorite movie of all time. It has everything you want in a movie, with a setting in the cozy city of London, with the mystery of the film and the romantic story, with the cat and the mouse, with the cat and the dog. It is a great story for children and for adults. It was one of the most memorable movies I have seen. I would love to see this movie again, this time with my family in the cinema. I would also love to do some reenactments with the movie.

In my opinion this movie is not only for children, but also for adults. It is a movie that everyone can enjoy. The acting is great and the story is different and exciting. I love the suspense and the fact that we do not know who the cat is and the dog is. The fact that the cat keeps on playing with the mouse, is also great and funny.

The movie is not only fun, but also interesting. The cat and the mouse are like one another, so it is interesting to see who will be the mouse and who will be the cat. I think that this movie is a great family movie.

I think that this movie is a great
 Just a note: The title is French for "Try and do your best". I'm French, and I don't think that's in any way offensive! At least in my opinion, as a francophile. The title is meant as a sort of joke on a common phrase in French, meaning something like "you can try, but you'll probably fail". The real question is whether or not you'll succeed. This movie, in the most positive sense, is about a bunch of students, their professor and their professor's family, all in their final years of high school, who want one last adventure in life together...and possibly a love story. The professor's daughter is a very cute girl, as is the main character, and the professor's three sons, who are all very cute as well. I would say that the professor's wife is probably one of the cutest people in the movie. There are a lot of cute guys in the movie, and it is easy to tell that the main character will eventually be with the cutest guy. There are also a lot of cute girls in the movie, and it is easy to tell that the main character will eventually be with the cutest girl. The professor's daughter is definitely
 I'm going to give this movie a 10 out of 10, it's not a horror movie but it's so scary that you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The acting is great and the fight scenes are a little over the top but that's what makes this movie so good. The movie is basically about a young boy named Nathan who is trying to find his dad and his dad's girlfriend, when he finds them he learns alot of things. This movie shows the consequences of a young boy killing someone by his dad. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys thrillers or scary movies.

 What a great movie! i watched it last week and it was so intense! and very interesting story. i am not a fan of the movie, but i am a fan of the book. so i greatly recommend watching it. If you like mystery, suspense, thriller and a little bit of romance, you'll love it. The story is about a girl who moves to a new city and meets some strange people. she becomes friends with a boy and they both have different personalities. they get kidnapped and the story gets pretty crazy. i think it's a good movie to watch when you don't know what to watch. It's not a bad movie, just not my type of movie. It's a nice fantasy movie to watch. If you want to watch it, i give it a 6/10.

 This is an outstanding film. I am from the Philippines and I love to watch it every time it is played in the movie channels. I think, it is the best film ever made. It is so touching, it is about a Filipino family, who is always struggling to survive. The father is a barber, who is always hardworking and he can't afford to give his family a better life. The mother is a house wife, who is a good mother. The son is a hardworking student who is always studying and studying, but he can't afford to pay his tuition. The daughter is the most beautiful girl in the school. The father is always arguing with the son and the son always complains and complains. I was so moved by this film, it's so true, it's always about a family, who has been trying to get a better life. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone. It is a must-see film.

great movie

Author: Pink from Spain

I really enjoyed this movie. It's funny
 "The Punisher" isn't a particularly accurate portrayal of the Punisher, but it is a good example of the kind of film that is popular in the 1980's. I'm not sure why this film was made. I think that it was made to cash in on the popularity of the Punisher comic at the time. The story is about Frank Castle, a veteran of the Vietnam War who is brought back to life by the terrorist group HYDRA in order to take revenge on the U.S. government. The film has many action sequences, but it lacks any character development. The Punisher is shown to be a very ruthless killer, but he also seems to be a very compassionate man. The Punisher was also seen as an anti-social character during the 1980's, but in "The Punisher" he is shown as a man who is very caring and kind. For example, he gives a homeless boy a meal and shows him around. "The Punisher" is a good action film, but it lacks character development. The film is good for people who want to see a good action film with a good plot, but it is not a good film for people who like to see character development. 8/10

 One of the best films of all time, on top of its own merit, is this one. The original is pretty much the masterpiece, but this is a very good film, too. It's a rom-com, a drama, and a musical. The musical numbers are exceptionally beautiful and well-choreographed, and the acting is amazing. The setting is in a big, busy city, and it's very realistic and interesting. The cast is great, too. <br /><br />The story is very original and interesting, and there is a lot of variety in it, too. It's about a girl who gets involved with a man who is a stranger, and it's about her life and the difficulties she has to go through, and the way she deals with them. It's a very deep and meaningful tale. It's a great film, and it's a must-see.

 *Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />This movie came out in 1998, and I saw it in the theatre, with a friend. We both LOVED it. I'm a huge fan of the movie, and I saw it a few other times when it came out on DVD. I've seen it twice more since that first time, and I wanted to see it again.<br /><br />I got to see it tonight, with my husband, and we both agreed it was just as good as it was the first time we saw it.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like about it, was the ending. The ending was very ambiguous, and I didn't really like how it ended. However, I think the original ending, while not the best of them, is better.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who likes romance, and humor.<br /><br />I gave it a 7/10.

 This movie is a good one. I heard that it is based on the novel by John Katzenbach. It is also based on a true story, the story of a guy that either was or could have been the guy that wrote the book. Either way, the story is interesting. I don't want to give anything away. It's a story of the American dream. It's a story of the American dream of being rich and success. It's a story of what happens to the dream when it meets reality. It's a story of the American dream of being one of the elite. It's a story of the American dream of being a hero. It is also a story of the American dream of being a writer.

 I saw this movie at the world cinema association in Luxembourg. I like the fact that it contains so many scenes in different places. For instance, the scene in the big city (Paris) is shot in the same places as in the end, when the students are in the park. It's just a great movie!

And for the people who find the movie boring or too religious, I don't know what to say. I found it very interesting to see this kind of movie. The story is very good, the actors are great, and the message is very clear.

The only thing that I didn't like was the end. At the end of the movie, you see the students in the park and you see a lot of people, but it is not clear who they are. I would like to know more about it, but I think it would be too long and I don't have time for that.

But I would love to see the movie again. I would like to see it in the cinema, but I don't know if they will show it.

In short, I love the movie, I love it very much, and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars!


 The movie is very beautiful, and the ending is not too bad. It is about a boy who is in love with his best friend's girlfriend. He doesn't like her, but he likes her, and wants her to like him. The boy ends up killing himself, and the girl finds out that he did it, but does not tell the police, because it would look bad for her. She tells the boy's father, and the father then kills himself, and the girl's mother, who is a nurse, finds out that the boy's father killed himself, and the mother then dies, and her best friend who is in love with the girl, kills himself. After that, the girl and the boy who killed himself and the girl's mother, go to the beach, and they talk and they become good friends. After that, they go to a restaurant, and they become good friends. And he tells her the truth, and she says she loves him, and they kiss and the end. I thought the movie was very good, and I liked the ending.

 This is the best movie I have ever seen about a woman's battle with breast cancer. The story is told in such a way that one doesn't feel overwhelmed by the subject matter. It is told in such a way that it is easier to understand. I had a friend who was dying of breast cancer and I was able to see the movie several times. I would encourage any woman who has cancer to see this movie.

It is a well-balanced movie about the life of a woman with breast cancer. It is not a movie about someone who is perfectly healthy who suddenly finds out that she has breast cancer. It is a movie about a woman who has lived with breast cancer for a long time and the emotions that she must deal with.

It is a movie about a woman who is trying to deal with her emotions. It is a movie about a woman who is trying to deal with the fact that she is not "perfectly" healthy. It is a movie about a woman who finds out that she is dying while she is trying to find out what she wants to do with the rest of her life.

In my opinion, this movie is not geared toward men. I think that it would be best if someone
 This is a great movie. It's got a good story and it's watchable. It's not great art, but it's a good movie. It's funny, it's playful, and it's well made. It's got a good cast with Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Walken. It's a great cast, and they're all good in their roles. This movie is better than most other comedies, but it's still not as good as a lot of great comedies. It's got a lot of funny moments and it's a great movie for a lot of people. It's worth watching, and it's worth watching more than once.

 This is a great film. I saw this film on cable a few months back, and was not able to get it for several months after, but I finally saw it again, and had the same reaction as the first time. This is a great film that is well written, directed, and acted. The characters are extremely well developed, and you really get to know them. The story is also great. It is a tear jerker, but not too much so. It is a great film to watch with friends and family. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a good story and great acting.

I think everyone should go see this movie. It is so funny and so well acted. I think everyone should go out and see it. I will be recommending this movie to many friends.

 I watched this film a few nights ago, and I can't believe that I haven't seen it before. If you like Vittorio Storaro's work, you'll love this film. Take note that it is NOT an exact replica of the book, but a creative interpretation of it. The film changes his plot, characters and events, but it is a great film. I can't stress enough how great this film is. It is a must-see.

This is a wonderful film, but it is so much better than the book. The film is almost as good as the book, but it is not a direct translation. I highly recommend this film, and if you like the book, you'll love this film. I can't say enough good things about this film, but I will say that I loved it.

 I've seen this movie three times and I loved it each time. I'm a big fan of the 1960s, so I will always love this movie. Aside from the themes and the music, the acting is great, and I've always felt that the best part of this movie is the fact that it doesn't really try to be deep, it just is. It doesn't try to compare the everyday life of normal people with the lives of the rich and famous. It just is. It's a bit simple, but it's still great.

The movie is like a dream. It's a great movie that feels like a dream. It's a dream because it's a movie. I can't emphasize enough how good this movie is. It's not a great movie like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" or "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" or "The Sound of Music." It's just not a great movie. But, it's still a great movie.

I think that this movie could have been very, very different. The movie could have been much more serious and not so much about the music and the girls. It could have been about the music and the girls, but it
 When I was a little girl, I saw this movie in a late night movie theatre. I am a little older now, but I still remember it. It was a great movie. I don't know why I liked it so much, but I did. I just love the movie. <br /><br />The story is about a little girl who has a crush on a boy. She doesn't know why, but she really likes him. She's a little girl, so she doesn't understand the feelings that she has. But one day she goes up to the boy and says, "I like you." He smiles at her and says, "I like you too." It is the first time that he has ever said that to a girl. And then they both get married. The end. <br /><br />I like it because the main character is a little girl. It's very cute. I also like it because it is about a family. It's about a family that has two girls and one boy. It's very interesting. It makes me feel good when I see it. <br /><br />I will always remember that movie. I liked it a lot. <br /><br />
 I saw this film on a late night TV show and was really impressed by it, not just because it's a good horror movie, but also because it's a really good watch. The slow-burn pace and the way the film is directed, is really effective in making you feel the fear, the tension and the terror that the film is trying to convey. The film is beautifully shot, with some incredibly grim and disgusting imagery, which is complemented by a very good script and very good acting, especially from the main star of the film, who really gives the performance of his career in my opinion. The film doesn't try to be a slasher movie, but it does have some pretty gruesome moments and it does have a few scenes that are a little bit gory, but it's rare for horror films to have scenes of this sort, so I think it's probably a good thing to have had these scenes. Overall, this is an excellent film, and I don't think it gets nearly enough credit for it's quality.

Zombie Movie of the Day: If you're looking for a zombie movie that will scare the hell out of you, you've got to watch
 One of the best movies of the 80s, a must for any fan of cinema. In the middle of the 80s, the industry was in decline. Films were being made about the end of the world, about nuclear warfare, about the dangers of space travel. The final frontier had been explored in the 70s and 80s, and nothing was left to do but go back in time. And that's exactly what they did.<br /><br />This movie sends back to the time of the 19th century...the time when the world was new, when people didn't have the right to speak out against any sort of authority. This is a movie about a man who has been sent to Australia, to a prison colony, to do time for a crime he didn't commit. It's a time when people have to be punished for any sort of crime, when the law is merciless, when punishment is brutal and without cause. This is a time when Aboriginal people are considered nothing more than animals.<br /><br />This movie is not just an action-adventure. It's not just about a man's hunt for justice. It's about the cruelty of the law. It's about the cruelty of society. It
 I saw this movie at a recent movie theater showing. I thought it was refreshing and interesting to see a movie where you actually want to know what happens. I think that was the most important thing about this movie. The lack of suspense is what kept the movie from being a "stinker". I've seen a few movies that have been called that, and I know that it's usually because the movie was just bad. This film was just a little different. I have to admit, the ending was a bit of a let down, but it wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for. I had a good time watching this film. I'm sure it will show up on cable at some point soon. It's a good story that plays out well.

The movie is good. It was a little slow at the beginning but it was worth it. It was interesting and the acting was good. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

 I felt this movie was great, I am a huge fan of the "Hobbit" movies and this is right up there. I was a bit worried that it would seem too similar to the movies but I think that it is different enough to be a great movie in it's own right. I really like the special effects, they really do make the movie. The only thing that I didn't like was something that I even found kind of funny: There are a couple of shots where the camera is a bit shaky, this is because the camera operator is actually having a bad time filming the scene and has dropped the camera. This was kind of funny, but it did seem a bit tacky. All in all, I think it was a good movie and I look forward to seeing the next one.

4.0 out of 5 stars Not a bad movie, but not a great one either. Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I enjoyed the movie. I was worried that it would be a cheap imitation of the Lord of the Rings movies, but it was actually quite good. It was a bit too long, but that's a problem with the book too. The acting was very good, the characters were well defined,
 A new twist on the vampire movie genre. The vampire pales in comparison to the young girl in the movie that is the star of the film. She is so awesome that she is the reason to see this film and the reason to watch it a second time. This movie is one of the best vampire movies that I have seen. I think this film deserves more than 10 stars.

6.0 out of 10 stars A good movie with a few flaws.

First off, I think the movie was good, and I liked it. I thought the acting was good, and it was a good story. The story is about a girl that becomes a vampire. Not all vampires are bad, and there is a good vampire in this movie. This vampire is not the typical vampire that is used to scare people. The special effects in the movie are good. The girl is a vampire (she is not the typical vampire used to scare people). I liked the girl, she was cool, and her acting was believable. The girl has to go to a vampire school, and they make her stay. The girl does not want to go to the school, but she has to because she has no choice. The girl is trying to find
 I've been a huge fan of the old Universal monster films for about as long as I can remember. I was 13 when I discovered the original "Frankenstein", and I've been a fan ever since. I've read the stories, watched the movies, and seen the re-releases. I've seen the Lon Chaney films, the Bela Lugosi films, the Boris Karloff films, and the George Remis films. I've seen them all over and over again. I even have a copy of the "Boris Karloff's Frankenstein" that was made up from the original (and more colorful) novel by Mary Shelley and the film by James Whale. And I have to say, "Bride Of Frankenstein" is one of my favorite of the old Universal films. The special effects are just amazing, and the actors are all excellent. I can't say enough good things about this film. I always get a smile on my face when I see it, and I always get a kick out of the singing "I'm The King Of The Mummy's" scene.<br /><br />I have to say that the only problem I have with "Bride" is that it's a re-make. I mean
 I was surprised by the beginning of this movie. I didn't expect at all a movie like this. It's a horror, but not so graphic. The story is very simple, but the movie is as good as a horror movie can get. The acting is good. The girls in the movies are hot, and the guy is perfect. I appreciated the ending of the movie, but I don't know if it was a good decision. The movie is interesting and funny, but I had a problem with the subtitles. I don't know the language, so I had to read the subtitles all the time, and it was hard to understand them. But all in all, it's a great movie to watch, with a good ending.

I think the movie is too simple and it could have been done in better ways. But I like the fact that it is short, it doesn't have a long, boring plot. It is a very good performance by the actors, and the fact that you get five minutes of each character's story is very interesting. I think it would have been a great film if it had been longer, but then again, it wouldn't have been "The Festival".

 I have a special place in my heart for the Monkey's Paw (1938). I remember watching it on television when I was a child. I loved the twist ending where a young man was sacrificed in order to help the young woman. I remember watching the different endings and wondering which was the real ending. I still have the same questions today. I also remember being scared by the monkey's paw. I remember watching it as a child and my father saying that the monkey's paw was a real object. I always wondered what the monkey would look like if you took the paw out of the box. I will never forget the monkey's paw.

The Monkey Paw still looks good today. Author: R. D. from Canada

22 September 2005



In 1938, a film called "The Monkey's Paw" was released. It was a classic, and was based on a short story by W.W. Jacobs. The film, directed by Roy William Neill, starred Basil Rathbone, Bela Lugosi, and Charles Laughton as three friends who, for a laugh, decide to play a
 I've been a fan of the original series (from the days of my youth) and I just loved the "new" series. They were smart and funny, and they made me laugh more than any other show on TV (even The Simpsons). They left the "grandpa" jokes to the cartoons and they showed us the real world, where people really work hard, have real problems, and just need a break from the "More on this later." They also had some of the best guest appearances ever on TV. God, if only they had a Season 6, 7 or 8, but unfortunately it's been the end of the line for them. I wonder if they'll ever make a movie, or make another season? I hope so, because I'll be waiting for it. I'd be disappointed if it wasn't made.

I would like to direct your attention to the character of Bob Sweeney, played by the great Peter Scolari. He is a used car salesman who is always coming up with jokes to make his customers laugh. He is one of the best characters in the show. I would also like to mention the character of Mr. Crowe, played
 It's interesting to me that this film was made in the mid-1970s, and it shows. The film is not a masterpiece. It does tend to drag at times, and the musical numbers are too long & unnecessary. But it's a good, entertaining film. There are a number of cameo performances in the film, and there are a few surprises that make this a film to see. I had heard this was a John Waters film, but I didn't realize it was a fairly poor Waters film. This film is one that is much more entertaining than a lot of Waters' films, and is not nearly as offensive as most of his films. If you are a fan of Waters, you'll want to see this film. If you are not a fan of Waters, you will probably be a little disappointed. I'm a fan of Waters, but I was disappointed.

 I have seen this movie twice, and I have been to see it both times in the theater. The first time I saw the movie I thought it was a little slow and that the story line was a little odd. But I have to say when I saw the movie a second time I was totally captivated by the story line and the unusual characters that play a big part in the movie. I am also amazed at how well the movie was acted and how good the special effects were. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is into good movies and likes to see something different. I think that this movie is going to make it big in the movie industry, because it has a very unique story line that you haven't seen before.

Also, I also recommend this movie to anyone who likes to go to the movies and see something different. I have to say that I think this movie is very original and that I have never seen anything like it before. I think that anyone who likes to see a good movie should check out this movie, because I think that you will be surprised at what you see on the big screen.

I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

"All that glitters is not gold
 The Main Plot:<br /><br />A young boy is tricked into heading to a creepy old house with his friends. Once there, they are attacked by a man in a clown mask. The friends are then locked in the house where they are forced to play a twisted game of hide and seek with the ghost of a man that looks exactly like their friend. The ghost of the man then kills one of their friends, and the boy escapes. Once he is out of the house, he is then chased by the ghost of the clown, and is saved by his friend's mother, who has been investigating the haunting.<br /><br />The Main Plot is really boring, but the subplots are great. The friend's mother is played by Ellen Barkin, and she is very funny in this film. Another great character is played by Jennifer Rubin. She plays a young girl who was in the house with the friends. The friends are played by Cody Linley, Keith Coogan and Alan Ruck. The three friends are great actors, and Kyle has a very funny character. Overall, the movie is very funny and is one of the best horror films ever made.

Then I went out and bought the DVD and was very impressed by the picture quality, the soundtrack and the overall presentation of the film.

 I found this movie to be a very pleasant surprise. I don't usually enjoy movies like this because in the past I've found that most films about the Holocaust are either very overly dramatic and melodramatic, or very watered down, so that it's hard to really take them seriously. This movie, however, is different. It was not overly dramatic and was actually very well done. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies about the Holocaust and wants to see a film that is actually very well done.

I could be wrong, but I don't think that I will ever be able to get past the fact that the writers of this movie had a conversation with the director and said, "This movie is so funny-let's make it awful." I think they were right.

This review is from: The Last Kiss (DVD)

I just had to review this movie. I am a huge fan of Mandy Moore, and this movie is so good. It is a story about a girl named Michelle who is in love with her best friend's boyfriend, Eric. Michelle wants to make a move, but everytime she does, something bad seems to happen. This movie is a great one, and I recommend it to all of you.


 I saw this movie at a film festival and was really impressed by it. It was a really great story and it was done really well. I think that it had a good mix of drama, comedy, and action. It was a really good movie, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the way that the movie was written. I thought that it was a bit too much and it seemed to be a little bit too dark and too much violence. Sometimes it seemed a bit over the top. I also thought that the movie got a bit too violent at times. I also thought that the movie was a little too long. I think that it was a great movie, but I think that some parts of it could have been shortened a little bit. Overall, I think that it was a great movie, but I wouldn't say that it was a great movie for all audiences.

 After seeing this movie I was upset. I had just looked up the phone number of the person who had made the film and called her. I was very excited to tell her that she had done a great job, but she didn't have a clue what I was talking about. It was a very tough movie to watch. The story was very hard to handle for me. I didn't want to say too much about the movie because I was afraid I would ruin it for anyone who was looking to watch it, but I will tell you that the movie is not always what it appears to be. I was very impressed with it and was very sad to see it end. I don't know why it didn't get a higher rating, but I hope that it did because it is a great film.

A Great Film!

Author: jc-in-nh from New Hampshire

11 February 2003



I first saw this film in the Sundance Film Festival and I was very impressed. It was very bizarre for the time and I found it very refreshing. It was different from most films I
 This is not a great movie, but it is different. It was made because of the growing popularity of the Beat Generation, and its satirical portrayal of the hippie movement and its devotees. In the early 1960's, the People's Liberation Army was a powerful force in the civil war in China. It had a Hollywood connection. Chou En-lai, the Chinese leader, was an old film actor from the 1930's, who did a number of movies in China. He appeared in a movie about the French Revolution, with a young Jean Seberg as the revolutionary girl, and a young John Wayne as an American general. The movie was a success in China, and was re-titled "The Long March." It was later re-titled "The Great Escape." The People's Liberation Army was impressed by the movie, and sent seven of its soldiers to Hollywood. They spent several months in the movie industry, and came back with the idea of using actual Chinese soldiers in a movie. They contacted the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and got the cooperation of the State Department in arranging a program of tours of Chinese film stars around the United States. The movie was well received by the Hollywood studios. It was distributed by Columbia, the
 This is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in years. Anne Hathaway is best actress of the year and she should get an Oscar for this. Ryan Phillippe should too for his role. This is a great movie for the whole family. It can be a little sappy at times but it's a feel good movie. I hope everyone sees it. If you like the cast and the storyline you will love it.

 I saw this movie as a small child, not knowing what it was about, and it was the most enchanting experience ever. I had never seen a movie quite like it, and I was captivated by the story. It is so strange that the movie did not get more attention, because it is amazing. Nowadays I am a film major and I love this movie even more than the first time I saw it. It is a masterpiece of cinema.

For the first time, I found a movie that was so beautiful, so magical and so funny. I didn't know how to feel about it, it was so different from other films. It is so good, I don't even know how to explain it. I want to share it with my friends, but I don't know how to do it because I don't know where I can see it or what I can do to get it. It is a shame that nobody has seen it, because it is so good. I want to make a petition to get this movie on DVD, so that everyone can see it. I am going to try to get it on DVD, but it will take a lot of time. I am so glad that I have seen it,
 I don't know how old this film is, but it's definitely not a "crappy" movie. It's a fun and well acted movie that I can watch over and over. It is not just a party movie, with the "party" theme being used as a backdrop to the movie. It's a movie that explores what the 60's were really like. The music is right on. The acting is great. And the story line is good. I have to admit, though, I did have to have a couple of drinks to be able to enjoy this movie. I'm a young adult, and I'm sure I will be able to watch this movie over and over again. Also, if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids, this is it. The kids will love the movie, and you'll love the movie too. It's a film that is just for everyone.

Watch it!

I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and "Love is a Ball" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's funny, it's touching, and it's a great film. It's definitely worth watching
 I really enjoyed this movie. The unexpected twists made it a better mystery than some of the others. I thought I had it figured out, but I went back and watched with a friend and found myself uncertain. The acting was superb, between the leads, and the supporting cast was also very good. I didn't even realize this was a comedy until I had watched it twice, but I don't think I would have even noticed that had I not known. It's worth watching, and I would recommend it to anyone.

 This is a very interesting movie about how a man and a woman come from very different backgrounds and how they are forced to work together to survive in a hostile, post-apocalyptic world. There is some violence, so be warned there. However, the violence is very well done, and it shows the consequences of people in a world that has gone to hell. I really enjoyed this movie, and it is quite rare to see an action movie that is set in the future. It's a movie that I would definitely recommend.

 As an American, I think this film is brilliant. I have never seen a more intense film about the Holocaust, and I have seen a lot of Holocaust movies. I am a history teacher and I have taught it since the 12th grade. I have always been fascinated by this subject, and this film is incredible. I love the way the story is told, and the way it is told is so captivating. The audience cannot get enough of this story, and I believe that is because it is so interesting. People are so captivated by the Jews in this film, that they can overlook what a bad film it is. It is a movie about a single man and his family, and it is not a movie about the Jews or the Nazis. I think that the fact that it is about a family is what makes it so interesting to the audience. It is not just a story about the Holocaust. It does not pretend to be a full-fledged documentary of the Holocaust. It is a movie about a family, and if you don't believe that, then go see it.

<br /><br />As far as I know, this film has won various awards, but they have never been rewarded adequately. This film
 I first saw this film in the cinema in the early 80's and have been a fan ever since. I have been to the movie's website many times but have never submitted a comment. I now have a chance to write my first comment on the movie. I feel that the film deserves a lot more attention than the movie has received. The movie is more than just a spoof on the "Highlander" series. It has some very subtle humor, a strong plot and an excellent cast. The plot is simple. A man and a woman who have been separated for a long time meet again and fall in love. The plot is much more than that however. The plot is that of a movie about two people who have been separated for a long time. The two people are played by Bruce Campbell and Linda Hamilton. They are the two main characters in the movie whose relationship is the focus of the movie. The plot is very strong in that there are a lot of aspects to the story. The plot is about the main characters relationship with each other, their past relationship, the relationship with their friends and the relationship with the people around them. The plot is also about whether or not the main characters can have a relationship. The plot is about what
 This is not an easy film to watch, but I'm glad I did. In this film, there is no way to escape from the reality of the situation depicted. The film is not graphic, but it does expose the reality of the inner city ghetto and it does show the reality of the gang situation. The film is not for the faint of heart. It is a look at the reality that many people don't want to see, but it is a reality that we must deal with. This film does not glamorize gang life, but it does deal with the reality of inner city ghetto gangs.

<br /><br />The actors are excellent and I have to congratulate Millard Kaufman for directing this film. He did a good job of directing and making the film interesting. The music is incredible. There is also a beautiful performance by Verna Bloom.

<br /><br />If you are one who likes to watch films with a happy ending, you won't like this film. But if you like to see films that are realistic and tell the truth, then this film is for you.

<br /><br />I give this film 4 out of 5 stars.

 If you are into the '80s, this film is a must see. I actually saw this movie when it first came out in theaters, but I soon forgot about it and did not see it again until I found it on Netflix. This film is a classic and anyone who is a fan of the '80s will love it. One of the best films of the '80s! This film is now on DVD and if you are a fan of the '80s, you must get your hands on it! I highly recommend this film to you.

There are some really funny scenes in this film. One of my favorite scenes is when the part-time clown, Marion, comes in the cafeteria and starts dancing. The scene where he starts dancing is hilarious. Another great scene is when the head of the cheerleading squad, Kate, and her husband are in the bathroom. This scene is really funny and it is one of my favorites. The film has tons of great scenes and it is not just one or two great scenes. This film has many great scenes, which makes it a great film. The film has lots of good scenes and it is a must see.

This film is about an all-girl high

 This movie should have been much better. It was so predictable. A young boy, a spoiled rich kid, who falls in love with a girl who has a passion for music. The two of them meet, fall in love and they become a couple but the rich kid's father wants to marry his daughter to a guy from a good family. The girl's mother agrees and the boy brings Giselle to the house of her parents for an interview. The rich boy is ready to marry Giselle but he is not sure about his father's opinion. He tries to find a solution and all of a sudden, he sees that his girlfriend is about to play on his piano. He goes up to the piano, he sees her face and he falls in love with her. He tries to get away from the rich family but he is caught and is forced to marry her. The next day, he is gone. The rich family is devastated. The girl's parents are happy. They found out that they have a son and they are very happy. They find out that the boy is rich and they want to give him all their money. The girl's mother finds out that the boy was in love with her daughter, she breaks down in tears
 This film is about a young girl, who is called in to testify in a case of her father who has been murdered. She is asked to describe her father's face. She is shown a picture of him and she is asked to tell the jury what she thinks the picture shows. She is unable to do so. She is asked to describe her father's voice. This she is able to do. But when the jury considers the evidence and finds her father guilty, the judge asks her if she has ever seen her father's face. She says yes but she doesn't know how to describe it. He gives her time to think and she says she can see his face as she can see the face of the man she is in love with. The judge says it is not the same and he asks her if she has ever seen her father's face. She says she has not. He says that is impossible since she has never seen her father's face. She is then sentenced to death.

This film is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It is the story of a young girl, who is not able to tell the truth, because she is afraid of the consequences of doing so. She is unable to tell what
 This is a great movie about a little boy that can not grow up. He is a little boy who is so smart and so funny that he almost feels he has a real life. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are great in this movie. The movie is hard to understand at first, but it moves on when you get into it. It is a great movie to watch. I think that it should be a Oscar contender. If you are going to see a movie, see this one.

A little boy that's so smart he can't grow up

Author: Neil Murphy (murryneil@hotmail.com) from United States

6 August 2006



This film was so great. It is the story of a little boy named Andrew who is so smart that he doesn't know why he can't grow up. He is always happy and he has a very good family. He is so smart that he doesn't know how to tell his friends that he doesn't know why he can't grow up. At the end of the film, he discovers that if he goes to his
 I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for a good action/adventure movie, and now I'm a huge fan of this movie. I caught a sneak peek of the film at a theater in Dallas this last week, and I was hooked from the moment the thing started rolling. The movie is 3 hours long, and I think it's going to be released on DVD in a couple of weeks, so if you have a chance, don't hesitate to check it out. I'm sure the 3 hours is going to go quickly, and the more you watch, the more you'll enjoy it. I'm especially looking forward to the DVD, so I can watch it over and over again.

Also, I love the way they castned the roles. I've read that the movie is pretty much a "character study" of the 7 main characters. And the more I've seen of the movie, the more I'm digging the characters. This movie is really the first of it's kind, and I'm hoping it'll be around for a long time.

About the only thing I don't like is the way they ended the movie. The movie ends in a very abrupt way. But, I guess it's
 "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" is a very good film. I've never seen anything quite like it. It's a fantasy. Sherlock is a character that can be interpreted by the audience in many ways. This film sticks with a basic interpretation of the character. He's a loner, a man of mystery, a genius and a man who is completely dedicated to his work. He's also a man of honor, a man of insatiable curiosity and a man who really doesn't care about anyone but himself. He is a creature of nature, a creature of the mind, a creature of the imagination. He's a man who sees things that are not there. He is also a man who sees things that are very much there. He is a man who must constantly look for the truth. What he sees in his mind is a reflection of what he sees in the world around him. When the world around him changes he must change his perception of the world around him. He must be ever vigilant, ever watchful and ever creative to keep up with the new world around him. Holmes is a man who has a very limited number of emotions. He is a man who has no real feelings. He is a man who has
 A wonderful movie about a young man, raised in the "free" West, who returns East and his family and friends, who have abandoned him, are all totally different from what he was raised to believe is "normal." Worth seeing, even if the subtitles are a little hard to read.

I really enjoyed this film. I was born in Russia and left when I was 8. I know what it's like to be a minority and to be told that you're not "normal" when you don't conform. I was also raised in a very strict home, and I'm sure that that's the reason I like this film so much. I felt so much empathy for the kid. I never had a father figure in my life and I know what it's like to not fit in. I know what it's like to not be able to tell your parents the truth. I know what it's like to feel like your life is over. I know what it's like to feel like you're in a prison. So, I relate to this kid. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that I didn't know the rules of the game
 There is no doubt that this is one of the most original and intelligent films of all time. The story line is simple and compelling. The characters are believable and the acting is superb. The film is set in a rundown bar in the middle of a desert. The bar, the characters, and the people are real. The story line is simple, but challenging. If someone had told you about a 30 year old woman who was having a drink with a stranger and a 30 year old man who was having a drink with the same stranger, you would have questioned their sanity. But when you see this movie, you believe that it could happen.<br /><br />The characters are all unique. They have problems and issues that are relatable and believable. They are not "stereotypical" characters. They are not always pleasant and always polite. They have their own issues and behaviors that are believable and interesting. The actors do an excellent job of making the characters real. The story line is compelling and unpredictable. The characters are all set in a small, unassuming bar in the middle of a desert. The bar is not glamorous and the people are not glamorous. But the characters are real and the story line is raw and compelling.
 It's a typical movie, I know that. But the music and the cast are just fantastic. I have seen it many times, but I always watch it with my eyes closed as I don't want to ruin the "feel". And it's a feel I never get tired of. I can watch it with eyes shut, but I always watch it with eyes open. It's that good. I have seen some reviews complaining about the very slow pace and the too much talk. I find it quite the opposite. It's the slow pace that makes you keep watching. Just like all good things, this movie has it's way of making you want to see it again.

I remember seeing the movie years ago in a sports bar in Sweden and I had a friend who was really drunk. As he was asleep, I took my chance to put in the DVD and to close my eyes. I just wanted to see the movie, but I didn't want to watch the movie. I was tired of the movie and just wanted to see the movie. The music and the cast was just too good and it made me almost cry. I was listening to the music and the cast and then suddenly I was in the movie. I have never
 The first sentence of the Wikipedia article on "Connection" has the following sentence: "It was the most expensive TV show ever made in the United States at the time, costing over a billion dollars."<br /><br />I was expecting something along the lines of "It was a great show that was never quite able to live up to its high standards."<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. I was in the minority, I think, in liking the show. But I was also one of the few who thought the series finale was a bit of a letdown. I think I even said as much in a comment on the Wikipedia article.<br /><br />I thought the series finale was not terribly well executed, but it did a great job of explaining the series' complicated mythology. I thought the resolution was not worth the price tag, but I still kept watching. <br /><br />The series finale does a better job of tying up the many loose ends than the last few episodes of the series did. But the series finale is not even close to the best thing about the show. That honor goes to the pilot, which is a simply brilliant piece of television. That is not to say the series
 Hanging out with some friends on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I decided to watch this movie. I can't say I was disappointed. It was a dark comedy that was very unique in the way it was filmed. The acting was actually pretty good. The movie was funny, but not so much that it couldn't be taken seriously. At the end of the movie, I was left with a feeling of sadness. It was as if I had just seen my friends leave me. A very good movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10.

 I had the pleasure of seeing this the other day and its one of those movies you just don't forget. Its a great family film that has a little bit for everyone. I loved it and so did my whole family. I highly recommend it. Its a great date movie, a great family movie, a great date movie with the kids, and a great date movie with just about anyone. I love movies that teach you something and this one does. It is a classic that should be added to your DVD collection.

 I own this film on DVD, and I've watched it many times. I love the concept, the actors, the "feel" of the movie. It's a timeless, sometimes silly, look at the theatre. The only thing I don't love is the opening scene, which was over the top, and unnecessary, to the storyline. The rest of the film is wonderful. I love the music, the acting, everything. I love the "hitch-hikers," and I love the "creature." I love the relationships built up in the film, and I love the "love." It's wonderful, and I'd love to see it again. Thanks to the actors, and the director, and the writer and the crew, for a wonderful film.

I saw this movie in the beginning of the 80's. I think the "creature" was actually a demon. When it started to attack people, I just about jumped out of my skin. I was scared, but when I saw it was just a guy in a suit, I was so relieved. After that I was hooked. I loved the music from the play. It was haunting, but "
 This is a good film. I like the way they portrayed the extreme racism that the people of that time had against the African American people. It was just real. This is a good movie for everyone to see and I think that anyone would enjoy it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes good movies. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

 One of the best anti-war stories ever to be made, "Heaven Knows Mr. Allison" is a tale of a young man's experiences in the military during the Korean War, told by an old man. The story is a moving and dramatic account of man's inhumanity to man, and in using a camera that can capture the viewer's imagination, it's an effective way to illustrate a subject that is, unfortunately, true. The acting is excellent, and the photography is superb, especially the scenes that depict the destruction of the Korean villages and the war in general. The film is more like a novel than a movie, and if you're downhearted about the state of the world today you will leave the theater feeling much better.

The only movie I've ever seen that's so intense that I couldn't watch it with the sound turned up. I didn't want to give it up because it was so good, but I couldn't stand it. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a perfect film, and I give it 10/10.

 I have to admit I was disappointed when I heard about the movie. I wasn't expecting another "The Passion of the Christ". I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting a great tale of the Crusades, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the typical Hollywoodized version of the Crusades, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting lots of gore and blood and battle scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the movie to be a rehash of the "Passion of the Christ", but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting lots of "artsy" shots of Medieval Europe, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the movie to be a "Christian" propaganda piece, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a movie that would stir up controversy, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting to hate this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.

 I saw No Country for Old Men once before and loved it. I was a bit surprised that I didn't love it as much this time around. When I saw it the first time, I was also a bit surprised that I didn't love it as much this time around. I just don't think that I'm a fan of Cormac McCarthy's writing or his novels. I like the movie. I really did. I thought it was well done. I just don't think that it was that great. I'm not sure how it compares to other movies, but I just don't think that it compares to the rest of the movies that I've seen. It was still enjoyable and I thought that the performances were top notch. It just didn't blow me away. The movie was still good though. I think that it was a good film. It just wasn't a great film for me.

One thing that I really liked about the movie was that it kept me guessing. It was a good movie. I just didn't think that it was that great. I'm not sure why. Maybe because I don't like Cormac McCarthy's novels. I'm not sure. I guess that the movie just wasn't as good
 This is one of the best movies ever. As a kid I would always watch it, but I don't remember any of the actors or where it was filmed. I have looked for this movie for years, but I have never found it. I'm so glad I found this website. I'm going to watch it again tonight. I can't wait!

Also, I'm going to watch the movie again. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I lived it. I loved it. The part about the tree was amazing. I love that part. I'm going to make a part about that in my book.

I can't believe it's not on this website. Where is it?

I was just reading on the movie page and I saw that it was made in the 50s. When I was little, I remember watching this movie every night. I can't wait to find it again.

The part with the tree made me cry. My mom even cried. I still think about the tree. I will never forget that day. It's my favorite day ever. It was the best day of my life.

I especially loved the part where the kid was in
 I'm a huge fan of the original "Goonies" and I loved the sequel so much. I was worried going in that this would be terrible, but it was great! I didn't get the see the original (I was 7 at the time) so I can't compare it to the original, but I enjoyed it. It had many of the same elements that the first had, but I think it was better. The animation seemed more advanced. I was worried that the characters wouldn't seem as "real" as they did in the first, but they looked great! The characters were all likable (even the kids). It was a light-hearted plot and was really funny. It was just great. I wouldn't say it was better than the original, but I think that it was still great. The plot was good and believable, and the characters were great. It is definitely a movie that teenagers and adults can enjoy. I think that the original was better, but this was still a great sequel. I think that I would have preferred the original over this, but still, this was great. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a funny movie.

 I don't know if I am the only one who has noticed, but this game is good. The graphics are awesome and the action is really good. This game is not just for the kids, it appeals to adults as well, but that's what the game designers intended. It's not just for kids. I believe that this game is the best of the best of the best.

I think the game is really really really really good and I like it very much. The only thing I don't like is that at the end of the game you have to much time to get to the end of the game. This can be a problem if you play the game alone. I know that there is a cheat which changes the time to zero seconds, but I don't know if it works. If you have any tips on the time problem, let me know. I love this game very much. I have played it with my brother.

 I absolutely love this film. I loved it when I first saw it in the theaters, and I remember watching it again a few years ago to see if I would like it as much as I had before. Surprisingly, I did. Some of the lines in this film are so brilliant that they have stuck with me and I have quoted them over the years. "Look, I've got no room for a conscience. I'm a doctor, and I'm here to help. You're going to die, and if I can save you I will." This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and it will be one of my favorite films of all time. I urge everyone to watch this film.

**SPOILERS**<br /><br />I loved the way the movie ends. The ending is so perfect. When the doctor pulls the plug and gives the woman the injection, I always cry. I always cry when the woman wakes up and sees the doctor and her husband. This is the type of ending that will make you want to watch the film over and over again. The ending is the perfect way to end this film, and it makes you think about the woman and how she must have felt to
 This is a very well made psychological thriller about a man who falls for a girl and then finds out she is a conwoman.<br /><br />The plot is really well constructed and the acting is believable. There is a good twist at the end. I thought it had been a very clever plot. The dialogue was very well done. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good terror story.<br /><br />The DVD is the first Australian DVD I have ever seen. It was very good. I will be watching the other two.

5.0 out of 5 stars Brilliant! Format: DVD This is a brilliant film, i have watched it more than a dozen times and it never gets old. The story keeps you gripped at all times. The acting is top notch and the plot is absolutely brilliant! I have been telling everyone i know about this film. I watch this film every time i go to bed and i find it really helps me sleep! its a must have for any fan of thrillers!

 This is just a phenomenal movie that I recommend to anyone. I could not believe how much I loved it and how much I lost myself in the story. I think it is the best movie I have ever seen. It made me cry and it really should not have been that good of a movie, but it is an amazing story. This is a movie I will cherish forever.

Walking Tall (2004) Walking Tall (2004) 1 February 2006 - 1 out of 1 users found this review helpful. Walking Tall is about a man who is living a lie. He is a man that all the people in his life know about but he doesn't. He is not a man you want to mess with. He is called "The Walking Tall". He only goes after people that have committed crimes. He is very strong and he is a man that will not go down easy. He is the best of the best. He is a killer that has been at this for a while and he has killed many people. He is the best of the best.

 I had never heard of this film before I saw it on TV. I am always looking for material to watch, and I was intrigued because of the title. I had never heard of this director's previous work, but I knew he had made a few other films, mostly the kind with a lot of blood in them. I had seen the book years before, but it didn't provide a lot of information about the film, so I was hoping to find out more.<br /><br />Well, I was not disappointed. The film is well acted, beautifully filmed, and very well paced. The story is very dark and has a lot of violence and bloodshed, but it is not gory, and it's not over the top. The film is about a family who is about to be slaughtered. The mother is trying to get her children to safety, but the father is having trouble because he is paralyzed. It is the third act, when it really gets good.<br /><br />I like this film because it is not a typical Hollywood film. It doesn't try to be a "good" film. It isn't just a film about the human spirit. It is about the human spirit when it is pushed to the
 I watched this film the other day and I was truly impressed. I am a huge fan of the original movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this adaption is. The plot is the same except for one major difference which I won't spoil. The actors are all very good. The only one I felt was a bit over the top was Sissy Spacek as the mother, but she's good and so is all the rest. The suspense and tension builds throughout the movie and I was thoroughly entertained. This is a must see for fans of the original movie. I'm going to have to get the new DVD when it comes out.

 I got to see this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, and I was totally blown away. It was an amazing movie, and it makes Takeshi Kaneshiro's amazing performance more amazing. It's a film that's very hard to make, but this movie makes you feel like you're there, and it's amazing. The whole story is about a young man who has a crush on a girl, and he wants to get to know her better. He does this the best way he can, which is to look at her in a certain way. He's doing this because he doesn't want to get hurt. He's doing this because he has his heart set on her. He's doing this because he wants to know her better. It's a very good film, and it's one that I highly recommend to everyone.

A young man looking for the perfect girl

Author: ronny_d
 I remember seeing this on HBO or Showtime in the early 90's. I don't think I've seen it since, but I know I own a VHS copy of it. I don't even know if I can find it. I know I watched it in the bedroom of a friend's house, and I remember being VERY impressed. I was only 13 at the time, and I have no recollection of the plot, but I remember thinking that I had never seen a movie as good as this before. This one is about a man who is a killer, but he is not told that he is a killer. He is able to see things, and in the end, he sees the man who is trying to kill him, but he can't stop him. I don't think the score is the best that I've ever heard, but I can't really complain. It's got an interesting plot, and a great, original soundtrack. I think it's worth a watch.<br /><br />I wonder if I can find it on DVD, or if I can find it on YouTube.

 This film is amazing. I saw it years ago, but I just recently rediscovered it and I can't find it anywhere to rent. It's a film that you could watch over and over and still find new depth in its story line. The acting is superb and the characters are so lifelike you feel like you know them. The story is so real and you find yourself saying, "That could happen" even though it is fiction. The scene where the girls are at the mall is spot on. It's like my own experience at the mall, which is a scary thing to admit. The only thing that could make this film better is if it was a little longer. I would love to see a sequel to this movie. I think it would be even more amazing.

 I have to admit I was extremely skeptical about this movie. Real life has become so unrealistic and over the top that I was afraid it would be the same with this movie. However, I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. <br /><br />I like the direction this film took, in the fact that it is not just about the story of a person who becomes a hero, but it is also about the people who were there. It is a story that is not just about a person, but a story that is about the people around them. It is also a story about the people who see them. As a fan of the show 24 I was happy to see that the story was not only about a person and how they were able to do what they did. It was also about the people around them and the people who helped them.<br /><br />This is a very good movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch a good story.

Suspenseful, Entertaining, And Emotional

Author: rory-the-dude from United
 The film is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. The only reason I picked it up was because of the cover art, which is pretty neat. The film itself is a good, if not a bit predictable, movie. If you can get past the odd title and the fact that the movie is based on a Crichton novel, then you will be able to enjoy this movie. The film's main focus is on the nanobot that is inserted into the body of the main character, John Preston (played by Matt Damon). The nanobots are used to fix the damage that was done to John's body during his accident. These nanobots, however, were never meant to be used in the manner that they were. They were designed to control the human body and change its functioning. When the nanobots are put into the body of John, they are not able to control his mind or his actions. Instead, they take control of his body. The nanobots start to manipulate the body of John in ways that he never imagined. They begin to change his body and mind. As time goes by, the nanobots are forced to take over the body of John entirely. John
 This is one of the most exciting films I have ever seen. It's about a group of kids and teenagers who have to rescue some animals from the local slaughterhouse. They have to find out where the animals are going and what they are being taken to. If they don't find out in time, they could go to the slaughterhouse themselves. The animals are in a lot of danger. They are also trying to find out who is behind this entire operation. The whole movie is very suspenseful, as well as a little scary at times, because these animals are in danger. A lot of suspense and adventure, and a few laughs thrown in. If you like suspense, you'll love this movie. I recommend it for ages 10 and up. I give this movie a 10/10.

* I received this film from the distributor for the purpose of this review*

 A wonderfully amusing adaptation of the classic tale of a man who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for a brief lifespan. I loved the sheer hilarity of the film.<br /><br />The humour of the film is derived from the fact that the most ungodly things are done, and that to a large extent, the best of intentions are misguided. Yet, the worst of intentions are helped along by the best of intentions. It's a great film.

5.0 out of 5 stars A Good Old Man of Distinction Format: DVD This is a very good film with a depth and maturity that should be applauded.<br /><br />The acting is excellent with great performances from all around. I particularly liked the way the character of Jeremy played by Richard E. Grant was written and the way he was portrayed. I also liked the way the character of Percy played by James McAvoy was written and his character was portrayed by him.<br /><br />The cinematography is very good and the soundtrack is excellent.<br /><br />I also liked the way the film was shot and the way it was edited.<br /><br />I also liked the way the film was written and directed.<
 I got this DVD for Christmas and I have to say, it's stunning. The color and clarity of the film are excellent. It just looks fantastic. And the story itself is also very intriguing. It's a very sad story. It's about a little boy with a heart condition who is put into an orphanage. The movie is very well done and the acting is excellent. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good film.<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10

I had the chance to see this movie at the cinema, and it is definetely one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story is very sad, but it makes you think a lot, since it is not a fairy tale. I really enjoyed it, and I think it is one of the best movies that can be shown to children.

 Never have I seen such a great coming of age story with such a great cast. I've had this on VHS for a couple of years, but I finally got around to watching it. I was hooked after the first few minutes, and it had me laughing almost non-stop.<br /><br />The acting is flawless. The long-haired, long-faced kid who plays the lead is wonderful, and I'd love to know more about him, but I can't find anything about him. I think he's only about 17 years old, but I'm not sure. The only other acting I noted was from the elderly man, who seemed to be very good in the role. He's probably about 70 years old.<br /><br />The story itself is about a young boy who is in a black-and-white world. His dog is the only color he sees, and it's the only thing that talks to him, but that doesn't keep him from living in the real world. He's a loner, for the most part, and is also a dreamer and an artist. He sees the world awfully differently than the people around him.<br /><br />This is one of those movies
 I am a huge fan of this show and was very excited to see the series on DVD. The quality of the DVD is excellent with all of the episodes intact, the episode commentaries are very informative and interesting, and the extras are plentiful. The only disappointment was the lack of deleted scenes, which were present on the DVD of the second season. The show is definitely worth watching. I will certainly be buying seasons 3 and 4 as soon as they are available, and I can't wait to see what happens with the characters in the future.

Sept. 17 2004 By Greg - Published on Amazon.com Format: DVD The story of the "Outlander" is a tale of two brothers who were separated at birth and grew up in different parts of the world. The younger brother was raised in France and was named "Marc Lacombe" while his older brother was raised in Scotland and was named "Jamie Fraser". The two brothers meet in 18th century Scotland and are separated in the Highlands. The younger brother Marc grows up to be a soldier and travels to France
 "The House on the Edge of the Park" is an effective British film that works on a number of levels. The story is a familiar one - an innocent young girl (Jenny Agutter) is accused of murder after a man is found dead in a park and Jenny has a letter signed by the killer (David Huggins) in her possession. The film is also a kind of coming-of-age story for Jenny - she gets to see the world in a very different way than her parents have, and she learns something about herself and the world.<br /><br />The film is also a mystery story. It's interesting that Agutter didn't get a part in the film until the first day of shooting, and I think that's a credit to her performance. It's an interesting character study - Jenny is a very likeable character and it's easy to see why she's so popular with her friends.<br /><br />The film also benefits from some fine directing by Ridley Scott (his first as a director). He does a good job of keeping the film moving and he's been very successful in transferring the setting to the screen. The film also benefits from some fine cinematography by John Alcott (who
 To make a story short, this is a film that is both fascinating and moving. The characters are fascinating. A small, but very distinct and important piece of our history. I think it's even more fascinating because there's no real ending. And, at least in the historical part of it, that's what we need.

I love the movie because it doesn't just tell the story of Maxwell Perkins, Thomas Wolfe and Ernest Hemingway, but it shows the story of the people around them. And, unlike many movies that are about an individual, this movie shows the little bit of the people around them, and it's very moving.

It's a movie that begs to be watched in your own time frame, so that you can really experience the time and place.

If you're a fan of literature and the literary movements of the 1920's, I think you'll love this movie. If you're not, I think you'll still enjoy it. It's a very good story, and I think it will draw you in. I can't recommend it enough.

 I enjoyed the film, it was fun to watch. I haven't seen too much of the work of director and actor, but I've heard they're quite good. The design of the vampires wasn't too out there, but I can't say I've seen their work before. They weren't too scary, but they were still a little bit gruesome for my taste. The plot was good, but I found it a bit hard to follow at times. The acting was good, and I enjoyed the actors' characters, especially the female lead. The cinematography was good, it was a good eye-candy for my eyes. The soundtrack was not too bad, it fit the movie well. Overall I enjoyed the film, and I think I'll check out the director's other work.

The film features a horror influenced by the series of books written by the same name, by Anne Rice. The film revolves around a vampire named Erik, who was turned into a vampire 200 years ago, who is looking for a cure to his curse. He's also looking for his maker, who turned him into a vampire, and he's trying to find a way to get him back. The film follows him,
 I just watched this movie for the first time, and I like it. It has some flaws (such as the way it takes place) and some odd aspects (such as the hero's parents being killed) but it has a lot of charm. I also like the hero. He's very likable, and I like his prejudice against the new generation, as well as his determination to do something about the situation. There are a lot of things I like about it. I'm curious to see what the author's intentions were, and whether or not they were carried out.

The story is interesting and the characters have a lot of depth. I like the music and the way it is used in the movie. The movie could be a little more emotional, but there's something about it that's so charming and fun. I like it.

 I saw this movie in 2005, and thought it was a great film. It is based on true events in the late 50's, the film follows one of the most powerful men in history, who, after being arrested for the murder of his wife, was eventually acquitted in a controversial trial, although he was found guilty of killing his first wife. The movie stars Kevin Bacon as the powerful, volatile, and very charismatic man, who is set against the charismatic and beautiful but not very powerful woman (Charlize Theron), who is engaged to be married to a very powerful man, but is not sure if she should marry him or not. The story unfolds in a very dramatic way, as the two are drawn together and fall in love, and a series of events ensue that could have a devastating effect on their future, and their relationship with each other.<br /><br />The acting in this film is really good, and the cinematography is wonderful. The movie was really well-made, and it was interesting to see that the director, Tony Goldwyn, also played in the film as the strong and powerful man, who gets the girl, and also as the man who was involved in the scandal and was eventually acquitted.<br
 It's a shame that this film got such a bad reputation for being "poorly shot." Even though the film is in black and white, it has excellent lighting and nice camerawork. I just wish that more people would see it.

<br /><br />The film is a very low-key, almost classical, psycho-thriller. It focuses on the relationships between two men, a married one and a young one. The older man is very protective of the younger one, who is unstable and not very bright. In the end, the older man's patience is exhausted and he does something that is totally unexpected.

<br /><br />Although the film is a little slow at times, the end result is worth it. This is one of the best films I've seen this year.<br /><br />

 This is a very interesting film, beautifully shot and well acted. The story is slow moving, but there is no real hurry. The film is about the relationship between a young British soldier, who has been sent to India to fight for the British, and a young Indian man who joins him in his regiment. Both are young and inexperienced, both are just about to go to war, and both feel like outcasts. The conflict between their cultures is central to the film, and the film is about the impact of war on young men from different countries. This is a film which explores these conflicts, not in an overt way, but through the characters themselves. The film is beautifully shot, and I would recommend it to anyone.

 Wow, this is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. The acting is amazing, the story is well thought out and just the right amount of gore.<br /><br />The story is about a guy named Sam, who goes to a remote cabin in the woods to try and get his life back together. One night he gets a package from his old college friend Sam. The night he gets it he goes into the woods to try and find a place to stay. He goes through the woods and discovers a cabin. He is welcomed in by a perverted old man and his daughter. He makes a friend with the girl and they both have a good time.<br /><br />The next morning he gets a call from his ex-wife, and she tells him he is going to be a father. He is shocked and delighted. That night he has a nightmare, where he is being stalked by his ex-wife and his ex-girlfriend. He has to go on this strange journey. He must find out what is going on and what is in his package.<br /><br />This movie is creepy and scary, and very well done. If you like true horror and don't mind a little gore
 This movie is absolutely brilliant. The characters are so wonderfully fleshed out and the acting is just perfect. The whole storyline is completely believable and I also loved the music. I was absolutely fascinated with the tale and how much it was based on reality. The movie is absolutely unpredictable and has a very original storyline. I was so sad when the movie was over and I have to say I have seen a lot of movies in my life time but this is one of the best. It is difficult to see a movie that can really touch you on such a personal level. The movie is highly recommended to anyone who loves a movie with a heart and a story to tell. I loved the movie so much that I went and bought the soundtrack and the movie is now my favourite movie ever. My only complaint is that the movie is not available on DVD.

 This was a great movie. I saw it in the theatre because I wanted to be surprised and I was! The movie is more challenging than you think it's going to be. There are so many twists and turns and you can't expect the ending to be what you think it's going to be. I didn't get it at first, but a couple of scenes later it all came together for me. Matthew Stagg was perfect for the role. I'm a little disappointed that this movie didn't do well at the box office. I think it deserved more. I don't know what it is about this movie, but I can't stop thinking about it.

 I have seen a lot of movies on this site, and i have to say this is the greatest movie i have ever seen. I can't believe how much i love it. It has such a great storyline, and when watching it you feel like you are in the movie. Its a very good movie, and the story is really good and really funny. It has a lot of funny scenes, and the singing is great. It is a very special movie, not like any other. I personally think that its the best movie i have ever seen, i think everyone else should see it too. I love this movie so much, and its my favorite movie ever.

Well, that's all i have to say. I hope you liked this review, and that it helped you to decide whether or not you should see it. If you do see it, you will definitely love it, and you will want to watch it again
 I've been a big fan of director Jonathan Demme since I saw him in the hilarious but yet touching "Married to the Mob" in 1991.<br /><br />I saw "Something to Talk About" on HBO and was expecting an average, merely OK film from Demme, but I got so much more. It was funny, touching, and very moving. Bridget Fonda and Meryl Streep are amazing in this film, and I think that this is one of the best performances of Fonda's career.<br /><br />Streep's performance, on the other hand, is the most impressive thing about the film. She plays her character so well, and you don't see her acting like Meryl Streep, but like someone you know, someone who's in a very difficult situation, someone who has been through a lot and is trying to get through it all. It's a very good performance, and Streep has never been quite so good.<br /><br />"Something to Talk About" is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Stunning and moving
 'The Great Santini' is a powerful war drama. It's a tragic story of two brothers, one a Marine and the other a teacher. The Marine returns from the Vietnam War a broken man, and his family struggles to cope with his mental and physical disabilities. Told through flashbacks, the film is an insightful and thought provoking study of war, family, and the burden of caring for a family member with a disability.<br /><br />The film begins with a flashback to a scene in the war. Two Marines are in a helicopter, on their way back from a mission, when one of the men is killed by a Vietcong sniper, who manages to shoot off the Marine's arm. Although it's a shocking scene the viewer is told how the Marine was killed, and that it was the result of a war that was morally wrong, and the only way to end the war. The film then shifts to a scene at the Great Santini house. The Marine's younger brother, Jimmy, is a teacher living at home who is dealing with his brother's disability, as well as the recent death of his wife. He's also resentful of his brother and wants him to be a part of his life. His wife,
 I don't find it very often that I sit down and watch a movie and can't stop. However, this is one of those movies. The acting was terrific. The story was simple but had a lot of suspense. I found myself wondering what would happen next. I had to watch this movie several times because I didn't want it to end. The ending was a little bit to the happy side, but I don't think this is the way the author wanted it to end. I do recommend this movie to anyone who loves mystery and suspense. I think it is a must see for anyone who loves a good story.

 The best part of this movie is how it is a companion piece to the original Grinch. It really is a Christmas Carol with the Grinch as the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge. That being said, the Grinch is no Scrooge, rather he is a Grinch.<br /><br />The movie is beautifully animated and is great for the younger crowd. I think the best part is the Grinch's transformation from selfish to generous. The only problem is that it is the same story told from a different point of view so it is a little confusing. But, if you have seen the original Grinch and you don't have this movie, you are missing out.

<br /><br />I don't understand why they made this movie. It kind of takes away from the charm of the original
 When I saw the film years ago, I was surprised that a project of this type was even made. Here we have a film that will appeal to those who seek to understand the life of those who have served in the armed forces and those who have been wounded and the families of those who have passed away. Here we have a film that will be a tribute to the men and women who have served in the armed forces and those who have served their country and to the families who have had to endure the loss of a loved one. <br /><br />It is the story of a young man named Michael Donahue, who is the son of a Vietnam veteran, who is a student at Yale University. Michael is a talented artist who is being wooed by a very attractive young woman. Michael's mother died when he was very young and he has not had a chance to know his father, as his father has always been on a tour of duty. Michael meets a young woman, Susan, at a party and they begin a relationship. The relationship becomes serious and they decide to marry. Michael's father is a career military man and the film details the problems Michael has with his father on the eve of the wedding. His father has
 Everyone knows the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, but not many have heard of the rat-catchers that kept his legend alive. I found this film to be very entertaining and very well done. It's a bit long, but well worth the time spent.

The main character, Hamelin, is a rascal, but that just makes him more entertaining. The German folk tale is dark, but the makers of this film were able to show that the tale was not meant to be a true story of how the Pied Piper came to town. They were able to show how the townspeople and the rats were able to co-exist.

A good cast includes Tootsie Thom as the rat-catcher and Ernst Deutsch as Hamelin.

If you enjoy historical films, you can't go wrong with Pied Piper of Hamelin.

Highly recommended!

I give it a 9.5/10

 I'm in the minority here. Some of you will hate it and some of you will love it. Me, I like it. It's a very original zombie film that is pretty funny and has some good special effects. I love "Dawn of the Dead" but this is better in my opinion. I loved it. I'm not saying that it's better than "Dawn of the Dead" but it has everything that I like in zombie films. It has the characters, humor and a few surprises. I can't say much about it without giving things away. So for now I'll just say that I liked it. I hope that you will. I give it a 9/10.

 This film is a great story of a young boy who learns to accept himself and his sexuality. I found the film to be sweet and charming, it seems to be a family film. I am a straight teenage boy who has never been interested in the gay lifestyle. I found this film to be a great way for me to better understand what life is like for a gay teenager, to see the "outside world" through someone else's eyes. I would recommend this film to any teenager who is struggling with their sexuality or has no idea where they stand on the issue of homosexuality. If a teenager is struggling with their sexuality, this film will help them to better understand what they're feeling, and how they feel. I give this film a 9 out of 10.

I have never seen a film quite like this one before. I have seen gay films before, but this was my first film directed by a gay man. I was really impressed by the fact that the director had the courage to tell this story of a young gay boy in a way that was honest, uplifting, and beautiful. The film is about a 15 year old boy named David (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is in the process of coming out to his family
 I am not a big fan of romantic comedies, but I am a big fan of this movie. The script was absolutely brilliant. The dialogue was so funny, especially the things that the main character, Luke, says. He's a character who is so different from the other characters in the movie. He's the guy that you can't help but love. His personality is so vibrant. The actors were all wonderful. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Luke and Gina, his love interest. I think that the only complaint I would have about this movie is that it was a little too short. I would have liked to see a little bit more of Luke and Gina. I also would have liked to see a little bit more of the other characters in the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to any romantic comedy fan.

***SPOILER***

As a cliffhanger, I loved that Luke would have finally gone out with Gina, but after a few minutes, the scene changes. I was so surprised by this. I was really surprised that he went dancing with another girl, but the drama was just as interesting. I was really upset for Luke at the end, after he and Gina had planned to go out,
 This is a very good movie. It starts off with a young woman who has just moved to a new city in Colorado. She is looking for a job. She goes to a local cafe where she meets the owner, who is a very friendly man. He invites her to his house for a cup of coffee and a little chat. She is very intrigued by the owner and decides to stay for the summer, which turns out to be a happy decision.<br /><br />The owner owns a small movie theater and he has a crew of people who work for him. This movie follows the working life of these people in the theater. There are the stage hands, the projectionist, the projectionist's assistant, the concession stand person, the cashier and the manager. The film is a very interesting look at the world of small-time movie theaters. It shows how people work together in these places. It shows the different personalities that work at these theaters. There are some funny moments in the movie. The camera work is very good and the cast is excellent. The movie is a very good look at how people work together in these places and how movies are made. I really enjoyed the movie.

 I saw this on the big screen in a theater and the film came together very nicely. It was well acted, had a good script, and was a very well done movie. The best part was the music and special effects. The music was used in a very good way. It was uplifting, happy and just made you feel good. I liked the addition of the special effects. They were really cool and the lighting of the castle and the castle itself was really good. Overall the movie was really good. I would see it again. If you want to see a movie that is well done then I would say go see this movie.

 This is the film version of a very good play. On the basis of this film, I've seen the play performed twice in the last week, and enjoyed it even more than the first time. <br /><br />It's very funny, and there's some good chemistry between the two leads, which makes the story more believable.<br /><br />The film is not without its flaws, however.<br /><br />I thought the two women in the opening scene were a bit overdone. And the way they were introduced into the story, I felt as if they were being used merely as props. But these are minor quibbles.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful film, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes dark humor.

I have only seen the film once and it is seriously funny. I don't think I've laughed so hard at a film since the first time I saw "The Life Aquatic". The film has its moments of dark humour but overall it is hilarious
 This movie was a great surprise. It has a good story, and the actors did a good job. The story is about a man named Buster (Jim Belushi) who was in the army and was on tour in Iraq. While he was on tour in Iraq, he found a disabled boy and took him back to the US, and then he is given to his sister, Rita. Rita is very crazy and does not want to care for her brother. Rita's son (Anthony Anderson) comes to see his brother, but Rita kicks him out. The story has some good twists and turns. I thought Beth (Brandy) was great in it. I can't wait to see the sequel!

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was pretty good. The acting was good and the movie was very moving. If you are a fan of the original, this is a must see. I think it is up there with the original
 This is one of the best comedies ever made. I have seen this movie several times and I still laugh at it. Its one of the few movies that I know that you can sit down and watch without thinking about what you are doing. The whole movie is extremely funny. I would recommend this to anyone. <br /><br />I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

 I must say I couldn't help but laugh when the scene in which the guys line up to use the bathroom and one of them asks for the soap. I thought that was a bit of a joke. But, actually it was pretty good. It was almost a little too much like a sitcom, but it's not one that I thought was bad. They made it into a movie and it was good.<br /><br />It's actually pretty funny, but I have to say that I think they left out a lot of stuff. I know there was a lot of stuff that they left out, but I can't recall exactly what it was. I do know that there is no part where the girl who was in the bathroom with them has the guy that sort of rapes her. That was a pretty big part. The part of the guy who was in the bathroom with her, she was in the bathroom with him for so long, and then he decides to rape her, but then she gets away. I know that there is also a scene where one of the guys decides to get in and just starts brutally beating up the guy. I know that there is one part where one of the guys is about to get a blowjob and
 I saw this movie in the movie theater when it came out, and I was very excited to see a sci-fi movie that wasn't all about special effects. I liked the story and the characters, and was glad to see actors I liked in the movie. Seeing that it was based on a novel, I was hoping for a bit more depth to the story. But, it was still enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing the movie again.

It was good to see the characters again, but I felt like the movie really wasn't very exciting. I was relieved to see the battle between the orcs and the men of Gondor, but the movie really didn't have the same impact it did the first time I saw it. I think the movie felt a bit long and drawn-out, and wasn't as emotionally charged as the first one.

 I have never believed in reincarnation, but after watching this movie, I have to change my mind. This movie is sooo good. It is about a boy that has to leave his home because of a bad storm, that is about to hit his town. He has to leave his town, but he has to return. He has to return, because his mom is pregnant with his brother, and the mother is dying. He has to go back, not knowing what is going to happen in his town when he returns. I love this movie because it is so good. I love the actors, and i love the director. I also love the music in it, and every part of the movie is amazing. I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I will never forget this movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

 I saw it on TV when it came out in the early 80s. I never thought that I would like it so much. I had always been a fan of the original, but when I saw the remake, I was hooked. It's the quintessential 80s movie with the right combination of humor and action. I was hooked by the end of the first scene. The only part of the movie I didn't like was the ending (which I realize is a matter of opinion). The acting is terrific and the storyline is a fun romp. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

"You can't beat a good woman, anyway!"

by tjr2

I saw this movie when I was very young, maybe 4 or 5 years old. I remember liking it, but it wasn't until I saw it again in college that I fell in love with it. I watched it every time it came on TV. I've seen it a total of four times, and I never get tired of it. The movie's characters are wonderfully
 I am a feminist and I don't think this is a film that attacks feminism. It's not even against or against the idea of feminism. It's a film that attacks the idea of abusive relationships. I actually liked this film and am not a feminist - I found it to be a very real portrayal of the issues that face women in relationships.<br /><br />It's a realistic film dealing with emotional and physical abuse in a relationship. It could actually happen to any woman and it's an issue that needs to be discussed. The acting was great and I was moved by the scenes with the children when they refer to their dad as "Daddy", but when they refer to him as "Daddy" it's because he's their father. I think it's more about the fact that he's not their real dad and that their mother is still with another man.<br /><br />I think it's an important story that needs to be told and I think it's important that if a woman is going through this period in her life that she knows that she was not alone and that there are other women that have been through the same problems and are able to provide support and advice.

This is a sensitive story that is worthwhile
 This film is a breathtaking piece of genius. I have never seen a film that so perfectly captures the essence of what it is like to be a fighting man in war. The way the film is shot, the way the action is edited, and the general feel of the film is so incredibly accurate that you feel like you are in the middle of the action yourself.<br /><br />The film tells the story of three men as they fight in World War II. They were all young men who had no idea what to expect of the war. Some were scared, some were angry, some were naive, but all three men were willing to give their lives for their country to make sure that the rest of the world was safe. The film is shot in such a way that you feel like you are there with them, taking part in the action. Even when you are not watching it, the sound of the guns firing, the sound of the air planes, and the sound of the explosions make you feel like you are there. It is brilliantly done.<br /><br />The acting is excellent all around. The three main characters are simply amazing. They are so believable and so real that you feel like you are right there with them.
 This is an excellent documentary about the birth of the New Left and the limits of possibility for a movement of political activists in the face of the cold war, with a special focus on the Weatherman faction of the New Left. This documentary, which was co-directed by the documentary filmmaker and former New Left activist, D.A. Pennebaker, provides a very interesting and revealing look at the inner workings of this very secretive, yet incredibly influential, organization. <br /><br />The film opens with a very interesting, yet comical, bit of footage of the Weather Underground's, Bill Ayers, and his willingness to display himself on T.V., even if it meant being a little less than perfect in his answers (i.e., "I am what I am"). This is juxtaposed with footage from Ayers' past, where, as a college professor, he is seen making radical statements about the Vietnam War and the need for radical change. He stands in the classroom, his arms raised above his head, and exclaims that "there is no power in the world that can stop the clock" (a reference to a famous Martin Niemöller quote, that "the innocent can always be executed").
 I saw this film as part of a study hall film club. I was very disappointed. I think it is a very short film. I would have liked to see more fighting and more action. I think the ending was a little too easy. I think that this film would have been better had the ending been more "confrontational." I think the plot was good. I thought the dialogue was very good. I think that the actors were good. I thought the director did a good job. I think that the music was good. I think the cinematography was good. I think that the editing was good. I think that the story was good. I think that the symbolism was good. I think that the special effects were good. I think that the art direction was good. I think that the wardrobe was good. I think that the makeup was good. I think that the lighting was good. I think that the sound was good. I think that the cinematography was good. I think that the music was good.

 WARNING: If you are offended by swearing and/or sexual content, you should not watch this movie. It is not for the faint of heart, and contains a few shocking scenes. The movie is only about an hour, and it is well worth the time. If you are a fan of the movie, "PCU", you'll love this film! It contains a lot of the same characters and themes, but it's even better in my opinion. This is a great movie for all ages, but it is not suitable for children. I highly recommend this movie.

 I saw this film at the New St. Pancras Renaissance Film Festival in London where there was a great turnout of people and the film had its own screening room. It was a great atmosphere. I was impressed with the film and the sound was good. I was also impressed with the film festival which was running in parallel to the film. On the whole it was a fairly impressive showing of films, which is to be expected at a festival. The films were of a high standard and the exposure to what we have here in the UK is much greater than I previously thought. The films were usually good to very good.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed to see that the film had been cut after the screening. The films of the festival were not censored and were shown in their full length and I think that a festival should be about films, not about good and not so good films being cut to suit a small audience. Unfortunately the film was cut and I think the audience was a little bit disappointed with that and I did not get the full feeling of the film. The film is not a very good film and I think that the festival probably lost money on this one. It was a good film, but not a very good
 After seeing this movie, I found myself thinking "that could never happen!" The thought process is typical of a young child. We think we know everything and are right all the time. We are often wrong; however, the audience finds themselves rooting for the little guy and not his big brother. Father and son, father and son, father and son. Once you enter the movie, you are on the side of the little boy and the entire audience and rooting for his survival. In the end, it becomes a battle between the little guy and the big guy and we find ourselves cheering for the little guy to win.

The movie is about a little boy and his father and their adventures in the jungle. The little boy's name is Peter and his father's name is Paul and they are explorers, not the Indiana Jones type, but just good old boy explorers. The main story line starts with these two in the middle of the jungle. They are lost and they are starving. The little boy starts to get sick and then his father helps him by giving him a little bit of meat. The little boy is still very sick, but the father doesn't feel too bad because he has been eating a bit of meat. They are both so
 I was going to rate this movie 6 but decided to dock it a couple of points for being extremely poorly written. Most of the plot points were so lame and clichéd I fell asleep at several points. The main character is extremely unbelievable. He acts like a sex-crazed maniac at times, but then says things like "I'm not sure" and "No, I didn't" at other times. It's a little bit hard to believe that the main character is in his early 20's, considering his "bratty" behavior. The actor playing the main character barely resembles the character he plays at certain points. The dialogue was boring and forced. Overall, this movie sucks. Do not see it.

 Yes, it's silly. Yes, it's stupid. Yes, it's a spoof. Yes, it's a parody of the "Blair Witch Project" and other films. But it's also a lot of fun. And it's nice to know that not only are there a few people out there who are still able to laugh at the silliness of some of the horror/thriller films that Hollywood pumps out every year, there are also a few who are able to go back in time and make their own monster movies. And for that, I give them a B+.

The movie's plot is a little confusing. The film opens with a group of friends, including two girls (one of whom is played by Amanda Tapping), entering a forest in search of "the monster." They have no idea what they're going to find, but they know that they're looking for something that's not human. One of the friends, however, has a camera, and she begins filming the group. The camera is then thrown away and the group is attacked by the "monster." The attack is real, but the camera is fake. The camera was thrown into the river, and the "monster" is really just the
 This is my first review ever and I've been a big fan of your work since I saw "Titanic" when it came out. I just wanted to say that this movie was great and still holds up to this day 12 years later. I think Sondheim's score is one of his best and it's something that I think a lot of people overlook.<br /><br />The movie was also a great homage to the original. I'd seen the first movie in the theater and didn't like it because it was so different from the book. The second time I saw the movie, I loved it. I think the subtle changes in the movie helped keep the tone of the book, but still added new scenes that were completely new.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good musical. I'd also recommend "The Golden Girls" to anyone who wants to see a funny, touching movie.

 If you have the slightest interest in what it is to be a woman, then you will enjoy this film. It is a very good movie and a real eye-opener. The atmosphere of the film is wonderful and the locations are very beautiful, but it is the women that make the film that you will remember. Their stories are very touching, sad, funny and at times even a little bit scary. Definitely worth seeing.

4.0 out of 5 stars A film that does not only show what it is like to be a woman, but also the troubles men have to endure. VINE VOICE Format: DVD I was very surprised to find that this film is actually an adaptation of the novel by the same name. I had no idea that it was based on a novel and I was always told that it was non-fiction. The film is set in a town called Krasnoyarsk in Siberia and it depicts the lives of four women, all of whom have suffered a troubled relationship with their husband. This is an extremely fascinating and visually stunning film, which is brought to life by the scenery of this remote town. The first part of the film shows the women's relationships with their husbands and the second part of
 One of the most underrated films of the 70's in my opinion. I saw this film on a day when I was very bored. I would have never have thought the movie would be so good. The story line is about a young girl who is trying to find herself. She gets involved with a bad crowd and gets involved with drugs and prostitution. She goes to school to get her G.E.D. which is an easy way out of all the problems she has. It is also her way out of her life. She gets involved with an older doctor who is a very nice guy. She goes with him to visit his sick father in the hospital. She is still on drugs but not as bad as she was before. She meets the doctor's nephew who is a nice kid. The movie is very good. The actors do an excellent job. It is a very realistic movie. I would highly recommend this film.

 This movie is awesome. I've seen it twice and I'm going to see it again. I like the characters and the concept of the film. I laughed and cried at the same time. I think it is well-written. The actors did a great job. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is very funny and sad. I will never forget this movie. <br /><br />The movie starts off with a group of people and they are doing some things that are not good. Then a boy comes in and asks where the summer camp is. After a while, they realize that the summer camp is closed. Then, they start to leave. The girl who is in the middle of the group goes back to her house and finds her family dead. Then, a boy comes in. He's hearing the girl's voice. Then, he sees the girl in her house. The boy gets scared and runs away. Then, the girl and the boy are in the same room. Then, all of the sudden, the girl and the boy wake up from a dream. They then wake up and figure that they're at a summer camp. The girl asks the boy if he likes her and he says yes. Then,
 I have been a fan of the series since it first started in the late sixties and have loved it over the years. I bought the first two seasons from one of the first sellers of TV series on DVD. I also own all of the later seasons on DVD and am now working my way through them. The first episode of this new series made me realise that this show was far superior to the later versions. The story was well written and the acting by the entire cast was first class. The plot line was complex and interesting and the characters were interesting and well defined. The quality of the series was superior to the later versions and I am convinced that the original writers and producers were the best. I hope that this series becomes available on DVD in the near future.

I have been a fan of the series since it first started in the late sixties and have loved it over the years. I bought the first two seasons from one of the first sellers of TV series on DVD.
 I had never even heard of this movie until I saw it on a late night show on the Sci-Fi Channel. I was instantly taken with the story, the characters, and the drama. I've never seen a movie quite like it. It's a great mix of drama, suspense, and horror. It's the story of a group of teens who go out to the woods to go camping. They are told that there is a monster in the woods, and that to be safe, they should not go there after dark. But being teenagers and not believing in the supernatural, they go anyway. Turns out, there is a monster in the woods, and it is after them, and now they are trapped in the woods with it. There is one girl who has a good heart, and she is the one who tries to keep the others calm and help them get out of the woods. The monster is a big, frightening looking thing that looks like something out of a Japanese horror movie. The movie is directed by Eli Roth, who also wrote the screenplay. It's a movie that will make you think, and it's a great scare-fest. It's a movie that will make you jump at the end of every scene, and
 I read the book but cannot recall much about the movie. There are several scenes that are from the novel that I can remember, including most of the ending. The movie has a very good cast, though I have not seen anyone in the movie that I would have wanted to see in the book. The actors don't have the same accents as the book, but much as I love the accent of the characters in "The Princess Bride", I can't overlook the fact that some of the actors in the movie would not have been able to pull off the characters. I would read the book before seeing the movie. I think that would be better. I had high expectations the movie would be good, and it was not. But it had me laughing out loud several times, and that's what it's all about.

 A film about a Japanese diplomat who is in Canada to get a visa for his son to come to the States. As he is waiting for the visa, he starts to get to know his neighbours and their problems. It is a touching film about the Japanese in Canada, and the Japanese in Canada have a rough time, especially in the late 1960's. The film has all the elements a good film should have, good acting, good dialogue, good plot and good direction. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially the woman who plays the wife. The setting is Canada, but the film has a universal theme. The film is very well done, and a good film to watch.

Good film I thought it was very touching and quite realistic. I would say it was a great little look at Canada in the 60's and the Canadian people.

 This film was very good. It had a very good plot. It had a great cast. It had good cinematography. It had a good script. It had great music. It had a great director. It had a good cast.

 This movie is pretty much what you expect. A girl is in a coma. When she wakes up she has no memory of her life before the coma. She soon sheds her identity and becomes a total bitch. This movie is pretty much a sick, disturbing and disturbing movie that takes place in one of the worst places ever. It is a pretty messed up movie. I guess it is pretty much the same as all the other freaks, but this is the first one that I have seen. This is a pretty fun, twisted and disturbed movie. There were some pretty gruesome and disturbing scenes. There are some pretty good acting from this movie. The plot is pretty much pretty much the same as all the other movies.

 This is a great classic comedy.The one thing that makes it even more of a classic is that it is done by the legendary Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.The story of this classic is about a couple of brokenhearted men who go to a desert island for the weekend and meet a man who gives them advice.The advice leads them to going to a local bar where they are greeted by a "tender" woman.I recommend this classic comedy to anyone who loves funny comedy.

 I saw this movie in the theater and, quite frankly, I had NO clue what the heck is happening. Somehow, it was very engaging, though I don't think I realized what was going on for several minutes at a time. I am a huge fan of the original "The Elephant Man" (1980) and was glad to see another movie about an interesting subject. The acting was excellent, and I think that the director made a great choice with the casting. I don't know what else to say other than I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie was very well received at Cannes, too, which is usually a good sign.

 This movie is a terrific mix of serious drama and comedy, with a healthy dose of romance thrown in. It's a little slow at first, but it's well worth sticking with it. The acting is excellent all around, from the comedic turns to the more dramatic ones. It's also a great story. I've watched this movie more times than I can count, and I always enjoy it for its wonderful story and subtle humor. It's definitely worth your time.

 This movie has been my favorite film since I was young. I watched it every night after school for years. It is a really good story about a 14 year old boy who gets a chance to be a fireman and save his dad's life. I think it's a good movie for children, but also for adults. I think this movie is really good, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.

Also this will be a good movie for you to watch when your going to sleep or when you are just bored.

Thank you for reading my review, and keep checking back for more reviews.

 I had the good fortune to see this film on the same day as the DVD release. I had been a fan of the comic book series since I was a kid, and the film has everything I was expecting: tons of action, a great cast, and an unexpected ending. The movie is not for everyone. It is violent, gory, and does not shy away from showing the violence of the main characters.<br /><br />The two main characters were exactly how I had imagined them. Logan is a very intelligent and powerful character, but he is very haunted by his past. He is also not a hero, as his actions often seem to be without thought. He is simply doing what needs to be done to survive and protect the people he loves.<br /><br />Deadpool is a psychopath and a killer. He is also funny and highly entertaining. I found myself rooting for him, even though he is the villain. The character of Deadpool is a lot like the Batman character, because he is the only one who is able to see the truth and act on it. Deadpool is a hero in his own way, because he is willing to put his life at risk for the people he loves.<br /><br />
 The 3rd season of the show - which is a bit more interesting in terms of humor. The main characters are now adults, and they are going to college in the US. The show is basically about their adventures in the US, but it's still funny. If you like the show, you should check this one out.

 The title of this movie was misleading. I thought it was going to be a movie that focused on the life of a college student, and that is what I thought it was going to be. It is not.<br /><br />Donna, a college senior, is out and about with her friends, drinking and trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. She has a lot of plans, but she has not yet decided what she wants to do for a career. She wakes up one morning and feels that there is something missing from her life. She has not found a job, has not found a boyfriend, and has not found a place where she wants to live.<br /><br />A friend of Donna's asks her to go on a trip with her to Mexico. Donna agrees, thinking that she may find her answer there. She is not sure what she will find, but she expects to find something. She expects to find love, romance, and maybe even a job. She hopes to find a place where she can stay for a while.<br /><br />She finds where she has been looking. She finds a man. She finds love in Mexico. She finds a job to help her
 This movie is one of the best things I've seen in a long time. I can't say that enough. I'm serious. I've seen it several times, and it's still as great as ever. I have a copy of it and have watched it several times. I'm running out of ways to say how much I love it. I have to say, that I have a soft spot for movies that make you think, and this one does. I may be a little biased, I've seen it at least 10 times, but I think it's an excellent movie. I highly recommend it. 10/10

Opinion of the film: 8/10

I think this film is good because it takes a few moments from the book and changes the story a little bit, but it's still based in a lot of the book. What I like about this film is that it doesn't just show the ugly, horrible parts of the story, but it shows that even though the book shows the ugly, horrible parts of the story, part of the reason it's so interesting is because it shows good, nice parts as
 You can come up with all the theories about who the character is, but the only thing you can be sure of is that the character is not the average movie conman. This movie is a tour de force of filmmaking. The feel of the movie is moody, suspenseful, and yet, there is a light, humorous touch. The movie is all about the internal conflict between the main character and himself. The scenes will have you at the edge of your seat. The movie has a lot of the same visual touches that the director pulled off with "The Dark Knight." I don't know if the director's name is Christopher Nolan or if this is his first movie, but if you liked the first one, you will love this one.

<br /><br />"The Prestige" is a movie that you can talk about for days and days. I loved it.

 This is a great film. It captures the mood of the time and the place, and manages to make a fairly mild film look and sound like a raw, gritty piece of cinema. The acting is good, the story is well told and the music really sets the tone. The only thing that could have made this film better would have been a little more gore or nudity, but all in all, this is a great film that deserves to be seen by everyone.

Just saw it on DVD at Blockbuster over the weekend and it was the best Grindhouse film I've seen yet. Very cool that it's the only film to be given a 15 rating in Australia! One of the few films I'll wait for the DVD release of.

I saw this on the weekend and it was a great movie. It was very intense, very well acted and a great story. There was not a lot of gore in the film but that was a good thing as I'm not a gore fan. The only thing that was a little off with the film was the music, it didn't completely fit.

 This film is a true masterpiece. It is not only a great film, but a great piece of art. I saw it in the theatre and thought it was the best film I had ever seen. I read the book, and I was amazed at how they captured the main characters as they were in the book. I'd see this film every ten years or so, and I always enjoyed it just as much as the first time.<br /><br />This film is the only one I've seen with a male lead who is only 14 and isn't a nerd. I know that many people have told me that this was the first film in which a 14 year old lead character was not a loser. I don't think it was the first, but it was one of the first. I know that many people who have seen this film have told me that it makes them cry, and I also know that many people have told me that it makes them angry with the film-makers who made this film. I don't understand this feeling. I think that this movie is a great piece of art.<br /><br />I think that the film-makers of this film must have been geniuses.

 I'm a big fan of the original, so I was looking forward to seeing this one. I wasn't disappointed, but I don't think the new actors were up to the task of playing the roles of the young, slightly rude, and very funny kids in the original. The new kids, in my opinion, were a bit too much like the kids in the original. I am not trying to sound like a whining old lady, but I did miss some of the original's humor in this new version. I know the new kids had to be different, but I think they could have approached the characters from a different angle. I like to think that the young boys in the original were a little more like the boys in the original. They were a little less mature, but they were still funny. I think that if the new kids had played the young boys in the original, it could have been a hit for both the kids and the adults.

 I must admit that I am not a huge fan of the horror genre....but I am a huge fan of the Saw movie series. I love the way that they are made. They are different from most horror movies because they are almost purely psychological. They are like a horror version of the movie "Primal Fear" (which I love). This movie is another example of a movie that is different from most horror movies. It is like a psychological horror movie. It is not like the Saw movies (which are also psychological). This movie is more like "Primal Fear" (which is the movie that the third Saw movie is a sequel to). Like most movies, this movie has a good and a bad side. The good side is that the movie does make you think in a different way. The bad side is that it is a bit slow and it does not have a very good ending. But, in my opinion, it is a great movie.

 The series is one of the best I've ever seen. I will admit that the series does have its flaws. The acting at times can be a bit stiff. The script can get a bit confusing and the writing can be a bit inconsistent. But, it's an excellent series that captures the viewers attention and keeps you coming back for more. The mystery and suspense are wonderful and the characters are real and well developed. So, if you can look past it's flaws, this is one of the best series on television.<br /><br />The series also provides a lot of great insight into the real history of the times. The series is historical to say the least. It shows the American's trying to get back on their feet after the war and how they were slowly building and taking more control of their country. The series also shows a lot of the behind the scenes dealings of the politicians and how they were willing to do almost anything to get re-elected. It shows how much the American people were willing to sacrifice. It also shows how the politicians were willing to use the American's best interests to get re-elected. It's an excellent series that shows the true history of the times.<br /><br />If you want
 The screenplay is a masterpiece. The movie is about a woman & her son. The son is dying of cancer. The mother is dying of cancer. The mother finds out that her son is right next door to her. She goes & visits her son. The son is in the hospital. The mother finds out that they are going to pull the plug on her son. The mother is dying. Her son is dying. The mother gives her son the news. Her son is dying. The mother finds out that her son has left her & she is now alone with her dying son. The mother is dying of cancer. The mother tries to reach out & touch her son. She can't reach him. She lies in bed beside him as he dies. The mother is dying. The mother has given up. The mother is alone. The mother is dying. The mother is alone. The mother is dying. The mother is alone. The movie ends & the mother is left alone.

I cried during this movie. I cried at the end. I cried because the mother was alone. I cried because of the genius of the screenplay. I cried because this movie is so real. I cried because this movie is one of the best movies I
 I was shocked when I saw the title of this movie. It was obvious that the title was a pun on the original "The Evil Dead", which was also directed by Sam Raimi. I didn't know it was going to be a sequel. It was a good sequel though, even though it was more of a comedy than a horror movie. It was still pretty scary, though. I hope they make more sequels to this. I would really like to see a sequel to the original with Bruce Campbell as Ash.

Review by Jonathon "Jon" St. John

I'm surprised that the Evil Dead series didn't get a sequel in the early 80's, given how well it went over at the box office. The Evil Dead was a low-budget, independent horror film that made Sam Raimi a household name. There were plans for a sequel, but by the time it got to the point where it could be made, the original Evil Dead was a smash success and Raimi was getting more jobs.

Well, nearly 30 years later, the second sequel is finally here, and it's pretty good. The Evil Dead II is a near-
 This is a well-written and well-acted film. The characters are true to life, and the story is touching. I didn't like the ending, however, and feel that it was the wrong ending for this film. I think the family should have been reunited in the end, rather than what happened. Otherwise this was a very good film.

4.0 out of 5 stars Realistic, but disappointing ending. Format: DVD I rented this movie based on a recommendation of another film reviewer. I was not disappointed. I really feel the characters were very well developed and I was impressed with the realism of the story. The ending was a little disappointing in that it was not the ending I thought it would be. I would recommend this film.

4.0 out of 5 stars A touching story of a family Format: DVD I think this is a very moving film, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to see well-written, well-acted films. The acting is excellent, and the script is very well written. There is a lot of drama, but not so much that it becomes a soap opera. The music was very good too. I was very impressed with the actors' performances.


 This movie just works. It's so simple, so clear. It's so simple that it's almost obvious. It's not subtle, by any means, but it's just so straightforward and clean that it's as easy to grasp as the screen that it's on. It's also quite funny, which helps to keep the focus on the movie, rather than the movie itself. The plot is quite simple, as well, and works well enough: a man loses his job and his girlfriend, he's so depressed that he meets another woman who changes his life, and he goes from depressed to happy. The movie doesn't delve too far into this, however, and the characters don't have too much to say about their time together. This is one of my favorite movies, and I've been watching it since I was a child.

8/10

See it.

BONUS: If you're into music, George Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" plays during the film. It's quite good.

 On the surface, this film looks like another of those silly "sex and violence" movies, but it is much, much more than that. Stephen King re-imagines sexuality in a way that is deep and profound, not shallow and sensational. He shows how sexuality can be a powerful force in the life of a person, how it can be a destructive force, and how it can be a creative force. He also shows how sexuality can be a deep and loving connection between two people. He doesn't demonize sexuality, but he doesn't glorify it either.

He also shows how sexuality can be a deep and loving connection between two people. He doesn't demonize sexuality, but he doesn't glorify it either. The story is about a psychologist, Dr. Harkness. He is going to a conference in Colorado to present his latest book. He is also going there to see his ex-lover, Alex, who is a physician.

 This movie is a true story about a group of young boys doing what they enjoyed doing together (hunting) in the woods. The movie starts out with the boys in the woods hunting and one of the boys is shot in the neck and he passes out. The boys bring him to a cabin and they decide to leave him there and go home. The boys head back home and the next day they go back to the woods and one of the boys is shot and dies. The next day they go back to the woods and they find the boys rifle and they decide to keep it. The next day the boys go back to the woods and one of the boys is shot and killed by the same hunter. The boys decide that they are going to hunt the man responsible for all the boys getting killed. The boys do hunt the man but they don't find him until the man is captured by the police and is jailed for murder. The movie ends with the man getting sent to prison for life. I thought this movie was a great movie. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has shown the true story of a hunter killing dozens of boys. I think this movie shows what people are capable of doing. I saw this movie in the
 This is a very interesting book about a woman who has lived a very interesting life. I enjoyed reading it. I also enjoyed the movie. I did not enjoy the way the movie was made, but I did enjoy the book.

1.0 out of 5 stars I think it is a wonderful book but i think it should be made into a better movie Format: Hardcover i think this book is really really great. the main characters are really likeable and i really liked the way it was set out. i mean, i think it is really good that the main character felt like she could write it herself because sometimes books are really hard to read even when they are written by someone else, but that's just me. i have read lots of books and i think this is a really good one. i think it is really good that the main character is a girl because i think it is really important that books are written by girls and now i think that it is important that girls read books too. i think it is really good that the main character is not a boy because i think that a lot of people think that girls can't write books when they don't. i think it is really good that there is a boy in the
 It's the rare film that proves one thing is better than another, but I defy anyone to watch a scene from this film, and not feel at least a little better about life. Now, I'm not a complete cynic, but I'm not a total optimist either. I'm a realist. And I think this film brought me closer to that word. I don't know about you, but I need a little help sometimes. And this film gave me some. It made me feel like I was not alone, that there were others who felt the way I did, and that I wasn't crazy. I was okay. I wasn't alone. And I was okay. And I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

I can't think of a more moving film than this one. It brought me to my knees. I cried. And I cried. And I cried. I cried at the end. I cried at the beginning. I cried when the doctor told the mother to take the pills. And I cried with her. I cried with the little boy and the little girl. I cried with the little boy and the little girl when they were in the hospital. I cried when they were in
 I didn't really know what to expect when I saw this film. I am a huge fan of the series and had to see this one for myself. This film is made so well. The acting is great, the characters are great, the story is great, the direction is great. It is a great film and I am so glad they made it. I can't wait to see the next one!

5.0 out of 5 stars Bruce Campbell's Death's Head Returns to Bring Back the Bros Format: DVD Bruce Campbell's Death's Head, a man with a skull for a face and a cybernetic hand, has returned to bring back the old school British style of horror with a vengeance. If you've ever seen the eighties British horror classic The Abominable Dr. Phibes, or the slightly earlier BBC's The House That Dripped Blood, you'll have an idea of what to expect from this cult classic - a gory horror comedy with a dash of camp and a good dose of black comedy.

Death's Head is a supporting character in the long running BBC series Dr. Who, but it is here that he becomes the star with a tongue in his head and a chainsaw for a hand
 I really really really loved this movie. The music was great, the acting was great and the story was great. I think that this is a true story which I'm sure almost every teenage girl and boy can relate to. I don't know who to give it to but I think it's a movie that you have to watch.

 I gotta tell ya...this is a good movie. I have no idea why it's so low in the IMDb listings, but then again, I'm a huge nature nerd and have a huge interest in ecology, so I'm not sure what to expect. I'm not sure if the movie is really all that offensive, but some of the dialogue is sickening and I'd have to say it's presented in a way that's a little too "out there." I don't know...if you're into that kind of thing, then by all means, check it out.

I'm not sure whether or not I'll watch the sequel, but if it does come out, I'll probably be in line to see it. :-)

4/5 for me.

 A very good movie...and for fans of horror movies, the great horror actor Kurt Russell was in it, and it wasn't a horror movie! Kurt Russell did a wonderful job...and he is very good in the role, and he makes you feel for the character. The movie is about a man (Russell) who has a "problem" that causes him to be afraid of women. He is a fireman, and one day, after a fire, he is in a bar talking to a woman, and he finds himself unable to control himself, and he commits a horrible act, and he is sent to jail, and he is terrified, and he is put in the same cell with a woman, and he is afraid of her, and he is afraid of himself, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he is afraid of himself, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he is afraid of the other people in his cell, and he
 I didn't like this film when I first saw it, but I have changed my mind. I saw it again, with a new perspective. I have learned so much from this movie, and I am so thankful for it. It is a film that helps you grow and understand your own life, and if you can figure out what it is you are trying to say in the film, it can be a very rewarding experience. I try to watch it every now and then. It is truly an inspiring film, and one that can help one grow as a human being. It is a film to be watched with a parent or adult, because it is not really a kid's film. It is a grown up film. It's a beautiful film, but it is one that may not appeal to everyone, and that is why I gave it a 8 instead of a 10. If you like documentaries and the way they are presented, and you like a film that is inspirational and helps you grow as a human being, then you will enjoy this film.

 This is probably the only movie ever made about the city of Dallas, Texas. The film is based on a book by the same name written by James Leahey, who was a reporter for the Dallas Times-Herald. The film was directed by William A. Fraker, who also directed the movie "The First Deadly Sin" based on a book by Ann B. Ross. The movie stars a young Robert Duvall as the journalist who is sent to Dallas to cover the story of a family that has been murdered. The audience is not allowed to see the crime and the film becomes a study of the people at the crime scene. The film is based on the book "The First Deadly Sin" by Ann B. Ross, the same book that was used in the film "The First Deadly Sin".

The movie is not very long, and it is easy to follow the story. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see a good movie about a murder. The acting is good, and the story is exciting, but it is also very sad. A lot of people died at the crime scene.

I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.

 While the premise of this movie doesn't seem to be too original, it's execution makes up for it. The story is pretty simple, but the movie itself is very well done. The actors/actresses in this movie are excellent as well. They create a great atmosphere and make the movie completely believable. The leading couple, played by Tyler Labine and Megan Fox are both good and very believable. I had no problem whatsoever believing that they were together. They are both very believable in their roles. Most importantly, though, is that this movie has a great ending. It's one that I didn't see coming (and I'm usually pretty good at predicting things). It's a great ending to a movie that makes you laugh and cry a little as you're watching it. The overall rating for this movie is a 9. If you like romantic comedies, this movie is recommended.

Some movies just nail it. They hit the mark, and you can't help but feel good after watching them. This movie is one of those movies. The beginning of the movie is pretty predictable. But it's still an excellent movie. The actors are great, and the
 The first time I saw this show, I looked at the credits and saw the name of that big-shot director and thought, "I'm sure he'll do a great job with the show!". I was wrong.<br /><br />This guy is a hack, plain and simple. His first episode (the first one I saw) was so bad, I was looking forward to the second one. He stuck with the awful, bland story-line and didn't give a damn how badly he butchered the dialog and pacing. His actors are pretty good, but they're not supposed to be the stars of the show.<br /><br />The writing is sloppy, the pacing is awful, the acting is wooden and the plot is flimsy. The only reason I even kept watching was the actors, since writing was so bad, but they're not exactly helping themselves.<br /><br />As for the other reviewers who give this show a 10 and praise the writing, I have one word for you: (SPOILER)**<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><
 I saw this movie in the theater as a kid and I remember it as one of the best movies I've ever seen. I wanted to see it again just to see what it was all about. It is simply brilliant in its simplicity and the acting is perfect. But then again, the movie was made in 1963, what do you expect? Anyway, it is a great movie about a boy whose mother's death leaves him fatherless, and how he deals with the situation. The boy is played by the extremely talented child actor, Martin Sheen, who also plays one of the leads in the classic "West Side Story." The story is about a boy who is left fatherless when his mother dies. The boy, who is played by Martin Sheen, is told that she died in a car accident. He doesn't know what to believe, and the only way he can feel better is to get the people he loves to love him back. This is the first movie I have seen with a child actor in it. It was directed by the director of "The Graduate," and it was one of the first movies I saw post-Vietnam War. The movie is about a boy who believes his mother was killed in a car crash, and
 I've seen this movie several times now and it still amazes me. A very good movie and a great example of how a film can be both touching and funny in the right place. I'm not sure if it's a remake of a previous film or not but I've never seen a movie that combines so many elements of those genres. The story is good and the cast is fantastic. I've seen it twice now, and I'm glad I did. I hope someone makes a sequel so I can see this movie again. I look forward to buying the DVD if it ever comes out.

 It's great! One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's about a guy who is about to die of AIDS, and one of his last wishes is that he's not to be embalmed. As he lies dying the body begins to decompose, and the viewer is given a tour of the body as it comes apart. Very thought provoking, very well done. I strongly recommend it.

It's the best part of your day when you see a movie that really touches you. And this is a very touching movie. I have never seen anything like it. It's about a man who is dying of AIDS, and in his last moments he is asked to make a wish, and he says that he wants to be embalmed. As he is dying the body begins to decompose, and you see the process of the body coming apart. It's a very thought provoking movie, very well done. I strongly recommend it.

 I've seen this movie twice and I have to admit it is one of the best movies I've seen. It is a wonderful example of how a movie can be made on part of a real story, a true story. I love this movie. The acting is outstanding, the plot is fantastic, the music is great and the directing is just about perfect. A true story about real people is told in such a way that it becomes real to the audience. Just about everyone can find parts of their lives in this movie. It is wonderful for us as we can see how real people lived through the events of what happened during the war in my opinion. It is a movie that everyone should see at least once. I'm going to buy the dvd ASAP.

I have to say I have the greatest respect for anyone who can put themselves into a role and act it out so well. I'm sure I am not the only one who wishes they could be a great actor like Tim Dunigan. I think Tim is a great actor who has a good understanding of his role. This movie is a great example of how actors can make a movie what it is and
 I saw this movie at a screening in New York City. It was the best version of "The Many Lives of the Cat" I had ever seen. It was a perfect film. And I have seen dozens of them. The acting was great. The cinematography was great. The editing was very good. The story was very intriguing. The movie was very well done. I loved it. Anyone who would like to see this film should go see it. It's not a movie for kids. It's for adults. It's a very dark movie. It's not a movie for children.

 I've been watching this for about 2 years and I'm addicted, I watch it about 7 times a week and when I get my house cleaned I sit down and watch it, I love the way it's made, the characters, and the storyline. If you haven't seen it you must get it, it's really really good.

Terrance, that's my name! I'm a very pretty girl, but I'm not as beautiful as you.<br /><br />

There are a lot of people out there who are just like me, and there are some who aren't, but I know that the ones who aren't are the ones that don't care about me, because I'm not going to sit here and lie to you that I'm as beautiful as you are, but if you take the time to get to know me and the things I say, I'm sure you'll
 A woman (played by Blythe Danner) is a caregiver for a man (played by David Strathairn) who can't communicate. An old friend of the woman's (played by Ashley Judd) takes the man under her wing and helps him with his recovery. Along the way, several relationships are tested, as the woman and old friend, as well as the old friend and the man. <br /><br />This movie is just beautiful. It is not a fast paced film. Instead, it is composed of quiet moments that seem to go on forever. I watched it on a Sunday afternoon and I felt as if I was in a bubble. The film at one point was even described as "Moody". I can honestly say that I don't think I have ever been so involved in a movie. I was so invested in the characters that I wanted to see them happy. I wanted to see the old friend make the right decision. I wanted to see the new friendship blossom. I wanted to see the man make the right decision. <br /><br />This movie is very good. I was charmed by the characters and their relationships. Its like no other movie I have seen.
 Very interesting movie. It is best to see it as a documentary, and not at the theater. The movie has a very realistic feel to it, and the way it is filmed and edited is very good. It is a great movie to learn the history of the Mise-en-scene and the people who were a part of it. It is very educational. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes history, or just wants to learn a thing or two.

 I knew I was in for something special when I first watched a trailer for this movie. It's addictive. From the first frame to the last frame. It's a story about a young woman (played by Rachel Weisz) who has lost her memory after a car wreck. Her husband (played by Ray Liotta) is not exactly the best husband in the world, but he's not a terrible husband. He's just out for himself and not really concerned about what happens to his wife. Then she meets a guy (played by John Cusack) who is the exact opposite of her husband. He takes care of her and cares about her. She falls in love with him. The story is told from her point of view. It's a story about trust and love. I have to admit that I cried a few times watching this movie. It's a very special movie. It's about a woman who needs to be loved and needs to be cared for. This movie is worth watching.

 I saw this movie at the Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival and I was totally blown away. Toulky's story is a very deep and sobering one and he succeeds in bringing the characters to life and making us feel their pain and helplessness as we follow their struggles and their attempts in getting to the truth. It is a very moving film, sad and beautiful, and a true masterpiece.<br /><br />Toulky is a director to watch out for. I already know that he will be one of the new "big names" of the French cinema. And he has won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his first movie. I hope that his next movie will be as good as this and I hope that he will continue to make movies for a very long time.<br /><br />Just a great film to watch.

 When I first saw this movie, I was so shocked and excited that I watched it a few times in the first week. It was like a roller coaster ride, and I couldn't stand to ride the same ride twice, so I watched it again. Then I saw it a few more times, and it was so amazing that I decided to buy it. Then I watched it a few more times, and I got so invested in the characters that I started to cry at the end. This movie is definitely worth watching over and over. It teaches you a lot about relationships and how you should treat people. The movie is so good that I have watched it at least a hundred times, and I still get goose bumps when I watch it. This is truly a movie you should watch, and I think everyone in the world should see it at least once. I would definitely reccomend this movie to anyone.

 I saw this film at the Cannes Film Festival in France, and was absolutely amazed by it. I have never seen a film, before or since, which has the same level of emotional impact and profound honesty. The story of the innocent boy, who is raped by his father, and then in turn raped by his uncle, and then by his father again, and then by his uncle again, and then finally by his uncle's wife, is utterly shocking. It is a film which is difficult to watch, yet it is a film which I believe is one of the most important of the last few years. The scene where the boy is raped for the first time is truly shocking, and yet it is a film which is so honest, so direct and so powerful. This is a film which will stay with you for a long time, and it is a film which I believe everyone should see.

 This was the first time I watched a film by Godfrey Reggio and I loved it! It was a very moving film and I'm glad I got to watch it. I'm a big fan of Godfrey Reggio and I will be watching all his films. The acting was great, the story was great and it was very moving. The film is about a man who lives in the forest and he is being hunted by the police. He is a man who has been on a long journey and he has been trying to find out what happened to his wife. It's a very moving film and it is about a man who is trying to find out about his wife and how she died. Godfrey Reggio is a very talented director and I would recommend this film to all my friends.

 I love the old horror films. I think I was about nine when I saw "Dracula" for the first time. I have seen it several times since then. I don't think I've ever seen a horror film that has equaled this one. I saw "The Mummy" a couple of years later. That's a fun movie but it doesn't hold a candle to this one. It's scary, suspenseful and not campy at all. I was surprised to learn that the movie is based on a true story! I had never heard of it before. I think this movie is a must see for anybody who loves classic horror.

<br /><br />My favorite part of this movie is when the Mummy comes to life and attacks his victim. He looks like a mummy because he is wrapped in bandages. It was good to see that the mummy was given an original form because I've seen too many movies where he is a scary looking guy with a pointy hat. I think they were too influenced by the "Jason" movies.

<br /><br />My only problem with the movie is that it's too short. I think it should have been longer. They could
 This film is definitely worth a viewing if you are a fan of the bands that are featured in the movie. I found it a bit funny, but in the same time it was very touching. It's a story of friendship and hope, a story of loyalty and trust and of course the story of a dream coming true. It's a film that touches the heart, a film that I could watch again and again. It's hard to describe it - you have to see it.

It's not a documentary but a real movie, a film that you can watch with your friends, a film that you can share with your loved ones.

Go and watch it.

 I don't understand why the comments on the negative side are so harsh. I think this is the best television program I've ever seen. I'm a college graduate in Sociology, and I've seen a lot of shows. This is no exaggeration, this is the best show I've seen in my life, I think it is the best show ever made.<br /><br />I think that the only reason that people are giving this show low ratings is because they think that it is a bad show because they had already seen previous seasons. Well I think that is pretty stupid. If you had seen the previous seasons, then you would know that the show was actually good. When the show was new, I didn't know what to expect. I just thought that it was going to be another flop like the last time I had watched a show. This time, I didn't have that feeling. I actually thought that the show was really good, and the first season was very good. It was good, and I think the second season was even better. <br /><br />The show is very interesting and it keeps me on the edge of my seat. I think that the actors are very good at their roles,
 A family moves into a new house and the eldest son (Zach Galler) has a dream that their house is haunted. He decides to spend the night in the basement to see if his dream comes true. He is joined by his younger brother (Travis Willingham) and their friend (Sydney Park). Soon enough, he gets the whole family involved in his spooky adventure. This is one of the better films for the entire Galler family. This is low budget and does not have a lot of special effects, but it does have a good story, great acting and plenty of suspense. It has a nice twist at the end that will keep you guessing until the very end. This is a good family film that will keep the kids entertained.

 The best of the best. "Chill" is a tale of a mother who has just granted her husband's wish that she should live with him alone. She's a habitual alcoholic, and she hopes to get over her addictions through the good friends that she has made through the AA programme. Her husband is a successful businessman, and the two of them are living in the lap of luxury. In fact, the trouble is, their lives are so good, that they don't have anything to complain about. But, as the film unfolds, and we learn that they have actually got a son who is being kept away from them and his mother, this changes things.<br /><br />"Chill" is a wonderfully written and directed film, which has a great deal of depth to it. It's also an engrossing film, as the characters get their own back on the others, and we learn that there is more to people than meets the eye. It's a brilliantly acted film, and the two lead performances are outstanding.<br /><br />"Chill" is a wonderful film, and one that I believe everyone should see.

 I was never a big fan of Star Trek, but I do like the Star Trek movies and TV series. I think that perhaps I was expecting too much of this movie, and that is why I didn't like "Star Trek Nemesis". I like the idea that it is set in the same universe and is about the same characters. I like the cast of characters and the storyline. <br /><br />However, I found myself not being able to concentrate on the movie because I was constantly being distracted from the action by the "costumes". The crew of the Enterprise in the film are wearing some kind of futuristic outfits - reminiscent of the Romulan uniforms from the first Star Trek movie. The costumes, which were designed to look like an intergalactic version of something like a group of modern day people, were just not very good. But it is just a matter of opinion, and it is quite possible that I am not being fair to the film.

<br /><br />Overall "Star Trek Nemesis" is a good movie, but I think that the costumes could have been better.

 I went to see this film with a friend and I was pleasantly surprised. It's about a couple of kids who are attacked by a group of men and women who want to take the teenagers to their parents. Who should the kids be taken to but their parents who are the bad guys. There are a few twists and turns in the movie before it's over. The script is written well and the actors are really good. A good independent film worth seeing.

I bought this movie because I liked it very much, and I am very grateful to the people who made it, who are Jane Root and Alex Smith. They are very good. I like a lot of people who are in this movie. I like Michael Shannon. I like Rosemarie DeWitt. I like Michael Cera and Chris Eigeman and Emily Watson who is really good. I saw the movie twice and the second time, I didn't know it was the same movie. It was like night and day. So I would recommend this to everybody.

 This movie is arguably one of the most discreet and subtle movies ever made. It tells the story of the dangers that are hidden behind the innocent eyes of children. The story is about a boy named Michael who has a little sister named Sara. One day Michael's mother is called away on a business trip, and she leaves Michael in charge of his little sister. Michael's mother works for a secret government agency, and one of the things she does is to administer routine background checks on people. There is a problem, however, because Michael and his mother have fallen in love, and the agency's policy is not to allow married couples to work together. When the couple accidentally discover that they are being investigated, they are forced to take drastic measures.<br /><br />This movie is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. It is certainly one of the more disturbing comedies I have ever seen, but it is also one of the most honest movies I have ever seen. This movie is a perfect example of how you can use humor to teach valuable lessons. The best way to show this is through the use of a child. Throughout the movie, Michael's character is portrayed as a child, as is his sister. It is through
 I just saw this film yesterday, and it was a great film. I thought it was very funny, and I was not surprised that it was funny. I didn't think it was too long, (and it was not) but I think it could have been shorter. Overall, I think that everyone should see this movie. I would give it a 9 out of 10.

my rating: 9/10

(In reply to a comment): I agree with you. I thought the trailer was funny, but the movie was even funnier. The only reason that I didn't give it 10 was because there was one part that was kind of boring. I would give this movie a 9 out of 10.

 I've never seen this film so I can't really say if it's a great representation of the musical in general, but it is a very good film about the making of the musical and the people who love it so much. The cast is great and the music is just wonderful. It's a film that can be summed up in a few words: "It's the people who love the show, not the show itself." If your a fan of the show, you'll definitely love this movie.

10 out of 10 for me.

Love Hurts: The Ira Gershwin Story (2003) A talented, but uneven musical. 21 December 2003 - 1 out of 1 users found this review helpful. This film is based on a book written by Ira Gershwin's widow, which was the only surviving document of his life. The film had a mixed critical reception, but I felt it was very entertaining. I loved some of the performances and found the story very interesting. I felt the film was uneven, and at times the performances fell flat and were not believable. But I loved the casting of the film and thought it was a very entertaining film
 I read the other reviews and I don't get it. If you are a fan of the book, you will enjoy seeing all the characters on the screen. If you read the book, you will enjoy seeing all the characters on the screen. If you never read the book, you will enjoy seeing all the characters on the screen. This is a great film, and the only complaint I have is that the film is too short. I have seen it twice, and I still have not finished it. I am going to read the book now. I am not sure that I would have enjoyed the film any more if I had read the book first. I think it's a great way to get a feel for the characters and the story and then go on to read the book. The book is a great way to gain a deeper insight into the characters and the setting. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good drama and wants to learn more about the characters.

 I saw this movie on cable (not really cable, but a movie channel that played old black and white classics) and I loved it. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is very well acted and the movie is great. I also liked it because it has a touch of mystery and romance to it. It is a great movie to watch if you are looking for a good movie to watch.

This movie is about a young girl named Mary and her father who works for the railroad in the 1930's. Mary's father is constantly working and he is always putting his job before his family. One day Mary's father decides to take a vacation to a small town. He plans to stay there for a whole week. He takes his daughter along with him because he wants to teach her a lesson on the proper way to live her life. While they are there, a murder occurs at the hotel and Mary's father is the prime suspect.<br /><br />I think this movie is a great movie because it is very well put together. I think it is very well thought out and very well done. I think it is a great movie because it
 A movie about the overzealousness of the American military and the media's insatiable desire to paint the enemy as the boogie man of the decade, this movie is not to be missed. The American public's view of the war in Vietnam has been skewed by the movies and television. The truth is much different than that of the media and Hollywood. This movie gives us the real story of the war. I can't believe that this movie is 35 years old and still relevant today. This is one of the best movies ever made.

The movie is very well acted by the veteran actors, and is extremely well directed. It's a movie that you want to see again.

I also recommend Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.

p.s. I don't want to sound like an arrogant son of a bitch, but I'm sure glad I lived through the 60's and attended high school in the early 70's, when this movie was made.

 I watched this show when it came out and I loved it. I thought the character development was amazing. Spotty, the little girl, had a great relationship with her brother, Jeff, and her dad, Ken. Spotty's mom, Linda, was not a very good mom and although she did love her kid, she didn't understand her and didn't always pay attention to her, which was a problem because she was a very smart little girl, who was very good at math. The show also had an interesting storyline, where they had a lot of family problems, which weren't explained in detail, but it was obvious that a lot of things not related to the show were going on, which made the show even better. A lot of reviewers have said that the show was dumb, but I thought that it was entertaining, and I didn't find it dumb. I was crying when the little boy, Corey, died, and I thought it was a very sad death. I also thought that the show was very educational. The shows helped me with math because I am good at math. I loved this show.

 As a movie junkie I have seen a lot of movies and this was my first time watching this movie. It was a very interesting movie. The story was very interesting and it had some great acting in it. But the best part of this movie was the ending. You had to see it to understand it. I have never seen a movie with a good ending to it, that was so good. It was a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. This movie should be nominated for a lot of awards and it should win a couple of them. This movie is about a young boy named Toby whose father is a war veteran who has suffered from amnesia. Toby is a very smart kid and he has the ability to read people minds. Toby gets the idea that he is the only one who can help his father remember. This is a must see movie.

 I saw this film recently on a TV station and was very surprised at the quality of the film. I am a huge fan of this director and I have seen a lot of his films, but this is one that I have never seen even though I own several of his films. I bought the movie used for $4.00 because I felt it was one of his best. I also felt that I had to tape it because I wanted to see it again.<br /><br />The movie is very well made, the characters are well drawn and the film is shot very well. I liked the story, I liked the way the film was shot and I liked the way the director made the film.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was disappointed in the dialog. There was very little conversation in the film and the dialog was very dry. The dialog in the film was very short and I felt that the film could have benefited from a little more dialog. I also felt that the dialog was a little too obvious and that it didn't really add anything to the film, but that is a minor complaint.<br /><br />Overall I think that this film is one of the best films that I have seen in a while. The director
 Yes, I'm the first person to say it, but I loved this movie. It was charming, funny, and enjoyable.<br /><br />I loved the premise of it. It was like watching a really good, very funny, black and white, silent film. There was always something going on and it never got old. The characters were likeable, although I can't say I found any of them extremely likeable. It was a perfect way to spend an evening. I was completely taken away from my problems. I was just happy to be in the movie and relax. I loved it.

<br /><br />I also loved the music. It was so simple and fun. The actors were great. I especially liked the way they dressed. I thought that was really clever. I really liked the way the movie used music to make the movie more enjoyable. I also loved the way it was shot. I thought the movie was really creative. I really liked the way the movie used words in it's dialogue. I thought that was really refreshing. I thought it was a great way to make the movie more enjoyable.

<br /><br />I also loved the way the movie was shot.
 I wanted to watch this movie since i saw the trailer and it didn't disappoint. The story was great and the acting was pretty good. The movie was very funny, i even laughed at some of the situations they got themselves in. The only problem i had was that the movie was a little bit too long. The movie really could have been 5 or 6 minutes shorter. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.<br /><br />8/10

It's an excellent movie, with a very strong plot. The acting is good, and the storyline is very good, but for me the best thing about this movie is the ending. I was expecting it to end in a very dramatic way, but it didn't. I was expecting a twist, and that's what I got. I was very surprised in the fact that it didn't have a twist. I was expecting a bad guy to get killed. But I was very wrong. The director did a very good job in the way he made this movie. The plot is very good
 "The Great Train Robbery" is a very entertaining movie with a great cast and a great story. The story starts with two criminal gangs in the UK planning to rob the Great Western Railway. The ruling gang is the "White Boys" and the other gang is the "Red Indians". The film was based on the "Great Train Robbery", but the story is about the leader of the Red Indians, played by Kirk Douglas, and his attempts to stop the Great Western Railway by robbing it.<br /><br />The cast is great; Robert Newton, Trevor Howard and Richard Todd are all very good in their roles. Newton and Newton's character are from the Red Indians gang, and Todd is from the White Boys. The story is very well done and the movie is very entertaining. I highly recommend this movie.

The Great Train Robbery is a very entertaining movie that is almost flawless. Robert Newton, Trevor Howard and Richard Todd are all great in their roles as well as the rest of the cast. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good British film. I would also recommend that you watch this movie
 Wow. This is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time. The basic idea of the movie is to imagine what the world would be like if the great depression had happened in the modern world. The movie is totally unbelievable, the characters are pure fiction, the setting is the present day world and the movie is shot in Germany. It is a really really really really good movie. It is a perfect mix of comedy and drama and it is not a long movie. If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your friends, this is the movie to watch.

 This movie is written, produced, and directed by the same guy that wrote and produced "The Ice Storm" (1997) with Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. This movie is a punch in the face. A long hallway with a lot of doors with numbers on them. In most of these rooms is a person who is upset. I have seen the movie twice. Once with my girlfriend and once with my fiancee. Both times I had the same reaction. First, I was angered by the characters. Second, I was amazed at the acting. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark comedy.

This is a very well written, acted, and directed movie. The story is well thought out, the acting is excellent, and the director has a great eye for detail and the effects are very good. I really enjoyed the movie. I think this movie is one of those movies that is not going to be talked about for a long time, but I do plan on watching it again.

 This movie was absolutely fantastic. If you are a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, Sam Rockwell, and Martin Lawrence this is a movie you must see. The chemistry between the three actors is great, and they all are so funny in this movie. The story is very simple but it is still very funny. If you can watch only one movie this year, make it this one.

The DVD comes with a nice selection of extras including a behind the scenes look at the filming, a "Making of" featurette, and a music video of the song "I'm Real" from the movie.

This was a great movie. It was very funny, and it was also very sad. It is about a guy who gets a job as a football coach and he is not prepared for the amount of pressure that is on him. It is a very intense movie and the emotions are very strong. There are some great actors in this movie, and I am really looking forward to seeing the sequel.

 In a sequel to "The Thing" (1982), a group of people are trapped in a remote location, where they are attacked by a shape-shifting alien organism. The film is well-made, with good special effects and a very good cast. John Carpenter's direction, however, is a disappointment. With such a great cast, Carpenter's direction is simply pedestrian. The acting is very good, however. Keith David is wonderful as a disillusioned scientist. Donald Moffat and Burt Young do a good job as well. Also, James Farentino is good as a college professor. And the effects are generally very good. The biggest problem with the film, however, is the story. The screenplay, by Carpenter and Jaime de Angulo, is not particularly good. Also, the character of "MacReady" is rather one-dimensional. The film, however, is watchable; it's well-made, with good special effects and a very good cast.

 This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in the past 15 years. The way it was shot is one of the things that added to the movie. The camera work was done very well. The acting by all the actors is good. They have the ability to give a realistic performance. And the story was very well written. I have seen this movie many times and it still is as good as the first time I saw it. The acting and the cinematography are really good. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

I can't tell you what a good movie it is because I can't find anything wrong with it. It's a pretty good movie. The ending was happy, as well as the whole ending of this movie. It was good when it was done. I liked it. I think it was a good movie, and I do not think it was a bad movie. This is a good movie to watch.

Lethal Weapon 3

Lethal Weapon 3 has got to be one of the funniest movies ever made. It has a great cast of actors and it's one of the best comedies ever made. It's got Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Michael Rapaport, Jon Voight, Traci Lords, Gary Busey, Rene Russo, Danny Trejo, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Rene Russo, Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Michael Rapaport
 I really enjoyed this show. I know that it didn't get very much publicity and I'm surprised that I even found it. The story was a little askew for me, but I just think that it was because I was expecting to see some of the characters where they were in the book. The story was a little different, but I liked it. I think that the actress who played Alice, was great and I loved the way that she did her lines.<br /><br />I really didn't think that the show would last as long as it did, but it has run for several years. I really don't know how the show continues to get better, but I'm glad that it does. I'm sure that the show will continue for a long time and I'm glad that I finally got to see it. I can't believe that I only got to see this show when I was about 14, but I'm glad that I did. I really didn't think that it would be so good, but I'm glad that I'm glad that I got to see it. I'm really glad that I got to see this show, and I can't wait to see the next season. I hope that you will
 This is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year, and most definitely up there with the best. It's a great movie to watch anytime, but especially during the Christmas holidays. The performances are outstanding. The cinematography is terrific. The music is very well chosen. The writing is very good, and the direction is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I highly recommend it.

 I'm not sure what it is about this movie and it's characters but I just keep coming back to it. I think I've seen it at least five or six times and it was one of those movies that I was always looking for when I was a kid. I remember watching it with my dad when I was like nine or ten and I thought it was stupid but afterwards I felt like I had to buy it on VHS. I think it was the trying to get into the car part that got me into it. I also remember watching it with my cousin when she was like eight years old and she fell asleep halfway through. I have the original version with my dad's original commentary on it. There are a few other versions out there with slightly different lines but the original one I have is perfect and it even has the same commentary track. I just love this movie and I'm so happy that I found it. It's got a few good lines and it's got a good story.

 This is a very inspiring film for anyone seeking a new way of looking at the world. I don't want to give away all the surprises however, but I would like to say that the film is not trying to be a "feel good" movie. In short, it is a movie about how, by looking at the world through our own eyes, we can learn to overcome the problems we face in our lives. I really felt that I could relate to the characters in the film. I could understand their emotions and the reasons behind their actions.<br /><br />I would recommend the film to anyone who likes films that are not the usual "feel good" films - films that remind us that the world is much more complex than we may realize.<br /><br />The DVD is worth purchasing just to watch the extras. The documentary, "The Making of 'Secret Honor'", is extremely interesting, especially to those who have seen the film.

 As a fan of the original, I was disappointed with this remake. In the original, the story is a bit slow, but the characters are well defined. In the remake, the story is slow, but the characters are less well defined. In the original, the characters have a bit of a dark side. In the remake, they are more dashing and charming. The remake is funny, but it is not as funny as the original. One of the major differences in the remake is the lack of a central character. In the original, the viewer is swept up in the story of a man trying to escape a life of crime. He meets a woman and a bunch of oddballs, and the viewer is involved in their personal stories. In the remake, there is no central character. The viewer is involved in the story of the two main characters, but the viewer is not as involved in the other characters. The remake is a little more crude than the original. I like the original much better.

 I read the book and thought it got a bit too close to the "Twilight Zone" this book is far more like an episode of the Twilight Zone where the protagonist shrinks in size and the town goes mad. In the book the protagonist, Milly, is a normal sized girl her whole life. She gets sick and her body breaks down to a size of an egg. She tells the town she is sick and they all ignore her and she is shunned. In the movie, Milly is a normal sized girl and she is an accepted member of the town. She is able to watch the Rambos and enjoy their parties because she is small enough to go in and out of their house. The Rambos treat Milly as if she is one of their children. I think the movie would have been so much better if the director had thought about what would happen when Milly turns into a giantess. She would be shunned, ignored and probably called a monster and locked away. I think this is a good movie and if you like the Twilight Zone, you will like this movie a lot.

 After watching a bunch of these movies I've got to say that this is my favorite. I've watched it several times, and I think it gets better every time I watch it.<br /><br />I think it's the best movie with a female lead that I've seen. She's very intelligent, she's not exactly beautiful, but she's not ugly either. I think it's a very good movie, and I think it's for everyone to watch.

I can't say enough good things about this movie. Not only is it a great movie, it's also a great documentary. I think the best part of it is that it's real life.<br /><br />It starts out by basically following a few people through their everyday lives. It shows how they view things, how they react to things, how they see the world, how they live their lives, how they think, how they see others. It shows different people, it shows different situations. It shows the real people, not the actors. I think that's the reason why
 I must admit I was surprised when I read the summary for this movie. Many of the images of the movie that popped into my head were only alluded to in the brief summary, regardless of the fact that the movie was a unique, bizarre, and entertaining movie. I loved the movie and felt it was very well done. I won't spoil it by giving it away but it is a very original idea. I am glad they decided to make this movie. The cast was all great and they did a great job together. I was very impressed with the two young actors who had the most lines, and they were very good. The movie was very quirky and humorous. I really enjoyed the film and looked forward to seeing the sequel.

I will say that the movie was not for everyone, but I think it is for a large number of people.

Have a look at the movie, then decide for yourself.

If you like movies that have a good cast and great story line, this movie is for you.

 I have to say that I am really going to miss this show. It was a very funny show, and had a really good cast. I think it was one of the first shows I had seen with a gay character being a main character. Usually in shows like this, the main character is straight. In every episode, you could always count on the characters to make you laugh. The characters were fun to watch, and they had great chemistry together. On a side note: I think that their should be a spin off show with the characters from this show. I think they could make a great show with the characters, and I think that we could be seeing it soon. I hope that the show gets picked up. I would love to see the characters again. It would be great to see them do a movie with the same characters. I know I would like to see that. Even if it is not with the characters, I think that it would be fun to see Matthew Perry and John Krasinski film something. I think that it would be interesting to see them together. They both have great chemistry together. It would be great to see them work together. I think that the show was really good and it had a really good cast
 This episode is one of the best of the season. It has a nice blend of serious and light moments, and features a great performance from the always good Paul Reubens. It also features a great little cameo at the end by the late, great John Ritter. Overall, it's a great episode, and well worth a look.

 I would like to say that I am a big fan of all of the young adult books by John Green. He is the author of The Fault in Our Stars, Paper Towns, and Looking for Alaska. I have read all of these books and I found them to be great. However, I do have to say that Paper Towns is my favorite. The story revolves around Quentin and Margo. They have been best friends since they were kids and they have known each other forever. This is a story about Margo's dad who is a famous author. He has a new book out that is a love story. The problem is that the book is not a love story but a mystery novel. Margo and Quentin are trying to figure out who the mystery writer is. They decide to find out who it is by going to the houses of the people mentioned in the book to see if they have a clue to who the person is. There is a lot of drama in this book, but it is also a pretty funny book. The two main characters are really good friends and I really liked them. This is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book to read.

 I am glad that I saw this movie. I thought it was pretty good. The story was good and I did get a little bit concerned that maybe they wouldn't be able to keep it going. But they did! I did think the acting was good. I was very pleased that they chose to use the real names of the family. It was also nice that they did not focus on the problems that the family was having. Rather, they focused on the fact that they were dealing with a family member with disabilities. I thought that was a good idea. The movie seemed to be a little long but it kept my attention the whole way through. I was very glad that it was shown on television. I think that is a great way to show movies like this to people.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a family member with any kind of disability. I think it would be a very interesting movie for anyone who has a family member with a disability. It would probably be especially interesting for those who have a family member with Autism. I think it would be a good movie for any family to watch.

I give this movie a high rating, 8/10.

 I found this movie to be very sentimental and, at times, hilarious. The humor was very good. The performances were also very good. I thought that, at times, the acting was a bit over the top, but I found this to be a very funny movie. I think that this movie is great for those who like movies about the youth and the 60s, as well as those who like to laugh at people who are a little off center. This movie will make you laugh and it will also make you think.

I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that I would be bored by this movie, but I found myself laughing throughout the movie. The movie was very funny, and I enjoyed it a great deal. I think that you will, too.

This movie is a bit strange and funny and I liked it because I don't know characters as much as I like movies. I think it is a good movie and I recommend it. I like it because it is different than other movies but I recommend it because it is a good movie and I liked it. I recommend this movie because I liked it and I like it because it is a good
 I have seen several films about the Viet Nam war, and this is certainly one of them. It's a very moving story, and although at times it is hard to watch, it is worth it. The movie is not about Vietnam, but about the unfulfilled promise of a young man who grew up in a poor, uncaring family. The film is a tribute to a good man, and the sacrifice he made to help his comrades. This film has become a classic, and is one of the best films on the Vietnam war. It's a very moving story, and is not a typical war movie. It shows the good and bad sides of the war, and shows the serious consequences of war.

I would recommend this movie, especially to those who have had the misfortune to see the war first-hand or in a very small way. The message that the movie is trying to convey is one that we need to hear. The movie shows war first-hand, and what a terrible thing it can be. This story is a tribute to a man who did not ask for the sacrifice he made, but accomplished it gladly. This movie is a great tribute to a good man and a great film.

9/10
 This is a really strange film. It's like something that you would see in a weird alt-culture subcult film festival that only took place once a decade. The film itself is just the three main characters going about their day. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but there's some mild nudity, some drug use, and a lot of weirdness. The film is highly stylized, and it's about as good as you can get for a weird film, but it's really strange. All in all, I'd give it a B.

 Wow what an utter disappointment. I think that maybe I was expecting too much from this movie. I was very excited to see this movie, as I've been reading the book series for quite a while now, I just couldn't wait for it to be made into a movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't like the movie as much as I thought I would, maybe because it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but I think that it was because it was pretty much like a Saturday morning cartoon and I'm not a fan of that style of movie.<br /><br />I think that the casting was very good, and the special effects were pretty good. It's just a shame that the story wasn't that good. I'd give the movie a 2 out of a 5 star rating.

Good but not great

Not a bad film. The story line was good and it was nice to see the books on screen. It's been a long time since I read the books. The
 I'm a huge fan of the BBC's adaptations of Jane Austen's novels, having seen all of the best-known ones at least twice, and this was one of the better ones. The story of the main characters are well-told, and I thought that Jeremy Brett was a very good choice for Mr. Darcy. I like the way that he is portrayed as a highly intelligent, extremely practical, and very romantic man. I thought that the supporting characters were good too, although I can't say that the younger Mr. Bingley was the most appealing. But then, Mr. Darcy was supposed to be very good looking, so that's hardly a surprise.<br /><br />I liked the way that the story was told, as there were a lot of flashbacks, which helped to emphasize Mr. Bingley's character. The story also made a good point about the dangers of pride, especially with regard to Miss Elizabeth. The story did a good job of presenting the theme of Pride and Prejudice without being over-the-top, and I thought that the movie was very well balanced. I also thought that the actors who played Mr. Bennet and Mr. Collins were very good, especially Richard E.
 Time has certainly not been kind to this film, which was made in the late 1950's, but which was not released until the early 60's. It is unfortunate because the film is actually a good one, with a good cast (including Julie Christie, of course), some very good acting and a good story. I especially liked Joan Radcliff, who seems to have been the lead in this film, because she gave a very good performance. I also thought that the film was very well made, with some wonderful outdoor shots. It is a pity that this film was not released, because it might have done better in the box office than it did. However, it is still a good film to watch now, and I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. It is not a bad film, and it is definitely worth watching, even now.

 I am sure that this movie will never be released on DVD, but it is a great film, with an interesting story and a wonderful performance by Joanne Woodward. I watched it at least 100 times, and still find it as good as the first time I watched it. It is a crime that this movie will never be released on DVD. It is a truly great film.

I have not read the book, but I have read reviews by others, and they are all very positive. I think the book must be better. I know that I have read a few other books by Nelle Richmond, and I have enjoyed all of them. I most recommend this movie for all to see.

 "The Battle of the Sexes" is a comedy that takes place in the world of tennis. The movie is based on the real life of Billie Jean King (Emma Stone), who is a female tennis champion. The movie is also based on the story of how men and women used to fight in the world of tennis. It is an interesting story, and it is definitely different from any of the other romantic comedies that I have seen. The movie is hilarious, and it is one of the funniest movies of the year. It is the best movie to watch with a group of friends. The movie is also good for people who love tennis. It is also a movie about a woman who is a champion, and I love it. The movie is also good for people who love sports. The movie is also good for people who like sports and romantic comedies. Emma Stone is good in this movie. I love the movie and I think that everyone should see it.

 Perhaps the best entry in the series, "The Day the Earth Caught Fire" should be viewed by anyone who is interested in the genre. A good mix of character development, action, and science fiction keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters are well developed, and Charlie Chaplin's performance as the villain is excellent. The story is simple, but the impact of each scene is powerful. The special effects are good, but don't make you think the film is a "B" grade movie. You can see the effects were done on a low budget, but it does not detract from the storyline of the film. The only fault I can find with the film is it seems a little too long. At times it seems the film could have been shortened. Still, it is a film worth seeing.

This film is also available on DVD under the title "Life On The Fire Line"

 I have seen this movie a few times and I still love it. I have also seen the remake, and I think that this is a much better film. I believe that this movie is a fun and entertaining film. The plot is great and the acting is, of course, awesome. I would recommend this film for anyone, even for people who are not into horror. This film is, in my opinion, the best horror film to come out in a long time. This is a must see film.

I was so excited to get this movie, since I have been a fan of horror since I was a child, and I thought that this one was going to be the best movie I had ever seen. However, although the film is fun, I don't think it is scary. The movie is great, but it is not the best horror film I have ever seen. I think that this is a great film, and even though it is not scary, it has a lot of great moments. The acting was
 I have watched this movie a few times and each time I discover something new. The first time I watched it I was amazed by the way they built the house that the couple owns and how the house seems to have a mind of its own. The second time I watched it I saw how the writer and director used the house to show the inner conflicts of the couple. The third time I watched it I was amazed at the way the director and writer used the house to show the frustrations of life. The fourth time I watched it I was amazed at the way the director and writer used the house to show the realities of small town life. The fifth time I watched it I was amazed at the way the director and writer used the house to show the realities of growing up. The sixth time I watched it I was amazed at the way the director and writer used the house to show the realities of mortality. The seventh time I watched it I was amazed at the way the director and writer used the house to show the realities of growing old. The eighth time I watched it I was amazed at the way the director and writer used the house to show the realities of death.<br /><br />This movie is about a house that is alive, it
 I think I'd have to say that this is one of the best Oz movies ever made. I don't know how you can transform such a boring book into a movie, but this is what they did. I'll admit that I was a little disappointed when I saw the movie because I thought the movie would be a disappointment, but it wasn't. I thought that it kept the original story pretty much intact, but the characters were changed a bit and the movie was a little more violent. Not too much though. I think that the best part of the movie was how they portrayed the characters. I liked how they made the Scarecrow more timid and not as brave as he is in the book. They made the Tinman more likeable and not so scary. The best part of the movie was the part with the Cowardly Lion. It looked like they got the voice and personality of the Cowardly Lion right on the spot. The rest of the characters weren't quite as good as the Cowardly Lion, but the movie was still good nonetheless. I thought that they did a good job of making a movie out of the book. Tommy Kirk is a good actor and I think he did a good job of portraying Jack Pumpkin
 I actually watched it when it first came out on TV. A lot of people complained that this movie was too long and it was a bit slow, so I didn't watch it very much, but I have seen it a few times since then. I have watched it a few more times since then. I think that it is perfect. There is not a single thing I would change. The characters are wonderful, the story is great, and the acting is so good. I always get choked up when I watch this movie. I think that this is one of the best movies ever made. Everyone should see it. It is about two girls who are trying to find their fathers and their mother who has been missing for years. I love this movie. I think that anyone who likes action, romance, comedy, or drama will like this movie. I think that this movie gives you a lot of things that you want in a movie. There is action, romance, and comedy. I think that this is one of the best movies ever made. I would give it 10/10. I think that everyone should see it.

 The story of the relationship between a wealthy man and a poor young man who come from different worlds is presented in a very interesting and detailed way. The narrator (who also appears in several scenes) is also very well performed by John Turturro. He plays the character of Gio, a depressed young man who lives in a run-down apartment with his mother, brother and sister. Gio has just been released from a mental hospital, and is trying to recover from the effects of his stay. He is also still having some serious problems from his time in the hospital. It is a very sad story that shows the difference in the way people think and live. The older man is unable to understand the way Gio thinks, but is determined to help him. During the course of the film, the older man and Gio begin to teach each other some new things. The older man shows Gio the world of wealth and luxury, and he shows him how to be less depressed and how to enjoy life.<br /><br />The acting by John Turturro and the younger actors is excellent. The direction by Mark Pellington is very good, as well. I enjoyed this movie a lot.

 This movie is about a girl named Bella (played by Isabella Rosselini) who has a boyfriend named Johnny (played by Rupert Everett). They are very happy in their relationship, until there is a party at the beach and Johnny's best friend, Jake (played by John Cusack) gets drunk and kisses Bella. Bella is so shocked by this, that she breaks up with Johnny. After this, Bella becomes pregnant. Her boyfriend, Johnny, doesn't want to be a father and gives up his child. Bella moves to a new city and becomes a single mother. She meets a new boy, Jasper (played by Chris Evans) and they become friends. Bella's pregnancy causes her to use birth control and she gets pregnant again. Jasper is the father of this child and Bella wants to keep it, even if it is an accident. Bella decides to have an abortion and the film ends with a happy ending. This film is not great, but it's not bad. I give it a 2 out of 4.

*I recommend this movie for girls and boys.

 I have never seen such a poor sequel to a classic film. This film is so bad that I can't even imagine what kind of director would have made it. I don't think that the script was even taken from the book, which is a shame, because the script is so far off that I can't even begin to describe it. The film was so boring that I was constantly dozing off, as if I was in a trance. The only good thing about the film was the special effects. Maybe there were some good scenes in the book, but I can't remember any because the film was so dull. I am not saying that the book is a classic, but this film is so dull that it is hard to believe that the writer of the book could have written it.

The really sad part of this film is that they had a great cast, particularly the young girl who played the character of the little girl from the book. But the director could not decide whether she should be a good girl or a bad one, so she ended up being both at the same time.

I am surprised that the author didn't sue the director for stealing his book.

2/10

** out of ****
 I was lucky enough to see this film in the theater when it was released in America. I really enjoyed the film and was impressed that it hadn't been submitted to the MPAA for a rating. It was certainly a visually stunning film and the performances were great. It's certainly a film that deserves a wider audience than it has. If you're like me and enjoy seeing films that have not been submitted to the MPAA and are not shown in mainstream theaters, then this is a film to seek out.

I'll have to see it again sometime soon.

I saw this movie for the first time this weekend. It was so amazing. There is so much detail in the design of the house, the costumes, the sets, the costumes, the props, the dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, the music, the colors, the lighting, and the amazing story line. I'm so glad I watched it again today. I love this movie.

 This movie is one to be watched. I've seen it twice, the second time in a theater, the first time on TV. I have to say, I was truly impressed with the acting, cinematography, and sound of this movie. It is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. The acting, the cinematography and the sound quality are all excellent. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to anyone who likes the book. I give it 10 out of 10!

A True Classic

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I absolutely loved this movie. I was so excited when I saw it playing in the theater and it didn't let me down. It is full of suspense, action, and all kinds of emotions. I especially liked the way the movie kept me guessing. I thought it was going to be a comedy, and then it developed into a drama. It reminded me of "The Usual Suspects" by the way it started. I have seen the movie twice now and I still love it. I think everyone should take time to
 I have a confession to make. I'm a big fan of the 1970's TV show, "The Bionic Woman." I remember when I was a little girl watching it in the late 1970's and early 1980's. I'm also a big fan of "The Six Million Dollar Man." It just so happens that they star in the same 1970's TV show "The Six Million Dollar Man" and "The Bionic Woman." I decided to watch "The Six Million Dollar Man" because it was a remake of "The Six Million Dollar Man" and "The Bionic Woman." I loved it! The beginning of the movie was okay. It didn't really impress me. But then the movie got better. My feeling is that the movie was really good because it had something to do with the two stars in a way. I'm not going to reveal anything about it. You'll just have to watch the movie. I'm sure you'll like it. It's kind of a classic but it's not for everybody.

My rating for this movie is 9/10.

My favorite part of the movie is the bionic man and the bionic woman.

 I finally found a copy of this movie at a thrift store and I'm very glad I did. It's a great movie filled with great actors, a great story and a great script. It's got everything a great movie should have. Unfortunately, it's been out of print for years and it's a shame because it's a great movie. I can't believe it's not better known. The characters are rich and complex, the story is great, the acting is superb and the direction is amazing. It's a great film and a great commentary on the times it was made and is still relevant today. It's not a perfect movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a good one.

2.0 out of 5 stars An Interesting Try, But... Format: VHS Tape The original The Great Santini was a remarkable movie, and a lot of people say it's even better after the home video release.

The picture looks good, but the sound is bad, there is no
 This is a very moving film with excellent performances. The story is told in flashbacks and it is a very sad story. The film is very well directed and the flashbacks are very well done.

 The story of this film is one of the most tragic of all time. The director, Joseph H. Lewis, was a great director and still is. I don't know much about the other actors in this film, but the main one, Martin Landau, was an actor that I was already a fan of. I have a few of his films on DVD and I've seen him in many other films. He always gives his all and his performance in this film is no different. He plays a man that is in a wheelchair and he is a little mischievous and always looking for trouble. He lives in a fairytale world and he believes that his wife is the one that can take care of the fairytale world and he, too, is bad. He is always getting into trouble and he gets into many, many, many fights with his wife. This is a very good film and is a great film to watch with a few friends. It is a classic and I highly recommend it.

 I really should have watched this sooner. The acting is not as good as I was expecting, but the storyline is very original, and the interactions between the different characters are very well done. The cinematography is beautiful, and the soundtrack is also very good, but isn't too overpowering. The storyline is somewhat predictable, but there are no real dull moments, and the acting is good enough that it doesn't matter. I enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it.

The premise of the movie is this: A small band of astronauts are sent to another planet in a large spacecraft, and they find a small group of people there.

However, the astronauts soon realize that the people are not as primitive as they thought, and that there is a lot of technology hidden beneath their primitive lifestyle.
 I'm not a movie buff. I'm not a fan of Hollywood stuff. I'm a fan of truth and I'm a fan of telling it like it is. I like action movies, but I don't like action movies where I have to sit back and watch a bunch of people running around the woods like the last few Rambo movies.

 I saw this film at the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles when it was first released in the late 60s. I was shocked that so many of the audience members were under the age of eighteen! The story line is not very original, but it is the music that makes it so enjoyable. The script is not very good though, and I'm not sure if it was because of the limited budget. Overall, I think that part of the reason that the film was so popular was because of the excellent cast. I remember every line of dialogue that was said, and every character's name and appearance. I wish I had a copy of the soundtrack, but unfortunately I don't. The movie is basically about a little boy (who is played by Michael Landon) who is abandoned at a railroad crossing and ends up having to walk to a distant town. Along the way he befriends a mysterious old man, or rather a witch (Hank Worden) who is on a mission to kill the boy's mother (Barbara Parkins). I was always fascinated with the idea of witches, and as a child I used to read many stories about such creatures. I believe that I may have been influenced by the fact that this film was directed
 This is one of my favorite films. I loved it since the first time I saw it and I'm still in love with it. I just saw it again and I fell in love with it all over again. It's so funny, so heartwarming and so cute, it's just perfect. It's a film that you'll always remember. It's a film about friendship and it's about being yourself. But also about not being scared about what other people think about you. It's about being different, being special and being who you are. It's about knowing that you're different from everyone else and that you are special to everyone. It's about knowing that you don't have to change to be accepted. It's about knowing what you want to be and finding the way to do it. It's about knowing that you can do anything, no matter what anybody says about you. It's about knowing that it's okay to be different, to be different and to be you.<br /><br />I love this film so much. It's like a gift to me. This film is unique, it's different and it's special. It's a film that you have to see. It's a film that I
 I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I've never been a fan of the "exploitation" genre, but I found many of the fashions and scenes to be interesting and entertaining. I was also surprised at how many of the actors had no previous acting experience. It's hard to imagine that such a movie was made without having a studio behind it. The picture quality is decent, although the sound is a little distorted through the headphones. If you like the fashions and the thriller genre, you'll enjoy this film.

Just as the title says, this film is a classic "exploitation" movie. I am a big fan of this genre, and found the film to be entertaining. The cast is good, and the story is original. The dialogue is a bit forced, but it's not bad. Definitely worth watching.

 I really liked this movie. It was one of the few I saw in the theater. At first it seemed like it would be another "save the whales" movie, but as it went on, I realized that it was a more subtle movie. It was a story about a young girl who needed to learn to stand up for herself and that she had to start acting like a person instead of a child.<br /><br />It was also a movie about girls and the way they can be so cruel to one another, but if they are taught the right way, they can be wonderful friends. It was also a great movie about friendship and how important it is. It was about a group of friends who were like sisters, and it was about how important it was to have friends, and that it is not always about having the best friend. It was also about how at any age, you can have your best friend, and you can have your worst enemy. It was a very emotional movie.<br /><br />I would totally recommend this movie. I loved the acting, and the soundtrack was great. I thought the movie was very smart, and I thought it was very touching.

 This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Sharon Stone plays a woman who is a real piece of work. She's a housewife who is so obsessed with her life being boring and mundane that she has to go out of the way to find excitement. A small part is this is the main reason why she has the affair with a married man. Stone plays her character like a real woman. She isn't a typical leading lady. She doesn't have a lot of screen time but what she does have is so believable and so good that it makes you want to be like her. At the end of the day Stone plays her character like it is real life. She is a woman who has no real purpose. She has no career. Her husband has no career. She has no friends. She is so boring that you want to tell her to wake up and start living. She is a woman who is so sick of her life that she has to make it up. This is the kind of movie that you don't want to see. I watched the movie in one sitting. I didn't want to move from the couch. I wanted to be Sharon Stone. She is a very compelling character. She is the
 This is a very good movie. It is based on a true story and is about a young man who was in prison for a crime he did not commit. It is about how he changed his life and became a good man and how he helped others who were also unjustly in prison. This movie has a very good cast and is an excellent story. A movie like this is a must see.

I saw this movie in the theater here in Virginia. I have to say that the acting is excellent, especially the
 This story, the first in the series, is the one that most people remember from the opening credits. And that is a shame, because it is the weakest of the whole series. That is not to say that it is bad, but the story is so much more powerful in the next two movies. <br /><br />This movie is about a high school teacher who is having an affair with his student. He is a married man with a son, but he is having an affair with a young girl. The story is a little predictable, but the acting is good and the film is interesting. It is not great, but it is good. <br /><br />In the next movie we pick up with our teacher and the girl who he is having an affair with. She is now a young woman and he is having an affair with her mother. It is a little different, but still very interesting. This is where the second film, "The Last Seduction" is much better. <br /><br />This movie is a bit of a dark fairy tale. It is a little strange and it is not really a horror movie, but it is a very interesting film. It is a little creepy, but it
 I haven't read the book. But I've seen the movie. I was really impressed with the film. It's really well made. I really liked the story. The story is about a girl who lives in a world with complete anarchy. The whole world is separated into three groups. Each group has a king and a queen. The leaders of the people are very strong and they always fight each other. But they never kill each other. The main character of the story is named Katniss Everdeen. She lives in the group of the people who want to kill the leaders of the other groups. She was given a job to do in a competition called The Hunger Games. The others in her group will fight to the death. The winner of the Hunger Games will be the winner of the whole world. The story is about Katniss, who has to fight for her life. She's the only one who's going to survive because the other groups don't know about her.

I really liked the special effects in the movie. I liked the music and the story. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action films.

8/10

P.S. The movie is based on the book.
 It is only fair to state that this is a very poor film. It was shot in a very basic way with poor lighting. The acting is extremely poor and the script is non-existent. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that I kept thinking to myself that I enjoyed the suspense of waiting to see who lives and who dies. I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
 I saw this movie on TV, and i thought it was a pretty good movie. I thought the acting was good, and the movie was very funny. If you can't find it for rent, maybe you can buy it for 25.00 a pop. I would rent it. It's worth that. I would recommend it to others. I agree with what the other reviewer said about it being a very good movie. I also agree on the subject of the movie being about a guy who falls in love with a co-worker, and he ends up sleeping with her sister, and we get to see a little bit more of his character. I for one like that kind of movie. I think the people who write comments on here are wrong about the movie being a sappy movie. It's not. It's not a bad movie. It's no The Notebook. It's a good movie. If you are looking for something to take you away from reality, this movie will do it. I recommend it.

I love this movie, i have seen it so many times. I have seen it with my best friends, my boyfriend
 I have a fondness for period dramas and I really enjoyed this one. It's a little more political than I have seen in movies but it's certainly not as heavy handed as many of the others. It's not a political movie per se, but it is a period drama, and I love them. I suppose it is too easily compared to the great period dramas of the 60's and 70's (I'm thinking of the great ones like "The Robe" and "A Man for All Seasons") but it is certainly worth seeing. I found it a little slow in the first part of the movie, but by the end it picked up, and it ended with a wonderful surprise. A very good movie, I recommend it to all of my friends. The DVD was full screen, and I think that might have been a bit of a mistake, but it was certainly very watchable.

7/10

I have to say that I really love the whole black tie, white tie scene. It's a very old fashioned thing, and I have always found it very charming.

 This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, despite the fact that I got sick after watching it, because it was too intense. I didn't know what was happening to the characters, nor why, but it made you care about them, and their plight. It's an excellent movie, and deserves further recognition than it has gotten so far. I recommend it whole-heartedly, and believe it will be a classic in the make.<br /><br />And later... I have watched the film several times since I discovered it, and it is even better each time I see it, because of the fact that I know what is going to happen next. If you are not a fan of horror movies, don't watch this one, because it is not for everyone. But if you are a fan of horror movies, and you haven't seen it yet, then you must!

Totally great movie. Its a bit slow in the beginning, but it gives you a great view of the main character. After a while
 In this film, we find a picture of this world that is not so different from that of the one in which we live. A mere glance shows us that there is indeed a world where everything is just as we see it, down to the smallest detail. This world is not the home of an alien race or a new species of human. It is our own.<br /><br />This is a film about people whose lives are filled with violence, corruption and greed. The man who is at the center of this story, Okamoto, is not a very original character. We find him in the movies a lot, and we can easily imagine that in most of them he will be the typical antihero. But what makes Okamoto different from the rest is that he is also a man who can be extremely sympathetic. His poor upbringing and his poor luck have helped to make him what he is. Still, it is not enough to make him a typical antihero. There are many films where the main characters are less likable than Okamoto, but the audience is still able to feel their empathy. Because they see them as they see us, as we are. The audience is able to see what we have seen. That is why
 I first saw this movie in a theater with a bunch of fellow film-goers. It was a good movie to see in a theater. It was also a good movie to see on television. That was the first time the movie was broadcast. I, like everyone else, was captivated by the film. It was a big surprise for me, as I had never seen it before. Now it has been repeated several times.

I don't know why this film is so popular, but a lot of people enjoy seeing it. I suppose it's because of the great acting, the interesting story, and the fact that the movie is just a simple story. It's a nice change from all the Hollywood crap we all have to sit through.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good, simple story. It's a nice, clean movie to watch.

 I saw the film, and thought it was the best film I had seen all year. I found the acting and the script very, very convincing. I felt that I was sitting in the cinema with these people, and I had a good laugh at the situations that were created. This film also made me want to see the original movie, and I am glad to say that I have now done so. I am hoping that the sequel is as good as the original.

The scenes are very convincing and the dialogue is witty. However, the script is not perfect and a few scenes could have been handled better. I wish there was a conclusion to the film, as I would have liked to know what happened to the characters after the film ended. This is a minor criticism, however, and should not affect the viewer's impression of the film.

Possibly the best film of the year.

The movie is a bit slow to start, but it picks up. It is about a man who is on vacation and he finds a package in a hotel. When he opened it up he found a dead body, and he tries to figure out who it is. This movie is very good and I will be watching this movie again.

 I happened to be walking past a video store and this caught my eye. I've seen many of the "experiments" that the government has done in the past, and although some of them were quite scary, this one was actually quite funny. I mean, how many times have you heard someone say that the government is trying to make us all into the same? It's not a new idea, but it is interesting to watch the government try to take the next step and make us all the same. It's definitely not as funny as the "South Park" episode, but it's still a funny film.

(While you're at it, see the movie "The Incredibles" I think it's the second best animated film ever made. From the animation, to the voice acting to the soundtrack, it's just a damn good movie.)

"The Man" is rated G in the US, and PG in the UK.

 I'm no expert on the subject, but I do know this movie is a fantastic piece of work, and I must say, the ending was a little weak, and a little rushed, but the entire movie was just so good and so authentic. I think that this was the best movie about the Vietnam War that I have ever seen. It was a real eye opener for me, and I'm glad that I saw this movie, because it really made me think about the war in a new way. The acting was absolutely perfect, and I loved the music in this movie. Some of the best music that I've heard in awhile. I felt really connected with the characters and I really felt like I was there, in the jungles of Vietnam. The movie was also a pretty realistic portrayal of the war, and you could see the fear, anger and frustration that the soldiers felt. I'm just hoping that this movie isn't going to be forgotten about, because it was a real gem of a movie, and it deserves more credit than it's getting. I hope that this movie will get recognized for the great, and real piece of work that it is. I can't wait to see what this movie is going to be like on DVD
 This is an amazingly powerful film. It's obviously a documentary because the title card says so, but it's so much more than that. The documentation of the events is remarkable in how much it brings the viewer into the feelings of the participants. The film is very raw and emotional and is a very powerful experience.<br /><br />In the end this film is about the power of human beings to live together, to love and to work together. It's about the strength of the human spirit. It's about the beauty of the human spirit. It's about the human spirit. It's about the human spirit.<br /><br />One of the most powerful scenes for me was when the participants then, in the year 2000, talked about what had happened to them, and how their lives had changed in the years since. This was a cinematic experience that I have never had before. It was so moving and so emotionally powerful that it was an experience that I will never forget.<br /><br />It's not a movie that you watch, it's a movie that you experience. It's not a movie that you forget, it's a movie that you carry with you forever.

 I absolutely love this film. It's a perfect mix of humor and horror. It's a lot of fun to watch and isn't scary, unless you're a complete slob.

I think they all fit perfectly. My favorite scene is when they are all trapped in the shower. I've seen this movie many times and I still laugh every time.

 This is the first of the new "Superhero" movies in years. I was a huge fan of the first two "Spiderman" movies, and this one does not disappoint! There are some mind-blowing special effects and great fight scenes, but there's something about the movie that is lacking. I don't know what it is, but I just couldn't get into the main character. It's like he's got a chip on his shoulder because he doesn't have superpowers and doesn't want to be labeled "The Spiderman." I'm not sure if I would like to see another movie based on this character because I don't think he is as interesting as the other two Spidermans.

 I was lucky enough to get to see this film at a local art festival in a theater in Los Angeles. (I believe it was the Santa Monica festival.) This movie was excellent. I saw it with a friend of mine, who has a young son, and we all cried during the last 20 minutes of the film. I had never seen so many interviews and clips of the real Jack. I am not a parent, but I believe this film would be incredible for parents to see with their children. It shows the real Jack, and the real kids. The movie does not pull punches, and does not sugar coat it. It is not a documentary, but it is a true story, based on the real Jack. The music is great, and the acting is stellar. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. It is an amazing movie that I would have loved to have seen when I was a young teen. It made me realize what I have lost, and what I have gained. This is a must see!

 It's an honest portrayal of a man just before his death. The end of his life is represented in a very raw and simple way. It's a true testament to the human spirit. It's a tribute to the human spirit. It's a testimony of a man who was just barely hanging on to life, but who was determined to live. This is a man who fought the fight to the end, but he died in the process. It's a story of a man who's a father, and it's a story of the father he'll be. It's a story of a man who will never be the same, but he's determined to be the best he can be. It's a story of a man who's a teacher, and it's a story of the teacher he'll be. It's a story of a man who's a brother, and it's a story of the brother he'll be. It's a story of a man who's a son, and it's a story of the son he'll be. It's a story of a man who's a friend, and it's a story of the friend he'll be. It's a story of a man who's a husband, and it's
 This is a great film, very well acted and well written. Its a very personal film, its based on true events. Its a very warm film and it made me laugh and cry at the same time. Its a wonderful film, and I would highly recommend it.

 I've read the book and seen the movie. I was surprised that the movie was almost a word for word copy of the book. Almost. The movie did change a few of the characters and cut in some things that were not in the book. That's fine, but I felt the movie was a bit more entertaining than the book. I found the movie to be more entertaining with the characters and situations. Also, the movie was not long enough to take in everything. You were constantly left waiting for something that wasn't there. The movie also did not show the main character's journey at all well. All in all, the movie was an ok adaptation of the book. It was a good movie, but I feel it could have been better.

 What a wonderful movie! I have seen it a couple of times, and I still enjoy it. I understand why it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, it is that good. It is a movie that makes you realize that life is worth living, and that love is more important than anything else. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves the movie "An Officer and a Gentleman" and who wants to see something different. I am an adult, and I really enjoyed the movie.

 This is a brilliant film. I saw it for the first time at age eleven, and I'm twenty now. The film is at once both crude and sophisticated, and it's full of bizarre and wonderful imagery. The casting is amazing. An early standout is the short, blonde, sarcastic, and unforgettably perfect Anne-Marie Miagian. She's an easy queen to fall in love with. The film also stars Anne-Marie's husband, Paul Reubens, who has never been better. He's hilarious, but not in a typical slapstick fashion. He's manic, and it's a joy to watch him try to control his character, which he does with aplomb. He's a genius, and this is his best work. The supporting cast is amazing. You might remember Mark Hamill as the Joker, but he was also the voice of The Tick. He's the best Joker in any incarnation. He's also the only Joker who actually seems to care about his job. I also liked John Glover, the director, who was also a major player in the cast. He's not a great actor, but he's a great director. Other actors who I found to be memorable, but don't
 This is a good movie, about the struggle of a young woman who is trying to make a name for herself in a world that does not think she has a place. She wants to be a writer, and so at the beginning of the movie her main goal is to find out how to become a writer. And so she manages to get a job as a secretary to a famous writer who has a horrible reputation. The best way she thinks to get him to like her is to work on his novel and make it better. But how can she do this? That is where the movie becomes interesting, because she finds out a way to get her name known, and that is to write a book of her own. She starts the book, but then she is fired by the famous writer, because he does not like her. He says that she is too smart for him, and that he likes her less now that he knows that she is smart. But I think that the movie is too good to be true, because I can't believe that he would fire someone just because they were smart. I think that this movie is trying to say that there is not a place for smart people in this world so they are not seen as good people, which
 How could anyone not love this movie? It is simply beautiful. The music is beautiful. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is beautiful. I just can't get enough of it! I saw this movie in the theatre and it still makes me cry. I watch it often and it always makes me cry. This is a beautiful movie and it is worth every penny. I have watched it with several people and they have all agreed that it is a wonderful classic. This movie is so touching, it is just so beautiful. I love this movie. I will buy this movie on DVD and I will watch it over and over again. This movie is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I love this movie and I am going to buy the DVD. I have already started to watch it. I love this movie so much. I can't imagine anybody not liking this movie. I love this movie so much. I also love the actress who plays Grandma. She is so beautiful. She is so beautiful and she is so kind. She is my favorite actress of all time. This is such a wonderful movie. I just love this movie so much. This is such a beautiful, wonderful movie. I love this movie
 I watched this film just a couple of months ago and it was not too long ago that I watched another of Bogdanovich's films, The Last Picture Show, which is one of the best films I've ever seen.<br /><br />I can't really say anything about the plot of this film, because I was too busy staring at Robert Mitchum, who was a great actor but I had never seen him in a film before this. The first thing I noticed about him was that he was so incredibly hot! I mean, he has a little limp and shuffles around a little and he looks like a typical old man, but then he starts to get dressed and you can see that he is perfectly built and looks like he could have been a bodybuilder in his younger days.<br /><br />The film is about Mitchum and someone else who goes to a motel in a desert town to get away from the world and the people in it. They go to the motel and we get to see a lot of naked women and we see a lot of sex and it is all very tasteful. There are only a couple of scenes that are slightly more than tasteful and it is slightly uncomfortable for the viewer, but it
 This is a pretty good movie. It has some pretty interesting plot twists. I like how this movie is more about the characters, than about the plot. The main characters are very likeable, and you can't help but root for them.<br /><br />The only problem is, this movie is not very good. There are a lot of things that could have been fixed, but were not. But, this movie is better than most movies I have seen.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good movie, but not great.

The Movie Is Great, The DVD Is Terrible

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I loved this movie. It was fresh, interesting, and had great performances. I would give it a 7 out of 10. If you like independent films, this is a must see. The DVD is awful though. It doesn't have any extras or anything, just the movie and a trailer. I have no idea why it's so bad. It's like they
 This is a great little movie. I love the concept of the movie, which is to make a movie in the style of the TV series MASH. I thought the movie was well done and I enjoyed the flick. The cast is great, and the director did a good job with directing and having a good script. I thought the movie was well paced, and kept my attention and kept me interested. The end of the movie was very fun and very entertaining. The movie is a little long for my liking, but it didn't bother me too much. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see MASH style movies. This movie is worth watching.

7/10

Disappointed

****

I was looking forward to seeing this movie since it was based off of a TV series that I love, MASH. However I was a little disappointed. The movie appears to be too long and seems to drag a bit. There was a lot of character development in the movie which I felt was unnecessary. The movie would have been much better if it was just focused on the main characters and what they were doing in the movie. I think the movie could have been better if they just focused on the main characters
 This movie is about a young woman who lives in love with her sexuality and her relationship with her friends. She has a strong sense of self, wants to experiment with different men and have fun with them. She is a sexual person and she enjoys it, though she is always careful with whom she chooses to be with. She's not a slut or a prude, and she doesn't care what other people think about her. She is a very intelligent and sensitive person. She is not shallow, but she is not very experienced in the ways of the world. She is a virgin, and she never had sex before. I would say it is a very realistic depiction of a young woman's life in the present time. She is so open and confident, and she is so sure of herself. She is not a prude, and she is not a slut, although she has some experiences with other people, but she is not very experienced or experienced at all. I thought this movie was very good. It was very realistic and honest. It's a feel good movie with a great cast.<br /><br />The characters were very well developed. The main character is a very smart, sensitive person. She doesn't take herself too seriously
 This is not a great film, but it's a decent one. It's not a great film because it's not a great movie, it's a decent one because it's not a great movie. It's a decent one because it's not a great movie...<br /><br />This is a film about a young girl who's mother is killed in a car accident, and she's sent to live with her father and his new wife(who's a bitch). She's left with her father and his new wife, but she's also left with a lot of questions, which she seeks to answer with the help of a psychic who says he's a "very important person". He says he can help her get information about her mother, and she agrees. She goes to his house, and he tells her she's in danger, and he tells her she needs to leave, and he gives her a key to a place where she can go, and told her to go there. She goes there, and she meets a psychic, who's name is Alex, but he says his name is Jack, and he says he's an important person, and he tells her she's in danger, and to leave, and he gives
 For the most part, I rate "L'Espion qui rit" with a 6. I like the movie, but it has its flaws. The best scenes are the ones that actually have a plot. In most of the movie, it's just a series of random situations, which all seem to be related, but in the end, nothing really happens, and the movie ends up being a big pile of nothing. I would have to say that the movie is at its best when it is being funny. When I was watching this movie, I was laughing out loud a few times, and that basically makes this a good movie. I am also glad that this movie is in French, because it would have been very hard to have a good English dub for this movie. I hope that I can find it on the internet soon, so I can watch it again, and so I can see what I missed the first time.

 This is a film for people who want to be entertained but not scared. It is about a guy who discovers that he has a talent for reading minds and he is offered a job to read people's minds to help people solve their problems. He ends up meeting a woman who has a lot of problems which include the death of her parents, a rape and a murder. He helps the woman solve the problems but he has to find out who the killer is and why they are killing all the people. It is a fun film which is not too scary. It is a good film for a date night or a night in with the kids. This is a film for a movie night.

 This was one of my favorite movies this year. I don't really want to really dwell on the "plot" of the movie, but rather I want to point out the great acting by the supporting cast. Ted Danson, who has been in a lot of movies, usually for comedy, but in this one he is the straight man, the one who is in charge of the crew and who stands up for the "truth", even if it means alienating the rest of the crew. He is very good in this role, and it is a shame that he has a tendency to mumble a lot of the time. I don't think that detracts from his performance. The rest of the cast, especially the main "bad guy", is also very good. I don't want to give anything away, but if you are a fan of the original, you will absolutely love this one, it is not even close to being a remake.

 A great recent addition to the horror genre and one of the few good low budget horror films in a long time. It has a nice balance of good acting, great effects and a good story. This is a story of a young woman (the "It Girl") who is tormented by a man in a blonde wig and a white suit. She is stalked and murdered by a ghost (the "Man in the White Suit").<br /><br />While it's not perfect, the good far outweighs any of the few flaws. The camera work is very good and the locations are excellent. There are some scenes where the camera pans over a pool of water and shows only what is under the water. It's a very good effect. The film is also very good at drawing you in. I was still very interested in the story when the movie ended. I liked all the characters, even the "bad guys". <br /><br />The cast is very good, including the original "It Girl" and the "Man in the White Suit". The two main actors were very good. The rest of the cast was also good, including the two female leads. The "Man in the White Suit" was done very well
 I rented this movie just for the sake of watching it, and to see if it was any good. I am so glad I did. I came home from work and my husband said, "I have a surprise for you!" It was this movie. I had no idea what it was about, so I was kind of anxious. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is about a young girl who has a very difficult time getting over the death of her father. She keeps an arrow that was shot into his heart as a keepsake, and she does a lot of research to try to find out her father's story. She finds out that he was a soldier, and he died in combat. She also finds out that he was one of a few people who was given the ability to see the future. It was a sad story, and it was a very good movie. I thought it was well done, and I loved the ending. I think this movie is definitely worth a rental.

1.0 out of 5 stars Funny-Cute, but a little bit of a letdown. Format: DVD This movie was absolutely adorable. I rented it for my three year old and we absolutely loved it. The
 I admit it, I am a huge fan of the TV show, "The X-Files". I am also a huge fan of horror (and of The X-Files, of course). So when I learned that the first episode of the series was being released on DVD, I was very excited. I was especially excited when I learned that it would be the first episode of the first season of the series. I had read in one of the reviews that the episode was better than the show itself, and I am not exaggerating. I thought the episode was great, a good start to a great series. I have since watched the entire series and I have to say that this episode is still the best of the series, in my opinion. This is not to say that the rest of the series is bad though, because it is not. It just doesn't have the same quality as this episode has.<br /><br />So, what is this episode about? Well, the episode opens with Mulder and Scully going to a crime scene. They are looking for evidence of a serial killer. Mulder is convinced that the murderer is a government agent and that the government is using him to kill. Scully, however, has her doubts
 As a comic strip fan, I was thrilled to see that someone other than the creators of the original comic strip was making a movie about the exploits of this old-fashioned superhero. I was also thrilled to see that the movie was actually BETTER than I had hoped for. Sure, the movie didn't have the same heart as the original comic strip, but it was a lot of fun to watch, and it was a great way to spend a summer afternoon. If you're a fan of the original comic strip, and you don't mind a little camp, then my guess is that you'll really enjoy this movie.

(And I should mention that the movie is based on Pogo, not the original comic strip. So, if you're a fan of Pogo and you don't mind a little camp, then my guess is that you'll really enjoy this movie.)

(And, if you're a fan of Pogo, but you don't mind a little camp, then my guess is that you'll really enjoy this movie.)

Rated: PG-13

apparently this movie was not released in the states. My wife only recently watched it, so I've not seen it. I'm sure
 I saw this film in the cinema when it was first released in the UK. The film was a little bit longer than I thought but still well executed and enjoyable. By the time I saw it on video I realised that there were only three actors in the film. The director/writer, Jeff Bridges, the lead actor, Paul Henreid and the male lead, Melvyn Douglas. The story was interesting and well told. The only thing I really disliked about the film was the use of dubbing. It seemed a bit odd and out of place. I would give this film a 7 out of 10.

 I read a review of this film in the cinema magazine "Sight & Sound" and was immediately attracted to it. I live in Croatia, in a small town called Vukovar. It was a sad day for us when this film was shown at the local cinema in April 2003. In the film, a group of people was taken out of their homes by the besieging Yugoslav forces. The siege of Vukovar lasted from November 1991 to February 1992. I had just been through a war myself, the one in Croatia in 1991. The film was very emotional. My wife and I saw the film twice during its first week of release in the cinema. (The film was also shown at home in Croatia.) I was very moved by the film. I was very proud of the Croatian people. I was very proud of the film. I wanted it to be shown in the cinema all over the world. I wanted it to be shown in the best theatres in Miami. I wanted it to be shown in my local cinema in Vukovar. Poor people in the film were killed by bullets and shells. They were surrounded and they were unable to escape. I thought of my own city, Vukovar, where
 I left the cinema that night with a kind of feeling that I had seen something special. The film is beautifully shot, the soundtrack is haunting and the acting is superb. I can only hope that the film does well, and that the director and the actors are able to maintain their careers.

The film is about a young woman who goes to Spain with her boyfriend to help him with a project. When there, she gets involved with a young Arab man who is also studying in the place. The film is based on fact, and the character of the woman who is at the centre of the film is based on a real person.

This is a film that must be seen.

It's a shame that this film has to be about the love of a terrorist for a young woman. It's a shame that it has to be about the love of a terrorist for a young woman. It's a shame that it has to be about the love of a terrorist for a young woman.

I saw this movie on the video and it is so funny. You can't help but laugh. They are always making fun of the famous people in the news and the small town people. I think that this movie is so funny. I have watched it over and over again. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh.

I saw this movie on the video and
 The film stars John Gielgud as a retired theatre critic who is slowly slipping into dementia. He starts to interact with an old friend (George C. Scott) who is also suffering from the same affliction. They talk about the past and play games of memory. <br /><br />The film is intelligent, funny and poignant. Gielgud and Scott are great together and the film is very well made. I highly recommend it.

10/10

4.0 out of 5 stars A bittersweet comedy of fading memories TOP 500 REVIEWER Format: DVD This is a film with a sting in its tail. The ending is not a happy one. It is a film where you are made to feel very sorry for the main actor who is played by John Gielgud. He plays an old man who is slowly going mad. He has a long conversation with George C. Scott who is also suffering from the same affliction. The film is witty, intelligent and makes you laugh but it also makes you think. It is a situation you encounter in real life. You see people who have lost the ability to do simple everyday things such as locking doors, remembering people's names and so on.
 I saw "The Killer Angels" on TV a few weeks ago and I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. The acting, the story, the music, everything was sublime. I couldn't wait to see it again. I had to wait 10 years before I could buy it. Needless to say, I loved it all over again.<br /><br />While I love the story of the movie, I have to say that the acting is amazing. I have heard some people say that we don't see enough of the men who fought in the war. Well, I believe that this movie shows us how some of these men felt. All we see in the movie is the end result. The men were so scared of losing their lives and they were so determined to win, that they would do anything they could to win. For example, one of the men, John Heffernan (Robert Duvall) is in the middle of a battle. He gets shot and he is dying. He says, "I'm going to die. I've just got to get up and do something." He does. He gets up and he kills a Confederate. He dies a hero. He didn't have to die
 We all know that the movie business is all about the money, but who knew that there was a giant conspiracy to keep this movie from being released. I was thrilled when I got the chance to see this movie on the big screen, after all, I had never heard of it, and it wasn't shown in a theater, it was just available on video, and I am all about seeing movies on the big screen, as I have said before. The movie is about a group of people that are trying to squeeze in a little fun in the middle of their day to day work. They hold a celebration for someone named James, and the movie is about how they try to get by without getting caught by their supervisors, and how they try to get their lives back on track. The movie starts off with a great scene in which we see some of the characters hanging out, and then the next scene we see the characters working hard at their jobs, and trying to get by, and of course, the rest of the movie is about the characters trying to stay at work, or trying to sneak out of the office to get some fun in the middle of their work day. The movie is all about the characters trying to work their jobs, but
 HOLIDAY INN is a great little film. It's an oldie, but a goodie. The screenplay was by Ernest Lehman, who would go on to write the musical ONCE ON THIS ISLAND and the underrated THE SOUND OF FURY. The story revolves around "The Snobs," the rich and famous, who come to Connecticut to play golf. They run into a couple of young people, who are trying to "start over." Pretty soon, the relationship between the two young people is revealed, and you have a very interesting story. This film stars the great Paul Newman, and the beautiful Julie Andrews. It's one of those films that you keep thinking about after you've seen it. I can't say I've seen it in a long time, but I still remember the characters and their relationships very well. It's really a very good film. I don't think it would play now, because it's a little dated, but it's a great little film. I love it.

(Note: The picture quality on this disc is excellent, as are the audio and video quality.)

 i've never been a fan of the Bourne movies, the books and the TV show, but this movie is fantastic. it is well-written, well acted, and well directed. it has a nice pace to it, and the action scenes are terrific. Jason Bourne is a good character, and the film is well-cast. it's not real spy stuff, but it's not bad either. i am a fan of the book, but i didn't care for the novelization of this movie. i think they did a decent job with it. i'm not a Bourne fan, but i thought the movie was fun, and i enjoyed it. the Bourne movies have a lot of action and Bourne is a pretty good fight guy.

4.0 out of 5 stars Better than expected I was expecting to be extremely disappointed by the Bourne movies but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is better than the books and the movie Bourne is a good guy. The action is quite a bit better than the Bourne books. I liked the movie and I would recommend it to others. It's a fun movie to watch.

3.0 out of 5 stars Still worth seeing I'm a big
 This movie is a great mixture of horror, drama and comedy. It's a movie that is entertaining from beginning to end. The acting is not the best, but it's good.<br /><br />As for the plot it's about a couple who have just moved into a house on a quiet street which is really nice. There are no neighbors. Then after a few days, a mysterious hand appears in the window. The girl sees the hand, but has no idea what it is. The boy does not see anything. Then one day the hand comes into the kitchen and the girl sees it again. It's up to the boy to make her understand what it is. It's a story about what might happen to them if they see it again.<br /><br />It's a short movie, but it's very entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. It has some great effects and it's a short movie. It's a good place to start if you've never seen a horror movie before.

 I had to sit through this movie in a theater just to get it over with. It was maybe the most boring film I've ever seen. I was annoyed that I had to pay money to sit there and watch something so boring. I can't believe a director would have his name on such a piece of crap. It's a shame to waste good actors' time on this movie. The best part of the movie was when they did the dance. That only happened when something was happening. The only good thing that came out of this movie was the dance of course. I would recommend it to people who've got too many hours to kill on a boring day. I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again.

my rating = 5

I just saw this movie at the theater, and it was really good. It was really funny, and really summed up a lot of the things I have been thinking about lately. It was a bit sappy, but I enjoy that kind of thing. So, if you like that kind of thing, go see this movie.

I can't believe they only made this movie because of the actors in it. They
 The story of a wealthy family living in a mansion in the woods has become a familiar one. In the case of "House of Usher", it is the Gothic structure of the house itself which is the source of the family's problems. In the case of this film, the universal themes of love, loss of love, madness, death, insanity and loneliness are all conveyed with a great deal of subtlety and intelligence. <br /><br />It is not a film that falls into the category of a "creepy" horror film. There are no jump scares and no gore. We see very little of the house, and when we do, it is only brief glimpses into the great rooms. The film is very matter-of-fact and matter-of-factly approaches its subject matter. This lends a great deal of credibility to the story. It is not an overly sentimental film, nor is it an overly intellectual film. It simply tells its tale in an elegant and sophisticated manner. This is not a film that is going to appeal to the masses. It is a film that is going to appeal to the literate and well-educated.

 This is a movie that I really enjoyed watching. The story line was very interesting. The characters in the movie were very well played and the actors did a great job.<br /><br />The movie takes place in modern times when a UFO landed in the middle of the desert. The government has no idea what to do. The government is afraid to tell the public cause they don't want the public to panic.

 In the early 1990's I was in the middle of a divorce. And, I was also a single mom. It was a very hard time for me. I took to re-watching old movies to distract me from my sorrow. And, I found this movie. I would watch entire episodes of The Golden Girls with my daughter. I would watch episodes over and over again. And, my daughter would watch too. This was one of her favorite series of all time. She would watch the episodes on video and then we would watch them together again. It was a great thing to do. This is a great series. It is both funny and sentimental. I love the way the women are portrayed. They are all very unique. Each has a distinct personality and they all get along well with one another. I think this is a one of a kind show. And, I think it is one of the better ones. It is one of the best-written and best acted shows I have ever seen. It is a very funny show. The actors are very good and the actresses are great. I think comedy is very important in life. And, I think that this series is one of the best I have ever seen. I would recommend it
 I remember seeing this at the local video rental place as a kid and have always been curious as to what it was about.

As he and his family start to build it, they realize that something is out there in the woods. They start to see strange creatures and things that they don't understand.

 This movie was really really good. I was really really surprised with the movie. The story was really good and the acting was great. Not like a lot of movies that had bad acting. The story was based on a true story. If you like drama then you will love this movie. I think that this movie should be more known to the public. It was in a movie theater near where I live and I was really surprised to see this movie. I was looking at the movie because I didn't know what it was about. I wasn't expecting a movie with drama, but I really really like it. I really really liked it. I think that other movies should be like this one. I would like to see more movies like this one. And I would like to see more movies based on true stories. If you like drama and you like movies that are based on true stories then this movie is for you. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. And I think that other people should see this movie because it is a good movie.

There was a lot of action and the plot was really good. I thought it was very interesting in that it was a movie about a little girl who could fly and a boy who could control the wind. I thought the actors did a very good job in this movie. The background music was great also. I found the sound effects and the storyline to be very interesting as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and adventure. I think that this movie was definitely a good movie and I give it a 10 out of 10.

To start off with, this movie was very entertaining.
 This is a great film. I liked it when I first saw it at one of the AMC theaters in my town(I think it was the Loews or the AMC Boston Common). I have since seen this movie probably 10 times. It is one of my favs. The best thing about it is that it is not a typical "chick flick" movie. It is a good movie for guys to see with the girls and vice versa. I think that is what we like about it. It is not your typical romantic comedy. It has action and adventure, and great humor. It has a movie feeling to it. It just makes you feel good. And I think that is why it is a great movie to see. It is fun. It has some pretty cool characters. It is one of those movies you can pick up and watch and really enjoy. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I know that I am a fan of it. I think that is why I like it. It is just a good movie to watch.

 One of the best episodes of the original series. It's when the guys are in the future and see what life is like after the war. Now if only we'd get another episode with this cast, I would be happy. And I'm one of the few who would vote for this show to be revived. It has great characters, great writing, and is a very funny show. This episode is a close second or third to "The Trouble With Tribbles".

 This film was so great. I saw it on TV when it first came out; it was on primetime on NBC. I was a young kid then, and I didn't know what it was about. I couldn't understand a word. When I saw it again, I knew what it was about. I also saw it on DVD, so I knew what to expect. I absolutely loved the movie. I was eleven when I saw it, and I'm fifteen now. I loved the film. I loved how they had the fight scenes. They were so realistic. I also loved the part when they were at the mall. That's one of my favorite scenes in the film. I love how they had the game. I loved the theme song. The song, "The Power of Love," was so great. I also love how they showed the other side of the city. The part when they were fighting in the city, it was so cool. I love the movie. I love the way it was filmed and all. I love how it has the real feel of it. It was great. I love all the characters in the film. I loved the way they did the fight scenes. I loved the way they did the fight
 I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in the early 90s and fell in love with it. The songs were so beautiful. I had the CD with me and listened to it every day for a week. The story was so sad and touching. I cried every time I heard the song "Somewhere Over the Rainbow". When I heard that this movie was coming out on DVD, I bought the first one and could not wait to get the second. But I was so disappointed that it was the same movie with the exact same songs! I got the second one too, and again, the same thing! I was so upset that I went back and bought the movie again just to make sure that it was a different movie. The second time around it was a different story and I was so happy. The only thing that I don't like about the DVD is that it has no subtitles. It would have been nice if they had subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing. Sometimes I can't understand what is being said because there are no subtitles. If they would have subtitles, I would give it 10 stars. I know this is a big movie and I would of loved to have subtitles, but I am so happy that
 The story of an American soldier who returns from WWII to his hometown in Germany and falls in love with a German girl would not have been the first story to go the screen. Sadly, most of the WW II films that were made didn't do justice to the actual events. "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" offers a refreshingly different view of the events that were taking place in Europe at the time. Screenwriter Allan Scott manages to focus not only on the romantic relationship between Frank and Alice but also on the harsh realities of life in the aftermath of the war. The film is more of a character study than a conventional love story, but it's written and directed with such sensitivity that it succeeds in its mission. The performances are also terrific and the film's attention to detail is remarkable for its time. Frank Sinatra is effortlessly charismatic as Frank and he's backed up by the always-wonderful Kim Novak as Alice. The film also features Billie Burke as Frank's mother, Mary and the always-wonderful Peter Lawford as the British Major. The film also features Paul Henreid, Robert Cummings, and Barbara Bel Geddes in small roles. There's also a very brief appearance by the
 This is a great movie, a great cast, great setting and an interesting story. The movie is based on the non fiction book Don't Tell My Mother by Robert Hughes, hence the title. The story follows a young woman named Alice (Natalie Portman) who goes to live with her father in Australia. The movie follows the years leading up to World War II. It is a very realistic portrayal of the people, the culture and the life of the time. It also shows that it was a time where people were very sympathetic to each other and the plight of the poor. The movie was very well done and the message was very clear--we have to have peace and cooperation with each other, not just for our own benefit, but for the benefit of all. The actors in this movie were all very good and did the movie justice. Some of them played 2 or 3 different roles and were able to convey the character's feelings and thoughts. Natalie Portman is one of the great actresses and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

Great film

Author: Ann from New Jersey

 I saw this movie in the cinema as an adolescent and was totally blown away. I was first impressed by the cinematography and the use of the multiple camera angles and the special effects of the super-computer that was a part of the story. I was impressed by the complex plot and the great way that the story developed. I have seen the movie many times in the decades since and it is still one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. The music was amazing and the story was complex and interesting to follow. I was captivated over and over again by the story.<br /><br />The story is about a computer program (which is really a computer virus) that takes over the world's computers and makes them all run it. The computer programs are in the form of a super-computer that dances and plays games and writes poetry. The computer is also a part of a social network which spreads the virus throughout the world. The music, the dancing, the poetry and the computer virus are just a part of the plot. The plot develops through the plot of the computer virus. It is well written with a complex plot and interesting characters. The plot develops in the most amazing way and I was completely drawn into the story.
 Music, dance and song. Bollywood at its best. The film is a simple story about a modern day Romeo and Juliet, who are unable to get together because of the color of their skin, but the end is a happy classic ending, with a twist. The story is told through the eyes of the main character's friend, who is the main love interest of the story. He is a typical Bollywood Hero, good looking, charming and the best dancer. The ending is the best part of the film and the best part of the movie. The acting is great, the song selection is great, the dance is great and the story is great. It's a great movie and I highly recommend it.

I've seen this movie twice now and I still can't get over it. The story is simple, but so is life. The movie brings together two people from different backgrounds, but their love for each other is stronger than anything else. I'm not noting any particular acting, as it's all superb, but I
 I really liked this movie. It is a very unique combination of the story of the Three Stooges, with the fantasy of a child's imagination. I thought it was very funny and off-the-wall, but still very entertaining. I have seen two other movies about the Three Stooges and I thought that this movie was better than both of them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, or to anyone who has never seen any Three Stooges movies.

<br /><br />I give this movie an 8/10.

 I think this movie is a little emotionally complex. I did see it at the tender age of 17, and have only recently seen it again after many years. I think the way it is presented, it is very easy to quickly forget that it is a documentary. It is a fictional movie, and that is not a bad thing. But when you look at the facts, a little differently, and see the movie for what it is, you are left with a movie that is more touching, and more exciting than you could have imagined. Movie starts out with a dog being beaten and ends with a man about to be executed. This movie is about the brutality of life, and what is the true nature of humanity. The acting is beyond reproach, and I think this is a good movie to watch.

 Dear God! I can't believe I've never seen this movie before! It's about a girl who loses everything and becomes a hooker for a few months to pay back all of her debts. This is a very powerful movie about a girl who is really confused. A movie that you won't find any stars in it but a great message and a great story. I don't really know what to say about it. It's just a great movie! I wish that there would be more movies like this. It's very powerful and it will definitely make you think about how you should live your life. I really enjoyed it and I hope to see more movies like this.

I just finished watching this movie, and it was very good. It's about a girl who has no money and is raped and left pregnant. She gets a job at a motel and she meets a nice guy who treats her like a princess
 A friend of mine had this on VHS and I borrowed it from him one evening. I was totally blown away. It was a totally new way of seeing the world. While I am not a religious person, I was nonetheless affected by this movie.<br /><br />In fact, I think it is a great movie that is worth watching over and over again. I think it has more to do with the way that we see the world. I know that in my life I have been the victim of prejudice and hate because of my religion. I can still remember the fear that I had when I was a child. We were forced to leave our home because of the religious fervor of the people who lived there. <br /><br />I can still remember the feeling of being afraid when I went to the beach. I remember the feeling of being afraid that someone would recognize me and tell my parents that I was a Christian. And then the fear of being called a "faggot" and not being able to defend myself. <br /><br />I know what it is like to be a minority. And I know what it is like to feel that you are the only one in your family or community who believes
 I must admit, I came to this movie expecting the worst. I had heard about it only because some of the critics said it was a bad movie and that nobody had liked it. I thought to myself, "Well, if I have to sit through a bad movie, then I might as well make it worth while." I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was a good movie! I know that everyone has their own opinion on movies and I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I thought it was a very good movie. I laughed, I cried, I screamed, and I enjoyed it. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good movies with a great story line. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

One more thing though, don't let the critics sway you. They are all looking for something to say and they say it by saying bad things about a movie. The movie is not for everyone, but it is for those who like it.

 I love sci-fi, but I don't watch it very often. I usually like the more serious kind of sci-fi, the kind that makes you think, even if you think it's just your usual science fiction. I saw this movie at the local movie theater, and I thought it was great. I loved it, and I think you will too. It's one of those movies that you can sit down and watch without even knowing what's going on. If you are looking for a good movie to watch over and over again, this is it. It's a very original story, and I think it's one that you'll never forget. It's a very good movie to watch. I don't know what else to say, except that I think you'll like it.

This is the story of a girl who is a "clone" of her mother who is abducted by aliens. Her father races to save her. The first half of the movie is a typical alien invasion movie
 This is a nice short film and it has some great actors in it. I like David Ogden Stiers, he is one of the few good actors out there. The plot is good and I like the way the film is shot. The plot is a little odd though, I wish there was more explanation of why the old woman did what she did. That is pretty much it. I think it is funny, I like the fact that she has a crab under her bed. The plot is not really that important, it is just funny. The plot is interesting, it is about a woman who is dying of cancer and seeks a way to live on after she dies, she has the idea to have a crab under the bed. I like the fact that there is a crab in the bed. The plot is not that important, but it is a nice plot. The plot is about a woman who has cancer and she seeks a way to live on after she dies.

 I watched many of these videos with my friends in high school, and we all unanimously agreed that "Grateful Dead" and the "Camelot" series were the best of the best, and this was the one of the most amazing examples of the "Camelot" series. Its a great example of how a group of talented people can take a fairly simple idea and create a masterpiece. "The Making of "Camelot" - The Musical" is a documentary-style documentary, and it is quite impressive. It is quite long, but I think that it is quite worth it. The footage of the actors and crew is rather short, so I would recommend the video if you want to see more of the "Camelot" series, or if you want to see the artistic process of creating a musical. The footage that is in the video is quite impressive, and it is quite interesting to see all of the work that goes into creating a musical.

 I loved this movie! I've seen the first half at a film festival in Montreal and really liked it. I've read a lot of the reviews here and haven't seen any that I agree with. I'm 18 and think it's a great movie to watch. I love the idea of being in the movie and trying to see through the eyes of the characters. I think that some think it's too much of a love story, but it's not, it's an interesting story. I do think that the movie should have been longer, I didn't really get what happened at the end, I don't think it was clear at all. I hope that this movie gets a chance to be released to the public, I think that more people would like it if they could see it.

 I am a big fan of this movie and I am shocked to see so many negative comments here. The movie is not that bad at all. Sure, the acting is not Shakespeare, but it's not exactly up to par with a movie like "The Godfather". The plot is interesting and the characters you get to know are interesting, too. Although I have seen the movie many times, I am still surprised how surprised I was by the ending of this movie. I often find myself thinking about what happened in the movie and the other times I watch the movie I just want to enjoy it and forget about it afterwards. A very good movie by the way.

 I have to say I'm glad I didn't give up on this movie, because it has turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm a huge fan of the first two movies, and I was worried that the third installment wouldn't be able to measure up. I was wrong. The movie really does a great job of tying up the loose ends of the first two movies, and gives it a nice, happy ending. I was also surprised that the movie was able to stay true to the first two movies. The movie was very similar in tone and plot to the first two movies, and it was great to see that they didn't stray too far from the original formula.<br /><br />As a side note, I also have to say that this movie was a great way to introduce people to the original two movies. I saw this movie when I was 11, and I had never watched the first two movies, so I was really confused at first. But once I got into the movie, it was great to see how well it tied everything together, and how everything really does lead back to the first two movies.

 "The Cat Returns" is a great movie to watch with a group of friends. The plot is very simple, but there's something about it that makes it fun to watch. The movie is a bit confusing at times, but the cast is great and they make up for the lack of plot. "The Cat Returns" is a fun movie, but it's also a great movie to watch when you want to feel like you're a kid again.

Somewhere in the city of Tokyo, three kids are wandering through the woods. A man with a horn is following them, but the kids don't know what he is. Then, the kids stumble upon a cat and try to take it home with them, but the cat turns out to be a magical creature and it becomes the guardian for the kids. The kids name the cat "Sasuke" and the cat becomes the guardian for the kids. The story is simple, but it's still fun to watch. The best part about "The Cat Returns" is the cast. The cast is made up of Tomokazu Seki
 In the beginning, it's a bit slow, but keep in mind, it was shot in the 60's. It is hard to imagine how bad it was when this was released. The movie takes place in the 1960's, which is that period between the end of the 50's and the beginning of the 70's. The movie is a very well done look at the 60's and the hippie movement. I'm not sure if it's because I'm from the 60's, but this film really struck me as if it was shot at a time not too much different from when it was filmed. The acting is also excellent! For a low budget movie, it is well done. The costumes are original and appropriate for the time period of the movie. The main cast is also very good. The main story line is about a small group of hippies that crash a party at a large hotel owned by a very wealthy family. It's a small party and the residents of the hotel are not happy to see the hippies at their party.<br /><br />The movie was shot in the 60's and so the costumes are really appropriate.

 I've seen this movie several times since it was released, and it never fails to make me laugh. I think that the plot is pretty good, and I like the actors in the movie. One character in the movie, a dog named Buster, is so funny that you'll constantly be cracking up. Michael Keaton is cool as the lead character, and the rest of the cast is pretty good, too. I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie, and I think that everyone should see it.

 I found this film very moving, and there are moments that are just so heartbreaking that you'll find yourself crying for hours. The opening scene is one of the most powerful I've ever seen. From there, the film just gets stronger and stronger, adding more and more heartbreaking moments to your heart. If you love movies about the Vietnam War, you'll definitely love this one. This is a film that you will not forget. The acting is superb (especially by those who were actually in the war, like the great Lou Diamond Phillips), the story is captivating, and it's a film that you could watch over and over again. I've seen it many times and never tire of it. One of the best movies I've ever seen. 10 out of 10.

 This movie is a masterpiece. It is the story of a man, who is crushed and beaten by his life, his marriage, his job and his health, who one day decides to do something about his misery. He puts his life into the hands of a complete stranger, and irrationally decides to kill him. In a true tale of "The Ride of the Valkyries" he goes to war. The movie is not a violent movie, but it is a very sad one, and it probably should be seen only by those who are interested in psychology and philosophy. The movie is not an easy one to watch, but it will stay with you for a long time.

Since this film was made in the early eighties, it is not very well known outside of the film-going community, but I can see why it is not very popular. It doesn't try to be a violent, action movie, and it is not a comedy either. It is a very philosophical movie, and it doesn't cover all the bases. I think it is a very good film, and I am very glad that I have seen it. I can see that it is a story that needs to be told, and I think that it
 I love this film. I love the way it paints a picture of the very interesting relationship between two young women and the very interesting people they are, who are also very interesting to watch. I love the way it creates a setting in which these two women can be themselves and not have to be anyone else. I love the way it creates a different type of situation in which people can be themselves and still be accepted. I love the way it shows (and I think teaches) that it is possible and even desirable to be sexually attracted to a woman without having to be sexually intimate with her. I love the way it shows that it is possible to have a beautiful and healthy relationship with the person you love without being physically intimate with that person. I love the way it shows that it is possible to be a free loving, sexually free, non-monogamous, relationship with a person you love. I love the way it shows that it is possible and desirable to love more than one person at a time. I love the way it shows the ways in which relationships can be unique, creative, intimate, and deeply fulfilling. I love the way it shows that a woman can be a man's lover and still be a woman.

 I found this movie to be very interesting and enjoyable. The plot was good and very suspenseful, and there were a lot of funny scenes. Also, when the main character gets hit on the head by a falling chair, and then after that, takes a nap, I found that to be very funny. I think the acting in this movie was a little bit strange, but it was fun to watch.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mystery movies, and I would give this movie a 7 out of 10.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I thought this movie was very interesting. I have never seen a movie like this before. The beginning was kind of boring and the acting was not that great, but after a while it got better. The plot was not very interesting, but I think it was good for a movie like this. I thought the ending was kind of weird, but I thought the movie was good overall. The movie was very suspenseful and I thought it was one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I think most people would enjoy this movie, and
 The best of the "Animaniacs" series (a collection of seemingly random episodes). Those looking for more of the same may be disappointed, but this is a surprisingly good episode. The plot is a bit thin and the jokes are totally random, but the kids are very funny and the animation is wonderful. It's also a nice change of pace from other "Animaniacs" episodes where the humor is not very good.

5.0 out of 5 stars Good Stuff!

This is a great episode, I wish it had been part of the series. A lot of the jokes are a bit too mature for a show like Animaniacs, but the kids are hilarious. Its also a pretty good example of how the show was made, it had a few mis-steps and some of the jokes were not very funny as a result. But overall its a solid episode, and I suggest checking it out.

4.0 out of 5 stars An interesting episode that is better than the average Animaniacs episode.

This is an okay episode, but it isn't as good as a lot of the other Animaniacs episodes. The episode is pretty random, but they do make some good jokes. The
 While it's not the best film in the world, it's one of the better independent films. The story is original and the acting is pretty good. The movie held my interest throughout. I was thoroughly entertained. If you're looking for a good movie to rent, watch this one. It's not going to be anything amazing, but it's a good movie.

Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) 8 December 2007 * This movie was shot in 1968, but didn't come out until 1971. It was one of the first movies to feature a CGI ape. It was also one of the first movies to introduce the "Planet of the Apes" series, which goes on to include 6 more movies. It's a good movie, but it did have some bad acting. The movie was also a little slow in spots. It was a good movie, but it's not the best.

The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) The Day the Earth Stood Still (
 I saw this movie on the late show and thought it was the coolest. The layout of the film reminded me of a disjointed video game. It should have been the game for the NES. This movie had a total of 5 parts, all of which were shown in the movie. The story starts off on a deserted island, and it's your typical video game. The game does have a story and you could play through the game, but it's not the main focus. The main focus is the "kill the enemies". There are a lot of enemies in the game. They are one hit KOs and the player just has to kill them in a certain amount of hits. The player can only do the most basic attacks, like the punch and the kick. There are also other items in the game like the boomerang, which is used to kill enemies or take out items or enemies. There are also other things that can be used as weapons like the log and the axe. The weapons are used to take out enemies or items. The game is totally different and unique, but not really that hard. There are a lot of different things in the game, but nothing really hard to figure out. The movie is very long,
 I read the first few reviews and I thought they were unfair. I thought they were unfair because they were commenting on the film without having seen the film. I watched this film and I have to say I found it very enjoyable and very pleasant. I think the only two things I didn't like about it are: the guy in the wheelchair, it was a bit corny and a little too much like a 1950s Hollywood film. The other thing was the ending. I liked it but I think it would have been better if they had shown the other society more. Overall it was well done. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a good film.

 This is a wonderful movie. I saw it in the theater and it was great. I had not seen it on video and it was even better. I love movies that are set in the 80's and this is a great one. I remember when I was a kid watching it on TV and I always wondered what happened in the movie after the football game. I really loved it and I would love to see it again. I can't believe it was only made for only a few years. I would love to see it and I think it would be great for people to see it. I can't wait to see it on DVD. It is a wonderful story and I love it. I really think that this movie was made with a lot of care and I think that people should see it. Great movie and I can't wait to see it again.

Houdini (1920) I'm still not sure if I liked this movie or not. 20 March 2005 - 1 out of 4 users found this review helpful. I found this movie to be very difficult to follow. I think the main problem that I had was that I had no idea what was going on throughout the
 The first four parts of the series constitute the best of the series, with a great cast and a fantastic story; the last two parts are the weakest. And I still can't understand the reason why it is the case, because in the rest of the series, by comparison, the story is just as good. <br /><br />The characters are well developed and their relationships are realistic. The cast is simply superb, with many well known international actors, like Elizabeth Hurley and John Rhys-Davies, in the main roles. The story is gripping, fast and exciting, and the very special effects are very well done. The special effects of the dragons, which fly, are very convincing and are not far-fetched. The music is great and fitting, but not intrusive on the story. The pace is very good, but there are some slow episodes that are a little boring. <br /><br />I honestly think the series is a perfect 10, but I'm wary of giving such a grade, because I know that this series has been widely acclaimed, and I am perhaps somewhat biased. But I can't help but feel that there are better shows out there. <br /><br />Only caveat:
 I absolutely believe this should be a classic! Even after seeing it over and over again, it still amazes me and it always brings a smile to my face. "Dirty Dancing" is the kind of movie that never gets old, and it's just plain beautiful. It's not the kind of movie where the main female character is all tortured and has a tragic past and then falls in love with a handsome hero. It's a feel-good movie, and it's just plain fun! The music, the dancing, and the story of this movie is great. There's not much to say about it because it's just plain fun. I love it, and I love all the other movies that are in this series!

<br /><br />The characters are all interesting, especially Johnny, who is the main male character. His character is not just a typical hero, but he's also very flawed. He's sarcastic, smart, and a little selfish, but he has a heart of gold. Johnny is really fun and he is a lot of fun to watch, and he has some good chemistry with the female lead. Jennifer Grey plays a great role as the main female character. Her character is not just a typical
 This movie is The Office with a lot more sex and a lot less Michael Scott. This is the first time I've seen this movie and I thought the premise was pretty good for a movie. The story is about three best friends that seem to have their own lives together and are trying to find the best way to be a couple. The movie is pretty good, I have to admit I was laughing so hard at some of the scenes that I had to check to make sure I was watching a movie, not a reality show. The movie has a lot of good lines in it and the acting is good. The movie is not a good date movie, it would be better watched with a lot of friends in a group of people having a good time. I would recommend this movie to anyone that really likes romantic comedy's. I give it a 8/10.

 A beautifully written and acted film. The character of Edward is one of the most sensitive and humane performances of the year.<br /><br />The direction of the film is very powerful and sensitive. The cinematography is very fine and the editing is very well done. The music is very evocative and the theme song is beautiful.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give the film a 10 is because I thought some of the scenes were a bit too long. The film is nearly 3 hours long. I really had to stretch to give it a 10.<br /><br />The film had a great impact on me. The movie really moved me. I can't stop thinking about it. It is probably the best film I have seen since "The Notebook."

A true gem of a movie

Author: Jeff in Northern Virginia

30 August 2005



After seeing "The Notebook," I was left with the impression that it was saccharine and unrealistic. "Cedar Boys" is the polar opposite. It is a real, honest portrayal of a group of friends
 I think this movie is very funny. A couple of years ago my friend and I made a short film of the same style and the result was wonderful! Even though the only thing from our short was the idea of the plot, there is a big difference between the two. The main difference is that our plot was a bit more serious, while this one is pretty funny and funny. I like it because most of the people in the movie are pretty funny. <br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone who likes comedies!

3.0 out of 5 stars A bit disappointing. Format: DVD I bought this DVD mainly because it was directed by Michael Winterbottom. I have not really liked any of the movies he has directed so far, but I have been told that this one is actually quite good. I'm not sure though. I have to say that I don't think it's very good at all. Not everything is funny and the story is not very original. I also don't think it is very moving. I found it fairly dull. I think it did not live up to my expectations. The film is not bad and if you like Michael Winterbottom, you might like it, but don't expect
 This is a great movie, from start to finish. It is a very touching story about a 5 year old boy that leaves his mother and sister behind to go on a trip to the zoo. The story is about a boy, his mother, his sister, and a zoo keeper. The boy's mother is dying of cancer and his sister is very sick. The boy wants to go to the zoo with his mother and his sister and the zoo keeper. The story is about how the boy really loves his mother and sister and how he is willing to do anything to get them there. The movie is very touching and beautiful. There is not a lot of action in the movie, but it is a very interesting story. The actors are very good and the story is very touching and beautiful. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good story. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

 The story is about a woman who gets knocked up and has to get married to some guy who doesn't want to be a father. The guy wants to get the kid out of the way but she doesn't want to let the kid go. The movie is really well written and the acting is good. It's not a chick flick with a lot of make up and sex scenes. The movie has a very good message. It is a very real story. I would say it is a must see. I recommend this movie.

 I like the original, but I didn't think that it was as good as the original. I don't see what the people who said that it was better than the original saw, but I also agree with the people who said it wasn't as good. I think that this is a good sequel, but I don't think that it is quite as good as the original. I also think that the makers of the sequel should have made this film.

 I saw this film with my cousin, and we both thought it was a great movie. I love it because it is so unique, and it is very funny. I have never seen anything like this before. It is very different, and I think it is a great movie. I would love to see it again and see if it is as good as the first time.<br /><br />My cousin thought it was very funny too, and he loved it.

Good time, good laugh, and great actors.

Author: Sparky from North Carolina, USA
 The most entertaining and best film in the series. The excellent cast brought together in this film work splendidly, especially Don Johnson and Renee Zellwegger. The humor is as good as always, and the way the situation develops is always a surprise. The characters are as interesting as ever, and the story is as good as you might expect. The only problem with this film is that it's almost too good. The end seems a little rushed, and the characters never really seem to reach their full potential. Still, this is a great film, and I recommend it to anyone.

 The Comedian

<br /><br />I have always admired Woody Allen's work, and this film is no exception. The cast is great, and the story is amusing, if predictable. The film is not as funny as some of Allen's other work, but it's still very good. The film is full of great actors, including Rebecca Hall and Chris Rock. It's not quite as funny as some of Allen's previous works, but it's still very good.

Reviewer Score: 8.5

 The Curse of the Jade Scorpion

<br /><br />A hilarious film
 The title may be a bit misleading, as the movie is not set in a dystopian future, but in present day America. And the movie is not a documentary, but a fictional drama.<br /><br />John Sayles is the writer/director of this movie, and he is not afraid to show the effects of the time he lives in. He does not shy away from the real life issues, such as the death of a young man at the hands of a gang of thugs, or the death of a homeless person, both victims of gang violence.<br /><br />The movie takes a number of different turns, and is one of the most original movies I have seen in a long time. It is not a movie you can watch once, but more like a movie you can watch a dozen times.<br /><br />The movie includes strong performances by a number of different actors. I have to say that the strongest performance is given by Robert Duvall, who plays the role of an ex-gang member turned preacher. Duvall's performance is so strong that you can not take your eyes off of him. He is so believable as the character that you are completely taken in, and feel that you are actually
 This is a wonderful, fast-paced, dramatic, and suspenseful movie with a lot of action and thrills and it is well worth seeing. The locations and sets are wonderful and the acting is done exceptionally well. The plot is interesting and the actors are all wonderful and do an excellent job. It is an exciting movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. While it is a movie of action and suspense, it is also a movie of great love and romance. <br /><br />The plot involves a very strong woman, Catherine (Julie Christie) who is a brilliant physicist and engineer, who has a strong but loving relationship with her husband (Anthony Perkins). But when she is kidnapped, she is forced to play a game of Russian Roulette with a terrorist (Hayden Christensen) to get back at him. The movie has lots of action, but it also has a lot of romantic moments. <br /><br />I recommend this movie for people who like action and suspense. It is well made, with a great plot, good acting, and great scenery.

 This movie hasn't been released on DVD yet. I just bought a copy of it on VHS. I'm going to give it a 9/10.<br /><br />This movie, as most Bollywood films, is a beautiful love story. But it also has a message of individuality and being true to yourself. It's also an example of a very successful film. The cast, most of whom are established Bollywood stars, is perfect. The music is great. The cinematography is fabulous. The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it is VERY slow. I have seen many Hindi films and this is one of the slowest I have seen. It's not bad, just slow. If you have the patience, you'll love this movie.

 I walked into the theater with much trepidation, not knowing what to expect. I had seen the movie before, but not since it was first released. I was surprised. I had read the novel and was expecting another adaptation of a book that I had liked. I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting to see a familiar story and instead was given a movie that was fresh, original and exciting. It was a wonderful introduction to the world of modern horror. The acting was superb. I wasn't used to seeing actors that I really liked. The only comment I have is that the story line seemed a bit rushed. I think it could have been stretched out a bit longer. Other than that I think this movie is terrific.

 "Red River" is a good film with a lot of suspense. John Wayne plays a cattleman who is the best of his day at taking care of cattle. He brings his cattle with him to Texas and is promised money. He and a few other men arrive at a river with the cattle and they are told that the river is guarded by a very mean and cruel Indian. The cattle are all unloaded and the men start over to get the cattle across the river when they hear the sound of horses galloping. The cavalry comes in and they go to the other side of the river and the cattle are found to be missing and the Indian is blamed. The cattle are brought back across the river and the owner demands his money. At the same time, the cattle are attacked by Indians and the cattle are killed and the men have to swim for their lives. The cavalry comes and the cattle are killed and the men are taken and put in jail. The Indians are found and the men are let go but the cattle are not returned to the owner. John Wayne finds out about the cattle and goes back to the owner and he says that he wants the cattle. The cattle are found and the owner is angry because of his money. "Red River"

 This film (now out on DVD) is a true masterpiece of professional acting and direction. The story is about a group of friends who are in a car accident in which their friend is killed. The story is told in flashback, as we see the events that lead up to the accident, how the accident occurred and then how the survivors deal with their grief. The acting is superb all around, and the acting is even better in the flashback scenes. The acting is all about realistic and believable emotions, which makes it all the more real. The acting is so good, that you begin to feel what the characters are feeling. The characters are very believable and all the actors play their parts incredibly well. The director and writer are also very good at their jobs, as they show what life is really like, and how it is really done. The director also shows the director's skill by using his camera to show us what the characters are seeing and feeling. The direction is also very good, as the camera work is very good and the angles and cuts help to tell the story. The sound is also very good, with a lot of sound effects such as traffic, the wind and the characters conversation. The background music is also very good and it helps

 When I first watched this in the theater, I was very disappointed. I thought it was going to be like an Americanized version of "My Fair Lady" with a lot of fake British accents. Instead, it was just an okay movie.<br /><br />The real disappointment was that Tony Curtis did not play Henry Higgins. The real Henry Higgins is Sir Henry Higgins. So, to be fair, Tony Curtis was not Henry Higgins, but he was a very good Henry Higgins. The real Henry Higgins is the most handsome man in the world. Henry Higgins had the kindest soul, he was extremely intelligent, and he was a wonderful dancer. Many people say that Tony Curtis was the Henry Higgins of his time. Mr. Curtis was a wonderful Henry Higgins. However, Tony Curtis was a wonderful Henry Higgins. They were two different people. It was a shame that they did not cast the real Henry Higgins.<br /><br />The only other disappointment was that they did not cast the real Eliza Doolittle. The real Eliza Doolittle is a very very beautiful woman. She is even more beautiful in real life. She is a very beautiful woman with a very beautiful voice.<br /><br />The real Henry
 To be honest, I was expecting a lot more from it. I was expecting a lot more from the actors. I was expecting a lot more from the movie. Unfortunately, all I got was a lot of boring, useless scenes. The movie seemed to be just let it run. I mean, this is a very important story and I think if the movie would have done it more justice, it would have been better. But I think the movie was never meant to go this far. It was just a movie for the fans. There is no way it should be that way. There is no way. I could have had a whole movie about it. It would have been better.

The movie started out great. I mean, you have Peter looking into his mirror and seeing the character he is to become. Then we have his performance as the Night King. I have never seen him so good. He was so amazing. And then he broke up with the actress who played his wife. And then there was the scene where he got sick and he was in the hospital. And then there was the scene where he found out that he was the Night King. Then there was the scene where he got stung by the scorpion.
 I loved this movie. It's so much fun, it's a mixture of horror and comedy. The cast is terrific - Edward Furlong, that was hilarious! And the special effects are incredible. It's a good story and the action builds up to a very frightening climax. The plot is good and the movie is well-paced. I think the most terrifying part of the movie is when the evil spirit is born into the house. That scene is so creepy and scary! I am so glad I saw this movie. I would recommend it to anybody who likes horror or comedy. I think it's very underrated. This is a gem of a movie.

 If you are a fan of westerns and especially the old gritty ones, you'll love "High Lonesome". I loved this movie. It had everything. Action, drama, and romance. The storyline was great, and the characters were very well developed. I especially love how the characters were not one dimensional, and the actresses portraying them were very well suited to their characters. The story was very well done, and the dialog was exceptional. I have to say that the movie was very well directed, and the cinematography was excellent.

 I watched this movie on a whim, seeing that it was at least a 2 hour movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was an amazing movie and I'm glad I watched it. With only a few exceptions, the acting was amazing (including the dog), the story was interesting and the characters were memorable. The story is an amalgamation of several different stories, including the "Dirty Dancing" story and the "Billy Elliot" story. It's a little bit of everything, and I loved every minute of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants something interesting and different to watch.

7/10

(Note: The narrator of the movie is not bad in the least.)

A good movie to watch with your kids

22 March 2010 - 3 out of 3 users found this review helpful.

A very well made film aimed at children. They don't mention any specifics about it, but it's a good story about four kids who find an old man who tells them about an adventure he had in the past. I think it was a very good film for children, and I would recommend it for them.

 I found this movie as it's original title, "The Dreamers", to be even more beautiful than the one it became, "The Dreamers of the Summer", a few years after the release of this one and I must say, that I'm not the only one. The movie is a very well-made one, with a fine screenplay, beautiful cinematography and very good acting, especially the ones of the two girls, played by Mia Farrow and Mia Sara. The only thing that I find a little strange is the fact that Mia Farrow plays the same role, at least in this movie, as she plays in "The Tin Drum", which was released a year before and it's not as if she did something different in the two movies. Still, I think that the movie is worth watching and it's not a bad thing to take a look at it.

 This is an excellent movie that should have been made long ago. The ending was more than satisfying. I was very surprised, and even more so, with the ending. I wont give it away, but I will say that it is a very intelligent film. It is not a true horror film, as it seems so many films are, but it is a very interesting and intelligent film. The acting is excellent, the script is excellent, and the directing is excellent. I strongly encourage you to see this film. A good 10/10 from me.

 It is a rare thing to find a movie that's simultaneously funny and thought provoking, but this gem from the late 80's does both. Performed by the great Robert Downey Sr., the hilariously funny "Airplane!" is a classic for a reason. Not only is it funny in it's own right, but it also has some very thought provoking moments such as when the group gets stuck in the bathroom at the airport and the members reach their breaking point. If you're looking for a good laugh, this is the movie to watch.<br /><br />

 The movie was a good one, the point of view was good and the acting was good, I think the best acting came from the little girl who played the part of little missy and the mother who played the part of preppy mom. i think that the main and best point of this movie was the point of view, because it gave you a good feel what was happening in the theater, and it was a good way to get the point across, i think the person who made this movie was really good and i think that he should get a good award for this movie. the only bad thing about this movie was that there was no background music, but other than that it was a good movie.

this movie was a good movie to watch, because it was a good movie that was about one girl and her mom. this movie was about how her mom was trying to be a better person and how she realized that she was not a good person, and that she wanted to be more like her mother and wanted to be a better person, and how her mom realized that she had no idea what was going on in her own life and that she was not a good person.

 According to the IMDb, this film is based on the life of Sabu Dastagir (1837-1894), a British-educated Indian Muslim who fought for the British in the First Afghan War. The movie, which is set in the 19th century, is a romantic tragedy, which is not at all what I had been expecting. While the film is based on real events, it is quite different from the actual story that I heard. I have read several articles on the film and have been trying to figure out what the movie was based on. The IMDb tells me that the film is based on the true story of Sabu Dastagir, who fought for the British in the First Afghan War. The IMDb also tells me that Dastagir was a British-educated Indian Muslim who fought for the British in the First Afghan War. This is not quite true. While Dastagir was a Muslim, he was not from India. He was born in China. He was educated in England and worked for the British in India. His goal was to help the British in their fight against the Russians. One of the central themes in the film is that of British colonialism. Since most members of the
 The first movie I ever saw that was not a horror movie and was quite enjoyable. I was 9 years old at the time and it made me want to watch more. I remember seeing it on television and my family was watching it. I was so excited to see a movie that wasn't a horror movie. I also remember it being in theaters. I loved seeing the movie on the big screen. The acting, the music, the storyline, everything about the movie was really really good. I remember thinking that Jennifer Aniston was really hot. I didn't know that she was a famous actress at the time. I just thought she was the most beautiful girl in the whole movie. I know that this movie didn't do great but it was still a great movie. I hope that one day it can be released on DVD.<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10

***I was given this movie by my mom as a gift. This is my opinion and you may have a different opinion.***

 I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of heart and has a great cast. I would have to say it was a 10. I can't think of any flaws. The acting was great. I loved the relationship between Grace and her son. I really felt for Grace and her son. I thought she was a great actress. I was also very impressed with the way the movie was filmed. The movie was shot in a way that made you feel like you were right there. The look and feel of the movie was very authentic. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.

 This film is quite different from other horror anthologies like the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. It is a bit more psychological than the regular slasher film. In "Shivers", the killer uses his body to literally manipulate the victims before his death. The only real gore that is shown is the face being torn off after being impaled, but the overall feeling of the film is much more disturbing then your usual slasher film. The film is filled with characters that are not just one dimensional stereotypes. The main character is a young college student who has a sister that he's been separated from for a year. The sister is the typical "I'll always be there to help you friend" character. She is the only one that is not afraid to go up against the killer. The killer is a big man who is obsessed with the game "Castle of Frankenstein". He is always listening to the radio and is always reading books on the subject. He also has a girlfriend who is very nonchalant about this situation. The film is also filled with a bit of comedy as well as some romance between the two main characters. The only problem with the film is that it is a bit too long. There is a lot of unnecessary
 I love this movie. The movie has some fun parts and the animation is very different and unique. The characters are interesting and funny. The movie has a lot of history and some of the characters are based on real people. The movie shows how the Japanese and Chinese work together to build the railroads and the movie shows how the Japanese steal the railroads from the Chinese and also how the Japanese control the railroads to make the railroad run in the direction they want it to run. I recommend this movie. I think that this movie is one of the best war movies ever made.

 A really good horror film, that has a lot of suspense, some gore and a few scares. I really enjoyed this movie and it was easy to get into. It had some good character development and some good twists and turns.<br /><br />The movie did have its problems though. The movie was slow and a little confusing at times. The plot was a little hard to follow and not much seemed to have happened. It seemed like a lot was going on but there weren't enough scenes to really explain a lot of it. I thought some of the character development was a little weak as well.<br /><br />The movie had a good cast though. I've never seen Justin Long before but he did a good job. He was convincing as the 'detective' and he was likeable. The real star of the movie was the 'killer' though. The killer in the film was very creepy looking and played his part very well. There were also a couple of other minor characters as well.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this movie. It's suspenseful, scary and interesting. I thought it was a great movie and I look forward to seeing other movies by director-writer Marco Brambilla
 This movie is just wonderful. I haven't seen the original movie but if this is anything to go by I will definitely be seeing that one. The actors are fantastic and the story is like that of The Secret Garden with a modern twist. I loved it from start to finish. It is utterly charming, funny and has a lot of heart. The only bad thing about it is that it is over so fast, I want to see it again really really soon! This one could easily have been a blockbuster but I think it was a good move not to push this one. It's perfect as it is and I know a lot of people will agree with me when I say that they have got a winner on their hands!<br /><br />It is the third Disney movie I have seen this month and I am sure I will still be saying that next month as well.

5.0 out of 5 stars Perfection in a bottle HALL OF FAME VINE VOICE Format: DVD Winnie-the-Pooh is a very popular character with young children, but it is also a very clever story. The charm and innocence of the story means that the Disney studios were able to do it in a very child friendly
 A decent film that has a nice, simple story. It has a little bit of action and a lot of emotion. It's not perfect, but it's a good basic film. I especially liked the music. The beginning was weak, but as it went on it really picked up. I didn't like the ending, but that's just me. Overall, a good one.

 As someone who loves movies, I found this movie to be one of the best. The plot was well paced, the acting superb and the tension was continuously building up to the inevitable climax with a poignant ending. The music, however, was disappointing, and some of the scenes looked rather cheesy. All in all, it was a great movie, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves suspense.

I rented this movie on a whim, and I can't believe I watched the entire thing without a break. It kept me on the edge of my seat and was better than most movies I have seen. The plot had twists that most movies don't have, and the acting was excellent. The final scenes were very surprising. I have no idea how a movie could be better, but it was. This movie should be seen by anyone who loves movies (or suspense).

 "The Wages of Fear" is one of the best films of the 50s. I had'nt seen it in many years after buying it back in the early 90s. The film contains a bunch of good, but not great elements. It seems to be a little slow at first, but it really picks up at the end. The characters are a little flat and one dimensional. The acting is weak, but I liked the characters. The script is pretty good, especially the scenes between the men on the road and the woman and child. The direction is pretty good, but the film is not that scary. The film is long at over 2 hours, but it is interesting and you will probably not want to stop watching it.<br /><br />A couple of things about the film and the DVD: The film is not in the best shape, but the print is still OK. The film has good sound, but the picture is not that great. There are a lot of static scenes. The film is in 1.85:1 and there is a good picture and sound mix. I am not sure if the film is supposed to be cut, but it is not. There are a few scenes where the characters are talking
 I thought this was a great movie. It was entertaining and well-written. When I saw the movie I was thinking it was going to be a spoof of the genre, but it turned out to be a really good action flick. I think the only thing I didn't like was that it was so obviously a spoof of the genre, but I guess that's what it was going for. The scenes with the two guys in the bathroom were just hilarious, and so was the scene when the two guys were trying to get into the car. There were some good action scenes, but the first half of the movie seemed a little slow. The movie is based on a novel that I haven't read yet, but it's definitely on my list of books to get to.<br /><br />I'd give this movie a solid 8 out of 10.

 I don't know how I missed this film when it came out, but I hope it gets more attention. I finally saw it last night on a cable station and loved it. This is a great example of the potential of a good dramatic film. It is not a typical "love story" that we've all seen so many times. It is also not a typical "horror" film. It is, however, a great film. It is one of the best love stories I have ever seen, and one of the best examples of an unrequited love I've ever seen. It is the story of a man who has never loved anyone and the woman who has never been loved. I haven't seen it a second time, but I'm sure I'll see it again.

And the ending is great!

I'm a big fan of "The Big Chill," and "The Big Chill" is one of the best films of all time.

The cast is great. It's a shame that it isn't more popular, but I think it deserves to be.

I can't wait to see it again. I saw it for the first time last night and loved it.

 The making of a movie always has its share of problems, especially when the movie is based on a book and the book is to large to be made into a movie. In the case of The Crucible, you have to come up with a way to condense the book and make it work as a movie. For the most part, they succeeded. The movie is long enough to give us the story and at the same time, keep it interesting. The acting is good and the story itself is interesting. Kevin Bacon did an excellent job with the role of John Proctor. He kept him true to the original character, with all its strengths and weaknesses, and still made him likeable. It was hard to see him as the villain in the play. There were two parts where the movie was not quite as good, but they were not that big of a problem. The first part was the scene where John Proctor and Abigail (Winona Rider) meet and fall in love. The movie doesn't really show this, but the book does. The movie doesn't show them talking about their feelings, which is something that the book does. The other part of the movie that was not quite as good was the part where the witches
 I thought this was a great movie for a couple reasons. First, I am a HUGE Richard Dreyfuss fan, and he was excellent. And, he was also very funny in this movie. Second, I thought the plot was very original, and out of the ordinary. I hate movies where the same plot is used again and again, but this one I would recommend to people. And, I think you will enjoy what you get because it has a nice, light touch to it. It's not scary, it's not a comedy, it's just a good time at the movies. I actually saw this movie at a movie theater. It was not a typical movie. It was just a good movie. I thought it was funny, and I thought it was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone.

 I thought this film was very well made. The story is touching and believable. The acting is fantastic and the writers are so talented. As far as the content of the film goes, it is a very well done realistic portrayal of what people go through when they are alone in a cave. I loved the way the camera was used to show the pain of the cavemen and how they were starving. The camera was able to take you into the cave and you could feel the pain that the characters were feeling. This movie is not for the faint of heart. The brutal nature of the cavemen is very upsetting. It is very realistic in showing how the cavemen must have felt. The characters are very well written and the actors are excellent. I really enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies that are very well made, realistic, and touching.

 I've rated this film with 9.5, for the simple reason that, although I greatly enjoyed the film, I didn't like the story (I felt there was too much emphasis on the religious aspects of the film). The idea of the film was a good one, but the way it was presented was very poor. I felt the film should have been more of a story that went with the characters, and not one where the characters told the story of the film. I have to agree with other viewers that this film should have been a bit more of a comedy, as the first half is very dark and serious, but as it goes on, it becomes a bit more light and funny. I feel the ending wasn't really strong, and I would have liked to see the film end a bit differently, and not the way it did. I would love to see a sequel to the film, as it is a great story, and I would love to see it continued in another film.

The actors were all good, and I also loved the location, which really added to the film. I also loved the scenes that were in the dark, as it showed how the characters were feeling, and I felt it was a great way
 I was surprised by this movie. It was not what I expected. <br /><br />It was a very good movie. I like the way the movie was filmed. It showed the beauty of the ocean. The scenery was absolutely beautiful. The characters were very strong and the dialogues were deep. I liked the actors and actresses. All of them did a great job. The love they have for their family is really amazing. <br /><br />I liked the way the story was told. It was not just a film. It was a great movie. I really enjoyed it. <br /><br />I think this movie is very important. The world is more and more getting more and more polluted, and we are more and more getting more and more aware of that. But the way we are handling it is the way it should be done. If we care about the future of the planet, we have to protect nature and not destroy it. It's nice to see a movie that shows us how important it is to take care of nature. I think everybody should see this movie. It's worth seeing.

 Hee Haw is a staple in American entertainment history. The country's longest running show, (beating out Ed Sullivan and the like), and one of the most successful variety shows in history. Of course, it's not just the country that loves it. It's also a comedy icon on episodic television, and is a staple on cable television. It's so culturally significant that it's the basis of a musical. Hee Haw: The Musical toured the country for a few years, with a cast that included Cheech and Chong. Now, Hee Haw has finally made it to DVD. The original Hee Haw show is here, from 1975 to 1977. And it's a major treasure. The show was every bit as funny, if not funnier, than the later years. The humor was clean, and the cast was incredibly talented. The songs were top-notch, and the sketches were a hoot. This collection includes a lot of classic episodes, including the famous "Hold The Mustard," the "Hee Haw Hotel," the "Peach Prom," and the "Icky, Sticky, Gooey, Oozy, Goo." The DVD also includes a lot of extras. They include a
 It's hard to believe it's been (almost) 20 years since this grisly and fun little slasher hit theaters in the summer of 1995. Sure, there have been plenty of slasher movies since then but none were as much fun as this one. It's got a terrific cast in the likes of Brian Krause, John Leguizamo and Lorenzo Lamas, not to mention a great script by the great James Leo Herlihy. There are some pretty gruesome kills but what makes this movie stand out is how funny it is. It's a pretty hilarious movie although the violence is pretty intense at times. This is a great slasher that even the most die hard of fans of the genre will enjoy.

 I saw this movie at my local theater along with a few other movies, and it was really good. If you're old enough and you remember watching the original Star Trek, then you'll see the similarities.

A Review by Danny C.

The movie is about a group of people that are stuck on a space station and are trying to find a way back to earth. The ship that they are on is slowly going to pieces and they are slowly losing oxygen. The movie is full of action as the station is attacked by a group of unknown aliens and they are trying to fight off the attackers. The two main characters are Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) and Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley). Captain Archer is commander of the space station, while Dr. Phlox is the doctor on board. When the attack begins, the budget is cut off and communications are lost. The movie is filled with action,
 I won't go into the plot (it's pretty much what you'd expect in this kind of movie), but it's wonderful to see the many different versions of the same myth told so many different ways. I've seen the song in the original Broadway version and the London revival, and am always happy to see it presented in other ways, like in this movie.<br /><br />The acting is good, particularly the supporting cast. If you enjoy musicals and fairy tales, this is definitely a movie to watch.

A magical blend of folklore.

Author: jk from NY

28 May 2004



I must say that I'm a big fan of musicals, but I was really surprised by this one. It's not your typical musical where all the songs are about love and romance. This is a musical about magic, folklore, songs about happiness, life and death. The music, the lyrics, and the acting are all so beautiful, and I was really impressed by all the actors. I wasn't expecting to be so impressed by such a simple story.<br /><br
 This movie was an interesting blend of comedy and drama, and I thought it was very well done. The comedy was very subtle, and the actors were excellent. There were some very emotional moments, and I think this movie would make a good date movie because of the emotional aspect. Overall, it was a very good movie.

The DVD is a very good quality DVD, which was a plus for me. I think the sound quality was good, and the picture quality was very good. The only thing that I would have liked to see is a commentary track, but I'm sure there will be one available somewhere on the internet.

 I saw this film at a film festival in Oregon in 2007. I didn't know who directed it but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a high budget film with some of the most amazing looking creatures I have ever seen on film. It was shot in the desert and it has a very beautiful look to it. The film has a variety of interesting characters and the plot is intriguing.<br /><br />The film was very well shot and has some great scenes. It has some very impressive scenes that are very artistic. There are some very long scenes in the film but they are very well shot and the film is never boring. The plot is very interesting and the characters are very interesting.<br /><br />The film may be a little slow in the beginning but it picks up very quickly after that. The cast is very good and the dialogue is good. The plot is very interesting and keeps you entertained. The film is very well shot and has some very impressive effects.<br /><br />I give this film 8 out of 10.

A unique story of love and freedom

Author: irishste
 I first saw the movie when I was about seven years old. I remember everything about it, from the opening scene to the end. I'm sure it's no coincidence I have watched it at least a hundred times since then, and continue to enjoy it very much. That was almost twenty years ago, and I still recall every detail.<br /><br />The movie is one of those you know you will never forget. The plot is very simple, very predictable, but it is so well executed that you just cannot stop watching.

 Who doesn't love The Goonies? Who doesn't love John Hughes? Who doesn't love bad movies? Well, this is one of the best and worst of the bad. It's watchable, but not too fun. I'm a big fan of John Hughes, in fact I love most of his stuff, but I still think it's overrated and over-hyped. I like the cast, which is great, but they're not allowed to do much. The story is just too simple. The music is good, but it's not memorable. The special effects are great, but that's all they are. I still like the movie, but I don't love it. I wish they would've made an extended edition to this movie. It would've been better. But, if you're a fan of The Goonies, you're gonna love this movie.

 I liked this movie because it's a good story with a lot of action. The story is about a guy named Bill Sikes (Matthew Modine) who used to be a member of a motorcycle gang. He was a mean and cruel bully and his friends nicknamed him Bill Sikes because he was always stealing bikes and then he was the one who threw the bikes into the river. One day he was the one who stole a motorcycle and his brother's bike. His brother was named Charlie (Jason Patric) and he was killed when Sikes threw the bike in the water. Sikes' brother was killed by a gang of bikers but Sikes didn't see his brother die. Charlie's dad (David Strathairn) was a cop and he found out that Sikes was the one who murdered his son. Charlie's dad was one of the gang members who were trying to catch Sikes. Sikes was hiding in a cabin that his dad owns in the woods. Sikes didn't want to go back to jail so he decides to start a new life in the cabin. And Charlie's dad wants revenge for his son's death. Will Charlie's dad catch Sikes? Who will be the one who gets to S
 I love this movie. All the characters are memorable, and the situations they find themselves in are very funny and often bizarre. I like the idea that the main character is a teenager, and that's his whole life. This is a rare movie that is funny, smart, exciting, and true to life. I was never bored watching it.

I think the thing that makes this movie so great is how well the characters are written and their interactions with one another. The story is also pretty good, and the idea of the kid becoming a rock star is interesting. I was also surprised by how much I liked the acting. I had heard that the acting was really bad in this movie. I don't know why people would say that because I think the acting was pretty good. I also like how the movie is full of music.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.

 A very excellent film that I think is not as well known as it should be. The story is a classic and very well told. The acting is at a very high standard and the direction is spot on. The script is well written. The film takes in several sub-plots and combines them together very well. The cinematography is excellent and the music is very good and well used. The film is very much a character driven story and the characters are very likeable and believable. The film is very hard to categorise and I would say it is a film you should definitely see.

 In this movie, Anne Heche (as a very young child) plays a child that is being abused sexually by her father (played by William Hurt), and she is rescued by her mother (played by Winona Ryder). Her mother is a lawyer, and she is sent off to an orphanage to stay with a couple of nuns (played by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis). At the orphanage, the young girl is given a new name, and her life is changed forever. The movie, based on a true story, is about her new life, and how she was able to escape from her abusers. This is not a bad movie, but it is not all that great either.

This movie is about the young girl's life after she has left the orphanage. She is a very shy young woman, and doesn't ever really make any friends. She is also a very strong woman, and doesn't let anyone make her feel less than she is. She is afraid of the outside world, and doesn't ever let anyone see her cry. She is very mysterious, and no one ever really gets to know her. But this could be because she is so closed off, she doesn't want anyone to know who
 I have to admit I didn't expect much from the story of a young girl who pursued the 'dark side' of the music business. I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that begins with the very first song, 'Eyes', and ends with the final song of the CD, 'Deja Vu'. <br /><br />The music is rather dark and the lyrics are so beautifully poetic. I love the way the stories are carried on to the next song. I loved the CD and it's really nice to see the songs performed live. <br /><br />I'll recommend this to anyone who is into the music of The Cure. And I'm going to go back and listen to the songs and enjoy them again.

A Dark, Creepy, Yet Beautiful and Poetic Story

"Eyes Without a Face" is a beautiful and poetic story about a young girl named Alice who falls in love with a
 I was always fascinated by the lives of japanese samurai. The feudal times were an interesting period of Japanese history. I watched many movies about them. But the most interesting part of their story was the fact that they could not die. It was an interesting idea that you could be afraid of death, but still alive. This movie is a kind of a tribute to the samurai. I must say that this movie is very beautiful. The scenery is wonderful, the costumes are great and the actors did a great job. The plot is quite simple. The samurai is still alive and he has to go on a mission to find his master. But he meets a beautiful woman. He falls in love with her and he wants to marry her. But his master is against this marriage. I think it is a very good film with a simple story. I really enjoyed it and I think you will too. I give it 10/10. The only reason I deduct is because of the subtitles.

 A good effort, but it is not a great comedy. I was expecting more laughs. The kids have to go to the hospital to get their appendix out. But doctors there don't know what an appendix is. One of the doctors is a woman, and she is very good. Also, the doctor is a little old lady, and she looks like a grandma, but she is very good. The kids are funny, and the jokes are funny. I laughed. There are some good jokes about the kids getting the appendix out. There are some good jokes about the kids going to the hospital. I laughed a lot. The jokes are good. I gave this movie a 7/10.

This is a very funny movie, but it is not a great movie. The movie takes place right after Ally Sheedy's character, Veronica, has a fight with her boyfriend. The movie is about Veronica and her friend, and they go to the hospital to see a doctor. Veronica thinks that they see
 While this film is listed as a comedy, I found it to be a very sad and moving story about a girl growing up in a small town in India. Each segment of the movie follows the same story, but is told in a different way. The first segment follows the girl as a child as she lives with her father and her grandfather. For this segment, the movie uses stop-motion animation, which is interesting to watch. The story is about how the girl is growing up and learning about the world, and I found it to be very inspiring. The next segment of the film shows the girl as a young woman and her life as a young woman, and this time it is in color. Again, the movie is very emotional and touching. The third segment shows the girl as a grown woman, and this time it is in color. The movie shows her life as a mother, and is also very touching. I found this to be a great movie, and would recommend it to anyone. I give it a 10/10.

 It's a great movie with a lot of attention to detail. The only negatives are that the beginning is a little slow, but then just before the action starts the film explodes and you do not want to stop watching. The second thing is that at times the accents of the characters are not right, but this is a minor problem and in no way detracts from the film. I think this movie is so great because it is not just another action movie, but it also has a real story and a great message. It is a movie that teaches you to live life to the fullest, and you learn that nothing is impossible.

 I have been watching this show since I was a kid. It was on in the early 60's and I loved it. I never thought it would ever be cancelled. I was happy when they brought it back. I am so happy that they are bringing it back again. I watch it when I can. I am in my late 70's and it is great to watch with my family. We love it.

One thing that is great about the show is that it doesn't have a lot of violence. There are some scenes that are a little violent but it doesn't last long. It is a great family show with a lot of heart.

I hope this show will be around for a long time. This is one of my favorite shows.

I just love it.

It is a show that I will always remember.

 I haven't had the pleasure of seeing the original movie (though I've heard it's a good one) so I can't compare the two. This is pretty close to the original though, I think.<br /><br />All in all, this is probably the best live action Star Trek movie ever made. I enjoyed it so much I watched it three times in one day. I have to say I have a soft spot for this film because I'm a huge Star Trek fan, and I'm talking TOS and TNG fan. <br /><br />The story is a bit different than the original, but it works well. They're both about the crew of the Enterprise (only this time the Enterprise is in between its seventy-fifth and eighty-fifth year). <br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Star Trek, or someone who's into the original movies, or anyone who's into the whole Star Trek mission.

<br /><br />This is the best of the Star Trek movies. I can't wait for the next one.

 This is an excellent film. It is based on a true story of the worst events in human history. The acting is superb, and the acting is not the only good thing about the film. The film has a good story, and a good mystery that keeps the viewer interested throughout the film. The only problem with the film is the editing. The film has major jumps in time, when this is done, it makes the film hard to follow. My suggestion is to get the DVD, if you are interested in this film. But if you are not interested in this film, then don't waste your time, because the film is not for you.

 This movie is one of the best that I have ever seen. It has excellent special effects, and a story that will have you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end of the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is well worth the watch.

Not really a spoiler, but in the movie, it does show a picture of the very talented actor, Tom Cruise, and his wife, Nicole Kidman.

This movie also has a sequel, and I can't wait to see it.

If you haven't seen this movie, you need to.

Enjoy.

1.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing Format: DVD After watching the first 3-4 minutes, I knew this movie would be a disappointment. The story was confusing and the special effects were unacceptable. The movie didn't tell a story, it showed a story. It was just a bunch of different things happening in a movie. I wanted to see the story end and get back to my life. I am glad that I rented this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

5.0 out of 5 stars Entertaining, cerebral and scary in spots
 I have been watching this movie for a few years now and I have never been so amused by a movie in my life. I don't know if it's just me, but I found this movie extremely funny. There were parts of this movie that were so funny that I had to look away for a few seconds and even rewind the tape to make sure I didn't miss any of the funnier parts. I don't know how this movie got such a bad reputation on the internet, but it is a top-notch comedy.<br /><br />This movie is very "old" as in it came out in the early 80's, but I don't know how people can call this movie "dated" because it is actually one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It's very well-written with a few very funny scenes. I don't know any other movies that have had me laughing as hard as this movie. If you have never seen the movie, I recommend you rent it. You won't be disappointed.

 There are so many things to like in this movie. The acting is superb. A superb performance by Lena Olin, which is holding her own against the other actors. It's good to see the return of Giancarlo Giannini, who is still a big name in Italian cinema. He's playing a police inspector and he brings a lot of energy and a certain danger to the movie. The movie is also good because it's about love, about young people and about that desire to go out and see the world. A great love story, with a lot of humor and at the same time a little bit of danger. All in all, a good movie.

The movie is based around a true story. In the early 90s, the idea was proposed of a cyber attack on the Vatican. It was located in a small city of the Italian region of Lombardy, which is called Brescia. There was a little problem with the police and the Vatican Police decided to solve the mystery. The movie has a lot of humor, a lot of romance, a lot of action and a lot of police. The acting is
 I watched this because I wanted to see how the story of Macbeth would be told. And I must say, I was very pleased.<br /><br />First and foremost, I must say that the acting was very good in this movie. I was surprised by the chemistry between the two main characters. Though they were not the best actors, they were very convincing in their characters, and I think they did a wonderful job. They are both very dramatic, and the most important thing of all, they have amazing chemistry. <br /><br />The story was very good in this movie. It wasn't very complicated, but it was very good. It was very interesting, as it gave me a different view of the story of Macbeth than the one I have read before. The most important thing is that it was very dramatic, and it kept me at the edge of my seat. I thought that this movie was very good.

My advice to you: if you are looking for a good movie to watch, then I recommend The Last King of Scotland.

7/10 (very good)

 I have seen this film a few times, and the first time i watched it at a friend's house. I have to say that i was really impressed by it. I was very disappointed in the director's cut of "Fahrenheit 451." I will not go into detail about it because some people might not enjoy this film. I will however say that the director's cut was a disgrace to the film. I still stand by my opinion that when the director's cut was released, they cut out some of the best parts of the film. The first time that i watched this film, i thought it was amazing. Tim Robbins is great as always, but i was also surprised by the performance of Helen Mirren, who plays a teacher in the film. They both have some great scenes together. The look of the film is really good, and i really liked the music. The only thing about this film that i did not like was the ending. I was so disappointed, because when i saw the director's cut, i wanted the film to end in a way that it did. It was so disappointing. But that is one of the reasons why i like this film, it is a very strong film, and i have never seen anything
 I saw the film at the New Orleans Film Festival, and it was a dynamite opening title, deserving of the audience's buzz and the press's attention. I was one of the audience who loved it.<br /><br />"The Hammer" is a totally unconventional film, half thriller and half action-adventure. It's an exploration of the American psyche, a tale of the individual confronting the forces of modernity and technology. It is also a highly successful, if not brilliant, piece of filmmaking. <br /><br />The plot is simple: Tom (the excellent Michael Biehn) is a small-time mobster who is on the run in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. He wanders through the underbrush, and finally comes across a car with a dead man in it. The man's body is covered with a sheet. Tom is intrigued, and decides to investigate. He peels back the sheet, and discovers the body is that of a young man, the victim of a grotesque accident. Tom takes the body back to a nearby camp, and decides to wait for the authorities. The authorities are, instead, the mysterious, enigmatic, and ominous Mr. Hammer.<br /><br />Mr
 I saw "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" at the age of 11, when I was still an AVID Beatles fan. I felt that this film was very accurate, as it is a full length feature film presented in a documentary feel. It was my first introduction to the Beatles, and I was so impressed by the music, the costumes, and the film. I even bought their albums and taped the music. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves the Beatles, and anyone who loves films.

The film starts out with interviews of those who worked on the film and the Beatles. It follows the Beatles through their career, and follows the interviews with them. It also follows the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It ends with a live performance of the song "With A Little Help From My Friends". A very interesting film for any fan of The Beatles to watch, and I do recommend this film to all Beatles fans.

 I loved this movie. I have always loved movies about the French Revolution, and this is one of my favorites. And it's even more interesting because it was made in 1933, a year before the actual revolution. The movie is terrifically acted, and the actors know their history, which is important. The one thing that I didn't really like about the movie was the fact that a lot of the dialogue, particularly between the two French soldiers and the woman robin who was a prisoner, was all in British English, which I'm sure was a challenge for the actors, but it was just a bit annoying for me. This movie is worth watching, though, and I'm glad I did.

 Although this film is very dated, it is reminiscent of the old-school comic book super heroes of the 1940s and 1950s. While it is certainly not a great film, it is still a fun ride and a good watch if you enjoy the great 1930s and 1940s movies. I particularly love the scene where the lead hero, Ned (played by Edward Arnold), escapes from the prison for a crime he did not commit. This scene is very reminiscent of the scene in Batman (1939) where the Caped Crusader escapes from jail! The cast is great and the script is witty and witty.

The villain in this film (played by George Zucco) has a great costume (especially the cape) and great lines. The villain is also very reminiscent of "The Shadow" (1940).

The camera work is also very good. The film is also filled with good music.

The acting is also very good.

This film is not a classic but is a good action/adventure film.

 This movie is a beautifully made film, and has a great premise. The script is intelligent, with some very funny moments. The characters are well drawn, and you can feel the pain of being an immigrant. The director makes great use of the small urban setting of the city. In fact, the film looks like a movie made in the 1980s, and it is a great tribute to the great American independent film movement. The movie is excellent, and I think it is one of the best in recent years. With a great cast, this is one of the best.

I was excited about this movie and I went in with high expectations. I was fully prepared for a movie about an immigrant who comes to the US and struggles to fit in. I was not prepared for the movie to be so boring. There is no real plot and no real character development. The characters are flat and uninteresting.

 One of the best movies I've ever seen. I was literally in tears at the end of the movie. I saw this movie at the age of 14 and I've sung it ever since. It's not just a Poem, it's a movie. I loved the story, the characters, the music, the characters, the characters, the characters and the characters. I've seen it at least 10 times since I was 14 and I can't wait to watch it again. I'm a big fan of the book, and if you haven't read it I suggest you do. It's worth reading, but not necessary. This is one of the movies that I just can't wait to watch again. My favorite line in the movie is the last line of the poem. It's the perfect ending. I love it. I'm going to watch it 3 more times before I post this comment. But I have to say it's my favorite.

 Johanna and her son live on the outskirts of a small town. She is a loving, caring mother, who works in a shop. He is a mischievous boy who is always in trouble. Johanna's marriage is over, and she is struggling with raising her son on her own. She has a few friends, but no family. Her roommate and best friend, Marie, is also single and struggling with raising her three children. One night, Johanna and Marie are talking when Johanna's son comes out of the woods and joins them. He tells them that he is the son of a woman named Johanna, who they have never seen. He tells them that he's been looking for his mother, and Johanna is the lucky one. Johanna and Marie are fascinated by the child and convince him to take them to his mother. For a few months, Johanna and Marie live with the boy's mother, and it doesn't take long for them to fall in love. Only one problem...Johanna's son. He is a strange young man, who seems to have a dark past, which he refuses to talk about. He is a troubled soul, who seems to be hiding from the world. Johanna
 This is one of the best comedies I've seen. It has the classic three-man format with a touch of slapstick, but the humor is subtle and intelligent, and the characters are very well developed. The dialogue is clever, and the pacing is perfect. I really wanted to see more of what happened to them after the movie ended because the characters were so well fleshed out. The two leads are great and the way they played off each other was perfect. I especially loved the scene where they were in their hotel room and one of them was going through the hall closet to find different clothes to wear. The reason I love this movie so much is that the characters are so sympathetic, and the film is so obviously well thought out. I think that's one of the best things about it (along with the great characters and the dialogue), but the humor is really a big part of it too. This is just a terrific film.

 This movie is a classic example of the force of good fighting evil. It is also a good example of how movies can be a mirror of the times. I can't remember when I first saw this movie or how I came to see it. I do know I saw it when I was about 10 years old. It holds a special place in my heart and has always been a favorite. I have watched many times since, but the feelings are still the same. I can recall just the smell of the popcorn and the smell of the movie theater. I was a kid of about 10 who loved to watch movies. I would see them over and over again and still do. I remember loving it as a young kid. I was not only amazed that a movie could be made, but that it was made in the 60's. I remember when they first saw this movie. I was amazed that they had it and my mother and I would sit and watch it. My mother had seen it first and she was very impressed. I was very impressed too. The movie was very good and I was very impressed that I could have it on film. I remember being so excited to watch it. I would go to the local theater to see it. I
 I walked out of the theater feeling like I had just seen a great performance. American psycho is a fantastic film. The film is violent, gory and fascinating. The film is based on the real life story of Patrick Bateman, a wealthy Wall Street executive who turned into a psychotic killer. Bateman is the ultimate "American Psycho" and the film is a brilliant depiction of him. Christian Bale is incredible as the crazed serial killer and he is able to fully put himself into the character. He also shows a lot of range as a performer and is able to convincingly play a cold blooded killer. The film is actually very well written and the story is very captivating. The film is a perfect example of how to do a modern day gangster film. The film is very dark and although it is a brutal film, it is also very entertaining. The film is very violent and has some very graphic scenes, but it never gets too graphic or disgusting. The film contains sex, violence and nudity and the film is not for the faint of heart. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of dark, gory and violent films.

 I thought the movie was good, but not the best. It was very entertaining and the acting is good. It is a very funny movie, and you will laugh at some parts. I give it a 7 out of 10, because there were some parts that were a little dull, and it was a little long. It was very funny though. I would recommend this to everyone. It is a very good movie if you are looking for a good Sunday morning movie. The songs were very good, and the acting was very good. I think anyone will like this movie, so if you are going to rent or buy this movie, you should. I think it is a very good movie.

 This movie is a lot of fun. It is a pure comedy, and I have seen it many times and still laugh out loud. The characters are very well developed, and the acting is very good. I have seen this movie a lot. It has been released on DVD. It was on the TV about a month ago, and I just saw it again a few days ago. I have enjoyed it for years, and I'm sure I will continue to enjoy it for a long time to come. I highly recommend it.

A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) A very good holiday special.

18 December 2000 - 14 out of 20 users found this review helpful. I'm not a Charlie Brown fan, but I love this holiday special. It is one of the best I have seen. It is nice to see the children perform. The music is good, and the story is very good. It's nice to see Linus and Charlie Brown finally reach the same level of maturity. I give it 10 out of 10.

Sleepless in Seattle (1993) A very good romantic comedy
 I've seen this movie twice, the first time when I was six, and once more when I was thirteen. It's a wonderful movie, and I'm glad to see that it's been released on DVD. The animation is great, and the characters are wonderfully drawn. The story is a bit odd, and the ending is kind of a letdown, but overall it's a great movie. I'd love to see more like it, and I can't wait to see this movie again as an adult. If your child likes Winnie the Pooh, then this is a must-see.

 I saw this movie on my first day in high school and fell in love with it. I remember I was going through a rough period and this movie really helped me deal with it. I have always loved it, and I still watch it now, almost 20 years later. I love the feeling of the movie, and the unusual, yet easy to understand storyline. The music, the scenery, the acting, it all just makes the movie that much better. I also love how everyone in the movie is completely different from everyone else, which makes it so unique, and makes the movie that much better. I also love this movie because it helped me heal from my past, and I am forever thankful to this movie for that.

The only problem I have with this movie is the fact that it is not a sequel. I really wish they would put out a sequel to this movie, because it's hard to find a movie that has a good plot, and people tend to watch the plot, not the movie. This movie is definitely worth a watch though, and if you have not watched it yet, please do. I promise you won't be disappointed.

 This is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it several times and it never gets old. This movie is a great family movie. If you are not a fan of movies that are action packed and have a lot of explosions and suspense, then go rent this one. This movie is a great movie for the whole family. The actors are great and the special effects are wonderful.

This movie is about a young boy named Max, who has a lot of secrets. When Max is at his friend's house, his younger sister comes over to play. Max and his friend's sister, Leela, have a lot of fun until Max's father comes home. Max's father is a former spy who has retired and is trying to become a philosopher.

Their father Max tries to explain the world to Leela and Max, but Max and Leela are not interested. Max's father asks the little girl if she would like to go with him to Europe to see his friend's son, but Leela wants to stay with Max. When Max's father asks if Leela will go with him, Leela says she wants to stay with Max. Max's father is not happy with this, but Max and Leela are still
 I saw this movie in the early 1980's, and I loved it. I had seen a lot of TV at the time and thought this was one of the best. I'm sure that the movie is not as funny as it was in the 80's, but it is still a very good movie. I remember it because of the scene where Gopher is in the bar and all the guys are trying to find out where he went, and all the women are trying to find out where he is. I thought that scene was hilarious. It was a good movie, and I loved it. I would love to see it again, but I don't think it will happen. It was a good movie nonetheless.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh.

This movie is really funny, and I really enjoyed it. I have seen it many times, and it is one of my favorites. I recommend this to everyone who likes to laugh. I think this is one of the funniest movies. The movie is about a guy who is trying to lose weight
 This is a very good movie on a subject that is still very relevant: the relationship between the sexes. The movie does a great job of showing the different views from both sides of the argument. It presents a well written script and the actors do a fine job. It is a good movie for all ages and genders. I think that the movie is a good choice for a family outing since it is fairly easy to understand and has some good humor in it. I think that the movie has a good message and it would be a good way to start a discussion about the subject in the media. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies that have a good message and are interesting. I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars.

 Here is a film that could have been made by either the British or the French, but which manages to be quite a gem of a film. <br /><br />The film begins in the 1980s, when the French government is beginning to see the need to deal with the problem of the unemployed in the near future. The film then fast forwards to the early 1990s, when the French government has decided to take action. The film shows the effects of the unemployment on society and the damage that it is doing. It is particularly effective in showing how the unemployed are slowly turning to crime. The film is also very well made, with some good acting. <br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the problems of unemployment in the French society.

 This movie had me smiling from beginning to end. I thought the way they set it up was brilliant. The acting was believable, the directing was great, the ending was unexpected but fitting. I don't think anyone can watch this movie and not have a good time. This movie is a must see.

 In this TV comedy movie, Jack Lemmon is the owner of a department store in the Southern part of the United States. He is a widower, who has two daughters; Tressie (Shelley Long) and Wilma (Shelley Long). The girls are very attractive, and the two just love their daddy. They are pretty well known in the community, and are accepted as a family unit. While the girls are out of the house, their father meets up with a beautiful single mother (Cloris Leachman) who is quite well off. Shortly after, they become very good friends, and they work well together. Soon, they are getting along very well, and they soon become good friends. Jack's daughters are a bit surprised, as they don't think it's right to have a friend in her home. After a while, they decide to tell their father that they have a friend in the house. Jack is a bit confused, as he didn't know they had a friend in the house. The father and the daughters learn to live with their new friend, and they make it work. This is a fun movie, and it is sure to make you laugh. Jack Lemmon and Cloris Le
 I loved this movie from start to finish. The acting is superb, the story is perfect and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen. The only critique I would make is the acting of Jake Gyllenhaal. He is the reason the film is so good, but he's not a good enough actor to hold the film down. If he had a stronger role and did a better job, he would have made the film. The music is also very good. It's the soundtrack I would most like to get a copy of. All in all, I give it a 9/10 and recommend it to everyone.

One of the best films of the year. It's funny, the acting is great, and there's a lot of laughs. The thing that makes this film great is the acting. John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are great together and you can tell that they have respect for each other. The story of the film is very interesting and its very funny. There are a lot of great scenes in the film and some that are very funny. They've also done a great job on the music
 Halle Berry is AWESOME in this movie. She is the best thing about the film. I love how she is so strong, yet she looks so amazing! I love her hair and her clothes. She is cool and sexy! I also really like the film, but I do not really like the plot. The plot is pretty weak and the movie has a few plot holes. I like how the plot does not entangle itself in one spot and then stop. Rather, it keeps going and keeps changing. I find it interesting that the plot does not have a message, but it is still very cool. I like how it is quiet and slow. I think that it is a good movie to watch at home, like when you are on your own. I recommend this movie to girls who like Halle Berry and to girls who like movies with a plot that is a little weird, but interesting.

 This is a great film. It is good for a post-apocalyptic film, and I like post-apocalyptic movies. It's a little bit on the violent side but that's what makes it thrilling. It has plenty of action and suspense, but it's not brutal and gruesome. There is a fair amount of gore, but it isn't gratuitous. This is a good movie for anyone who likes watching a good action movie. I highly recommend it.

 The story of a young man's struggle to make a life for himself in a community in which he is the only person of color. When he is offered a job at a store in the neighborhood, he is painfully forced to confront the racism existing in the community. The story is told in a matter-of-fact manner as the young man is forced to grow up far too quickly. The film is based on a play by Paul Green and is directed by the great Don Siegel. It's interesting to note that the actors are unknowns to most of the audience. I guess that is the point. The story is told from the point of view of the young man and this gives it a feeling of honesty and truth. The fact that it was filmed in a small town in the southwest makes it all the more apparent that this is how life really is. There are some bad moments in the film, especially when the young man is forced to reveal his relationship to the man who pays the bills. But these are few and far between and the film is constructed in a way that keeps the audience interested throughout. The acting is excellent, with the young man and the older woman who gives him a job both doing a fine job. It's a
 It's a sad fact that the vast majority of people who make it to their 40s and beyond try to live their lives for the future, typically focusing on their children and/or their careers. One of the great appeals of "Gloria" is that it's a rare movie that focuses on the future, while also giving a truly honest portrayal of the past.<br /><br />The movie is based on the life of Gloria Vanderbilt, who lived a fascinating life. She lived in a huge mansion filled with priceless art and furniture. She was raised by her father, who was unable to care for her and her sister, so he sent her to boarding school at age 7. She never returned to live with him, and at age 18 she married a man who was older than she was. The marriage lasted only a few months before she filed for divorce, which was granted by the court. She then married again, only to have the marriage end in divorce as well. She married a third time at age 48, eventually settling in Florida. She had a number of affairs, and eventually she found herself in love with a man she met at a party. She gave up her career as a model, and she and her husband bought

 When I first saw this movie, I was astounded. After seeing it a second time, I was floored, on the floor, in awe. This was a story like nothing I'd ever seen before. It was a touching story about an individual trying to find his place in the world. I found myself crying at the end. This is a movie that definitely deserves a 10.

My only regret is that the producers didn't get the chance to finish the story. I would have loved to have seen the rest of the movie.

If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it. It's worth it.

The cast is wonderful. I especially liked the young boy that brought a real sense of realism to his character.

The storyline is a little slow, but it's well worth the wait.

 The movie is well made. The acting is good and the story is decent. I like the story, but the quality of acting is not as good as it could have been. I was disappointed that I did not see any of the clips from the movie when I got home. I would have liked to see them all. I am not sure if it is good to have the movie without the clips, but I would have rather seen them. The movie is about a woman who is trapped in a war. The reason for her being trapped is that her husband has been killed and she has been captured by the enemy. She must find a way to escape, or the enemy will hurt her.

 I was pleasantly surprised to see this film on TV a couple of nights ago. I haven't seen the book, but the movie was very entertaining. I think it would have been better with a bit more depth, but overall it was a good movie. The acting was excellent, especially the work of the young kids. A bit of a shame that so much of the film was about the dad's attempts to get the kids to say the word "naughty". I'm not sure how much effect that has on the kids (I don't think it's a very effective way of getting kids to act naughty), but it was a good effort nonetheless. I also liked the ending. It was very cute. I think the little girl was a bit annoying with her constant need for attention, but generally it was a very cute film.

<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />The one thing that I think could have been done better was the ending. I think that there could have been a bit more depth to the ending. Although the idea of showing the stories of the different kids was a good idea, it was really just an excuse to have a happy ending. I think more could have been
 I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and I spent the entire time comparing it to the movie "Manos: The Hands of Fate". I thought it was very good, but not as good as Manos. Here are a few differences: "The Wizard of Speed and Time" is a much better movie. The acting is much better, the story is better, the special effects are better and the movie is better paced. The movie has no silly out of place scene where it just stops for no reason. Also, the movie does not take itself seriously which is a big difference. The final scene of the movie is just amazing. It is like a painting come to life. The movie is also very funny, but not as funny as Manos. The story starts out with a man named Milo who is stuck in a bad marriage. His wife is a bit of a bimbo and is always nagging him. He is always late for work and has no real friends. He is treated as a slave in his home. One night while he is in bed, he hears a knock on his door. He opens the door to find a beautiful girl. She claims to be a witch. She gives him a magic wand
 I'd like to know if anyone has seen this movie, if so what do you think of it?<br /><br />I've only seen a few minutes of it, but it seems to have a great story. I'm very interested in seeing more of this movie, and I'd like to know if you guys have seen it.<br /><br />Hey, I'm not trying to sound like a jerk; I just want to know if anyone has seen it, and if so, what you think of it.<br /><br />Good luck to you.

"Tenochtitlan" is an excellent mix of comedy and drama, and is a great movie for anyone who loves this genre of movies, or just loves to watch a great movie.

<br /><br />I give "Tenochtitlan" an 8 out of 10. Great movie, great story.

I'd like to see this movie, but I don't know where to find it.

Anyone know where to find it?

<br /><br />If you're interested, tell me where to find "Tenochtitlan" and how much you've seen it.
 When I first saw this movie it was in the mid-90's and I was completely blown away. I also saw it a few years ago and was just as impressed. I was in the 6th grade during this time period and loved pretty much all of my teachers.<br /><br />I watched this movie for the first time in the early 2000's and it had become somewhat of a lost classic that I had never seen. It's not just the storyline, but the way that the story is told is just amazing.<br /><br />I believe that this movie is an excellent example of how great movies should be done. The fact that this movie is so underrated is a great shame. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever watched and I hope that one day it is recognized for what it is.

 I watched this film a few weeks ago and I still think about it. It's an amazing film, not only because of the story, but because of the cinematography. The cinematography is incredible and the way the camera moves through the house and around the characters is brilliant. You can't help but be drawn into the film, feeling like you're actually there. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good, twisty, and well made film.

 This movie is absolutely great. I would recommend it for anyone who has not seen it. I found it to be very entertaining and very thought provoking. It is a movie that is just as much about the society in which we are today (if not more so) as it is about the people in the movie. I think that the movie is a very good reflection of the human condition and one cannot help but come away with a sense of sadness when one sees the things that the people in the movie have to go through. It is an extremely powerful movie, and if people are to begin to understand compassion, tolerance and forgiveness, they should see this movie. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and I have never lost interest in it. It is a movie that everyone should see.

It's Still a Great Movie But Not For Everybody.

I really liked the movie. I thought it was very original, thought provoking and well acted. I am sure that a few people out there will not enjoy this movie because of the story
 The first Academy Award winner for Best Short Subject, this is a fun and fairly engrossing story about a rat who sets out on a quest to find his master. The animation is great, and the story is very simple and easy to follow. There are some great bits of humor and the character of the rat is very much likeable. This cartoon was made from 1927-1929, and it is a great piece of animation. The Disney studio was only making two minute cartoons at this time, and this is a great example of their work. This cartoon won the Special Oscar for "Best Animated Short Subject in 1928." This is a great cartoon to watch, and it is definitely worth watching.

 I had never seen anything like this before and I must say i was blown away. The soundtrack is incredible, the animation is outstanding and the story is gripping. The characters are all very deep and very believable. The whole thing is quite simply amazing and I'm looking forward to seeing more of the series. I would recommend this to everyone, all ages, all tastes and all levels of understanding. I have seen a lot of anime in the past and have seen some of the best and some of the worst, this is in every way the best. I have watched the whole series now and I have got many things to say about it. The thing that has impressed me the most is the range of emotions that the characters go through and the depth and complexity of the characters. The way they interact and deal with each other. The way that the story develops. The way that the music is used. The animation. There is nothing that I can fault about it. It is a film that is stunning and if you have never seen it before and you are looking for something to watch, this is a must.

A good film for the old and young

Author: cbhowe from New Zealand

22 January 2004



The film is an interesting retelling of the actual events and situation of the real life incident that happened on the island of Barbuda. The film is a little different to the original Staw Dogs in that there is more emphasis on the relationship between the two main characters, the plot is a little more complex and there is a good deal more about the dynamics of the relationship between the two characters. The film is also a little more mature
 This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is totally original, but also really "modern" in a lot of ways. It's sort of like a sci-fi movie that's about people's lives. The character of Sissy Spacek is probably without equal in any role she has ever played. She is absolutely haunting, but not in a scary way, just a way that makes you feel sad for her. The two main characters are both wonderful, but I think that it's the girl that plays the sister who is my favorite. She is so real and totally believable in every way. You really feel for this character and for her tragic life. All of her actions are justifiable. I feel that the director did the character of her mother extremely well, too. She is just so horrible and so real that you can't help but feel sick at the sight of her. She is a lot like my own mother, and I have always wondered if she would have done things differently if she had had a chance to think about the things her mother did. If she had had the chance to think about all the wonderful things that she did, she might have thought about the bad things she did too. The direction is really
 I went to see this movie with some trepidation, I had heard the bad reviews and I was worried. But I was so happy I went. The movie was so beautifully done. The cinematography was stunning, the actors were terrific and the story was surprisingly touching. There was a lot of humor and it was well written. I loved it. I hope they make more movies like this. I would go see it again.

 This movie had the right idea. It showed the 'good' guys that are trying to save the environment and stop the bad guys, who are polluting the earth, and also had a good story line. It was a bit slow at the beginning, but once it got going, it was really good. It was also really funny and had lots of action and suspense. It was also really cool that it was about the environment, and how it is being destroyed by the bad guys that are polluting the earth. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a must see, and if you haven't seen it, you should.

 This film is a candy. A sweet, sweet candy that is hard to find and is rarely found at a bargain price. A fine classical film, the way they used to make them. So much fine detail in the sets and costumes and such. The camera work is wonderful. The story could have been better but it is so well done that I don't really care. The acting, the music, the cinematography and the sets are all perfect. Well done.

7/10

PS. I especially like the man who played the captain of the boat and the man who played the doctor. Both had great facial expressions and their acting was very convincing.

PSS. I also like the way the captain of the boat's hair was all messed up. It was a very French way to be.

PSSS. I really liked the captain of the boat's monocle.

PSSSS. I also loved the way the hero, who was dressed up like the captain of the boat, was killed.

PSSSSS. I also like the way the woman was killed. She was held at gunpoint and shot in the head. It was a very French way to be.

 A really good movie. The storyline is great. It's so different from most other movies. Basically, I liked it. I give it 7 out of 10.

 PBS's first attempt at a television series based around the book. The story was too predictable and the characters were not as developed as in the book and the TV series. The cast was excellent and I loved all the actors, especially Bruce Davison. His character Mr. Krebbs was so believable and the little boy actor was so good.

I thought the show was just okay. I found the ending a bit disappointing and I was just not that interested in the show.

I give it a 4 out of 10.

 This is the best movie I've ever seen....I'm in my 30's and this is the first movie that has ever made me cry. It is extremely well written and directed and is a must see if you're into movies. It is definately not for children though.

I'm not sure how to rate this movie because I'm not sure if it's exactly a comedy or drama. I will say, however, that if you go into the movie expecting a typical comedy you won't be happy. This is a very serious movie and the plot is a little hard to follow at times. It is very intense and the characters do a great job of portraying a range of emotions. I highly recommend this movie.

10/10

P.S. I'd always heard that this movie was an adaptation of the book "A Separate Peace" by John Knowles. I've never read the book, so I can't tell you if it is or isn't. I just thought it was worth mentioning.

The fourth is as good as the second, if not better. I can't wait for the fifth movie to be made.<br /><br />The book series is amazing! The movies are great! The books are even better!

 I thought this film was very well done and I'm not sure why the critics didn't like it. The cast is excellent and the story is excellent. The dialogue between the characters is believable and it has a good pace. The only complaint I have is that I wish the movie had been longer. The movie is very much in the mold of a Stephen King novel and I think it would have been a lot better if they had kept the story going longer. This is a good movie to watch with a group of friends to discuss.

 I saw this film in the early eighties in a little art house in the San Fernando Valley. It showed up in the middle of a documentary about the French New Wave and the first half of it was a documentary about the making of "La Haine". I loved that movie and was surprised to see a new version of it coming out in the theaters. What I didn't know until I saw the film was that there was a French version of it called "L'envie de chier" (roughly translated "The Lust for Piss"). The American version was only a remake of the first half of the French version. The American version was much shorter than the French version and the whole thing was very fast paced and frantic. The American version of "La Haine" was a lot more violent than the French version. The American version was not as well made as the French version. The American version of "La Haine" was also made by Jean-Paul Le Chanois who made the "Barbarella" movie. The French version of "La Haine" was made by Jean-Marie Poiré who also made "Barbarella" and "The Star Maker" (the movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger is
 This is the second time I've seen this movie, and it was a very enjoyable experience. I was there when it opened, and it was cool to see how it was received, and how it has developed into a cult favorite. I think it's a great movie. One of the best parts is that you don't need a bunch of special effects to get the point across. The point is simple: Humans are not that different from animals. We are all in the same boat, and we all have the same needs. One person's monster is another's hero. And the actors in the movie are great, especially the animals. The scene where the dolphin bites off a man's leg is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It's pretty damn chilling. There are some great scenes that are just funny, like when the dog is sitting on the toilet. The director does a great job at making the scenes funny, without making it seem out of place. And the ending is just awesome. It's really worth seeing this movie.

The Usual Suspects

***SPOILERS***

I really don't know how to start this review.
 A great movie. If you can get past the extremely slow pace, this is a great movie, with a great story. Billy Bob Thornton and John Goodman are great, and a supporting cast that includes Mercedes Ruehl and John Glover. My only criticism is that although there are many great scenes, the constant swimming and running made it a bit boring. But if you can get past the pacing, which is extremely slow and boring, this is a great movie.

As a novelist, I sometimes have a tendency to over analyze things. Like the ending. I don't think the ending was necessarily the best, but it was not the worst. I do feel that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to have seen a bit more resolution, and to have seen a bit more of the aftermath. But, I have to admit, it was not a bad ending.

I am giving this movie an 8. It was a good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

 I saw this film at the Village art cinema in Chicago in the late 80's, and I remember how much I enjoyed it. I think the play is better, but the movie has the advantage of a script and direction. The movie is not perfect. It is a bit slow and the characters are not as well drawn as the play, but that's the nature of the beast. It doesn't really matter what you think of the characters. I like them, but I don't always agree with the choices they make. They are not always perfect, nor are the situations. More often, the film is a reflection of human nature, and the characters and situations are recognizable. If you can suspend your disbelief and just let it roll, it's a good film, and you'll enjoy it.

 I think that this movie is one of the best movies ever. I have seen it about ten or twelve times, but never get tired of it. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and never get bored. And the people in it are so cute. The way Rosalind Russell's character, Miss Russell, talks is so cute! I think that it is better than the "Bridget Jones" movies. If you haven't seen this movie, then you should.

 I don't think it's possible to describe how much I enjoyed this film. It's a great combination of humor, emotion, and truly great acting. No one is perfect, but this film does a wonderful job showing that we all have our own imperfections. Such a wonderful movie for all ages and for couples alike. I was so impressed with how beautifully this movie was made, that I bought the DVD. I can't wait for it to come out on video!

I was SO disappointed with this sequel. It wasn't close to as funny as the first one. It was just a painful experience. It was just totally predictable too. It seemed to drag on and on. The acting was just awful too. This is one of the few times I've ever stopped watching a film because it was so bad. All in all, just a total let down.

 Based on a true story, this film is about four adults, who, by chance, meet on a flight to Los Angeles, and who change each other's lives forever.<br /><br />The four people are a forty-year-old divorcee, who is a struggling actor, a twenty-three year-old aspiring writer and producer, a thirty-year-old assistant director, and a forty-year-old woman who is an aging actress. The four people are each in love with one of the other three, but, at the same time, wants to be in love with the other three.<br /><br />The film is a little slow to start, with the four people spending a lot of time getting to know each other and getting to know the other people in their lives. The film is also a little confusing, with a good deal of flashbacks, and odd events and situations, that don't seem to really fit into the story. And, since the film is based on a true story, there are a lot of gaps in the story.<br /><br />But, by the end of the film, all of these things seem to work, and the movie comes together nicely, and is a
 A brilliant, terrifying story of a man's descent into madness - and his terror of the very society that seems determined to keep him locked in. Arguably one of the best films of the last decade, David Lynch's "Eraserhead" is a dark, disturbing, beautiful and at times disturbing spectacle. It is a tale of the dangers of technology, of an ill-fated relationship between a man and a woman, of a community that seems unaware of it's effect on the individual, and of an ever present sense of impending doom. It is a film that has it's roots in the great German Expressionism of the 30's and 40's, but manages to be completely unique in it's presentation. The film is a tribute to the art of film, and it's a film that you have to see.

David Lynch is a very unique director. His films are a triumph of style over substance - and that is a good thing. If a director is only concerned with style, then he will be able to show all the best elements of a movie, but if you can't make a film that's just all about the story, then you're not going to be able to create much of a film to begin
 This is a quirky little flick that was enjoyable. Not the most intelligent film around, but it has enough sexual innuendo to please even the most prudish. The plot is sort of a "Who's the daddy?" type of thing, but the film is not overly serious or complicated. It's a low-budget attempt to make a splash, and it does. It's got a lot of charm, and the actors are pretty good. It's nice to see a film where the girls are not all brainless bimbos, and there are some pretty good dialog scenes. The characters are quirky and often very amusing, and the young woman playing the part of the high school "princess" is a scream. I enjoyed this film, and it's well worth a rental.

***SPOILERS*** There are some really great scenes here, but I do have some issues with the film. The characters, while interesting, are a bit too cartoonish, and it almost seems like they are just created to get the plot going.

 I was surprised at the high ratings this show got on IMDb; there are very few reviews and they are all on the positive side. I saw the show live in 2003 and really enjoyed it. The music was fun and the story was interesting and funny. I thought the actors played their parts well, and they were all great musicians. The story was not predictable and the comedy was very good. I saw a preview for a new series called "The Big Bang Theory" and saw some of the actors from this show; I am sure I will give that show a try too.

funny and fun to watch

I saw this show on TV in 2003. It was at the time when I didn't have cable. I saw the first episode on TV and then went to see the rest of the season. I thought the show was very funny and entertaining. I used to love sitcoms and this show is in the same category. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 10 is because when I watched it on TV, it was very well done, but now that it is on DVD
 This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It has a unique, dark, and slightly perverse yet very human story. The acting is phenomenal and the writing is incredible. The camera work is perfect, the music is wonderful, and the editing is flawless. <br /><br />This movie has many levels and twists, and it is very well paced. It is not a movie you see once or twice and forget. You must see it at least 3 or 4 times to appreciate it. If you love dark, twisted, strange stories, this is the movie for you. If you like dark, twisted, strange stories, this is the movie for you. If you like dark, twisted, strange stories, this is the movie for you. If you like dark, twisted, strange stories, this is the movie for you.

 This movie is a riot. Richard Pryor is a riot. This movie is a riot. With all the uproar about this film, I was surprised to see I was the only one who had actually seen it. I have not seen it since the day I first saw it. I watched it on cable and recorded it. I like to call it a cult film. It is one of the best cultural films of all time. I know it's not that great of a film, but I thought it was a riot.

I love Richard Pryor. He was my favorite comedian until I seen the movie. It changed my mind about him. I thought he was one of the best comedians of all time. But he was not as funny in this film. He at least had the same sense of humor in it. I mean, I'm not going to say he was bad. He's still one of the funniest comedians. I just think that he was more funny in other films.

I recommend this film to any Richard Pryor fans. It's a little slow, but the reason it's slow is because of all the comedy. And it's a riot.

 Wow. This is one of the best films I've seen in years. The characters are so well written and the scenery is so beautiful. The way the movie moves from scene to scene is incredible. I was completely captivated from start to finish and I will probably see it again. If you've seen it and are interested in seeing it again, you might want to rent the DVD by the way. Don't expect the same movie when you see it again. The DVD has a different ending. (SPOILER ALERT) I was really upset that the end was changed. But I understand why. I wish it had ended the way the original script did. However, I do think the film is better with the added ending. It took away a bit of the mystery of the movie and made it seem less mature. However, it is still a great film and I would recommend it to anyone.

<br /><br />The film stars one of the best actors ever, Sam Shepard. He plays a middle aged guy who has been married for a long time. He and his wife have a daughter who is about to be married. The wedding is supposed to be on a beach with a bunch of people from the town.
 This is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I've never been a fan of horror movies, but this one was so well made, that I decided to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />First, this is one of the most original horror movies ever made. The film is about a group of teenagers who are given a "curse" by a voodoo priestess. They are told that if they break a voodoo doll, they will die. They aren't told why, but it is implied that it is because the doll comes to life. They also are not told that if they break the voodoo doll, a woman will die. And that is the first thing that happens to them as they discover the curse. But the movie doesn't stop there, there is also a second part to the story. The second part is that the curse causes a lot of people to die, and they all have a connection to the voodoo doll. The movie keeps you guessing through the entire story. I personally never would have guessed how it ended.<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the acting. The only thing I really didn't like was how the characters didn't
 I saw this movie when it was new and it has been one of my favorites ever since. It is a really fun movie and the actors are really talented. It is also really funny, and the story is good. It is set in the future, and there are some really cool things about it. I think that this movie is really great for people of all ages, and I think that even people who aren't interested in acting will like it just because of the acting. I would definitely recommend this movie, and I think that you should see this movie.

 This is a lovely, lovely film. For those of you who haven't experienced the joys of the original 'West Side Story' would I urge you to go and watch it. This is the film I was always supposed to grow up and watch, but I never did. My sister and I were always arguing over who should get the part of Maria (my sister always got the role of Anita) and whether Sean should get to sing instead of Riff, but I finally watched it this weekend. I must say, I enjoyed it. I was never a big fan of the original, but I suppose it's not the same as seeing it for the first time. I also must say, I was never a fan of Anita, I always thought she was a bit Mary Sue-ish. But as Maria, my sister does a wonderful job. She is truly a beautiful actress. The first time I saw her in this role I was amazed by her ability to really make me believe that she was Maria, the kind and loving girl from the Bronx. I was also amazed by her ability to sing the role of Maria. I was expecting her to end up being completely out of key and singing the wrong lyrics, but she sings it perfectly.
 This is a wonderful comedy that my husband and I saw on the big screen and we both laughed so hard! It's so funny! The characters are all great, it's so funny, and the music is wonderful. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to sit down and have a good time! It's a very wholesome movie that you won't be able to take your eyes off of!

 In the late ''80s and early '90s, I watched a lot of ''60s and ''70s TV shows and movies (mostly on VHS). I got through most of the tapes in my very large collection, but almost all of them, I eventually lost. They were tapes that I had either taped off the air or tapes that I had inherited from relatives. Anyway, I had been trying to find the original airing of ''The Twilight Zone'' and found that it had been released on DVD. I was very happy and surprised to find that it was a near-perfect copy of the original. As a kid, I had watched a lot of the original episodes on TV and watched them again on VHS and, later, DVD. But, the original shows are all missing from the DVD releases. Now here's ''The Twilight Zone'' restored and remastered in 5.1 surround. I found that ''The Twilight Zone'' had been released on DVD on two separate occasions. The first release was on DVD-R and it was a fine copy with no noticeable flaws. The second release was on DVD-9 and it was just a fine copy. But I was very upset to find that the DVD-R was completely
 I watched this last night - I HAVE to agree with all the previous comments. This is a very moving, emotional, beautiful film - a film that is not only about the war, but about human relationships, about love, about hope, about sacrifice, about death, about life and about life-and-death choices. In a little over two hours, we see a string of memorable, memorable moments - the way a young girl, with a long life ahead of her, slowly, bit by bit, realizes that her father is dead. The way the young boy, who has lost his father and his brother, struggles to understand what is going on. The way the old man, who has lost everything and everyone, slowly, gradually, comes to terms with it and decides to go on. The way the old man, who has lost his family, suddenly, with a kind of desperate, desperate hope, decides to go on and try to find his brother. The way, in between, the young girl, who has lost her mother and her father, decides to go on. The way the young boy, who has lost his brothers, his father, his mother and his sister, decides to go on. The way the young girl,
 I've read the book, seen the movie, and read the book again. I've decided that the movie is not an adaptation of the book, but rather a revision of the book.<br /><br />This is a pure love story. It's a joy to watch. The story is simply told, and is as gripping as it is simple. As far as the book goes, I always felt that the character of Cary Elwes, who plays the lead, "Pete" was too much of a caricature of the book's "Stacey" and too little the character I came to know.<br /><br />It's been 15 years since the movie came out, and I still think of the movie and the book as entirely distinct entities. The movie is a wonderful love story, full of surprises, joy, and pathos. The book is romantic, and at times a little sentimental, but it also has a sense of humor. The movie is laugh out loud funny, while the book is full of laugh out loud moments. The movie is also dark and a little sad, while the book is entirely uplifting and full of hope. <br /><br />When I first saw the movie, I thought
 I thought this was an excellent film. It is true to the story of the book, but it adds many new things that were not in the book. It has a very good cast, the acting is superb. The music is excellent, and the cinematography is very good. The story is very good, and it is done very well. This is a film, that I think should be shown in all schools to learn about the Holocaust. It shows what the world was like during the war, and it shows that it can happen again. It shows that there are people out there who will do anything to keep their people from learning about the Holocaust. This is a very good film, and should be studied in schools. I give it a 10 out of 10.

7 out of 10.

P.S.: I hope everyone will do their best to try to keep the Holocaust from happening again.

 If a work of art was a person, then the movie "Bowling for Columbine" would be the most introspective, analytical, and painfully honest person you have ever had the misfortune to meet. Michael Moore, who made this film, is to me, what a psychiatrist would be to a psychotherapy patient. He doesn't just make a movie, he dissects the very essence of America. To me, it is the greatest anti-war movie ever made. The techniques of "the man behind the curtain" are used to show the viewer how the media, the government, and the non-profit organizations have influenced the minds of the people to make them accept a war that they should not be supporting. This movie is not an anti-war movie, it is an anti-everything movie. "Bowling for Columbine" lays the blame on the shoulders of the media and the American people. This is not a good thing for the American people to hear, but it is the truth of what has happened in the last 15 years in America. If you want to find out what the media is hiding from you, or why the government has your back, or what non-profit organizations have your money, then this is a movie
 I know that this movie has been hated by many people, and there is a valid reason for that. However, I must say that I enjoyed it. I think it's because I haven't seen too many movies with a storyline like this one. I mean, we've seen movies with the typical romantic story, but this one is much different. It's very unusual, is it not? The movie doesn't show how the story develops, it just shows how the characters develop. It may seem like a cliché, but I think it's a very good idea. The characters are very well drawn, and I could connect with them. I think it's because the movie doesn't show us all the details of the story, it just throws us into this world, and then we're able to decide for ourselves whether we like it or not.

The storyline is good, but, it's not the best one. I think it's because, again, the movie doesn't show us everything. But still, it's my favourite movie because it's very different from all the other movies I've seen.

I recommend it, but you have to be brave and open-minded.

 This is a good movie, but it's not a good musical. It doesn't have the musical numbers that are in all the other movies, and it doesn't have the drama of singing and dancing. We don't get to see the songs performed, and they're not sung by the actors. We just see the characters singing, and it's not a big deal. But the movie itself is still a good movie because you get to see a lot of dancing and a lot of singing. The music is great, and the dancing is very good. I think it's the best dancing you would ever see on a movie. The dancing is really good, so it's worth seeing. If you like the dancing, you should like this movie.

Now, this is not a good musical. If you like good musicals, you might not like this one. It's just not a good musical. But it is a good movie, so it's worth watching.

I give it a 7 out of 10 because it's not a good musical, and the dancing was good, but not good enough to be a great movie.

By the way, the actors didn't get along too well with each other. They were
 This film is a true hidden gem. It is a wonderful film about a family in the early 1900's on a farm in the South. The family is poor, but happy. Then, the father gets sick and the family has to make a choice, sell the farm and move or try to stay and save the farm. The family takes the latter path and they try to find a way to continue the farm. Then, the father dies and the family is forced to move on. The film is wonderful and the cast is great. The daughter is played by the same actress who plays the mother in the film. The other actors are also great. The film is very moving and uplifting. It is a great family film that is well worth seeing.

3.0 out of 5 stars Very Good but a little slow... Format: DVD | Verified Purchase I loved the fact that there was no music playing in the background for the film. The film seemed to be more about the characters and their lives then about the music. It was about a family that lived on a farm in the south. There father was a doctor and the mother was a nurse. They had a daughter, a son, and a maid. It seemed that the
 This movie is excellent, and I don't care how old you are. I love this movie. It is one of my favorite movies. It has a wonderful storyline, and the acting is great. I love how it shows them as teenagers. I love how it shows the really bad things that happened to them. I love the happy ending and the fact that they finally got to be a family. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone. and if you haven't seen it, you should. It is a great movie.

The story is about a young girl, who after being sexually abused by her father, with the help of a psychotherapist and a new friend, decides to take revenge on her father and his wife.

Dvd Verdict Review of 'Cruel Intentions'

Cruel Intentions is the story of a young girl, who after being sexually abused by her father, with the help of a psychotherapist and a new friend, decides to take revenge on her father and his wife. Reese Witherspoon is brilliant in this movie.
 I first saw this movie at the age of 11 and it stuck with me for 20 years. I still think it is the best movie I have ever seen, the acting, script and the music all make this movie a masterpiece. The scene where the kids are playing and singing "I got rhythm" and the guy from the band comes along and says "I got rhythm" is just so funny and makes me laugh. I think it is also a good movie because it is unique and not like other movies. It shows how other people see you and how they treat you.This is my favourite movie of all time and I hope I will be able to see it again one day on DVD.

The movie is just amazing and even though I've seen it in the cinema, I've never seen it on video. I still think that it is a great movie and I'm glad I own the video version of it. I am a huge fan of John Cusack and I think he is an amazing actor and this movie proves it. I love the fact that the kids in the film are really funny, it really makes you laugh and I think
 I just recently got the game, which was surprisingly cheap, and I have to say that I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The game is fast and furious, and the combat as you can tell from the title is very similar to the ones in Tekken. The story for this game is just as crazy as the story in Tekken and I found myself laughing at some of the characters. The voices are good, but I wish that some of the voice actors would voice a bit different. Overall, the game is good, but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. It is for those who have played other fighting games, and like them.

 I've seen this film a few times and I think it's great! I found it to be a very well-done thriller, so I wonder why there aren't more people who had seen it.<br /><br />The film follows a group of people who are trying to find the person responsible for killing a local police officer. They are led by a cop who feels responsible for the death, and the film focuses on the relationships of the characters and the relationships between the characters. There are some great moments in this film.<br /><br />Tarantino has done a great job with this film, and I hope he continues to do more films like this.

I loved this movie. I usually don't like movies about cops, but this was awesome. I never thought I would like a movie about a cop, but not only did I like it, I loved it. It had some really good acting. I would recommend this to anyone. Quentin Tarantino really did a great job.

 I don't know why he didn't just call it "The Other Side of the Door". It's still a good movie.<br /><br />I saw this in a theater when it first came out, and I was just blown away. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it! I've rented it countless times since then, and I finally bought it on DVD. I will always keep it in my collection.

 I was waiting for this to come out on DVD, so I could see it with friends. It's a simple story, but some great acting. The basic premise is that a young woman that would have any man she wanted has decided to go out on her own after graduating, and is trying to have some fun. However, all of the men she meets are gay, and she finds herself falling for one of them. It's a charming story, and I wouldn't mind seeing more from this director.

3/4 ... I like it

I didn't know anything about this movie when I first watched it, but I was instantly hooked. It tells a simple story of commitment, finding what you want and being happy with it. The directing is great and the characters are well drawn. I think this is a great story for a young teen to see, or a young adult or young gay man in the audience.

 I've seen this film before and recall being blown away by it. I didn't watch it again for years until I saw it on TV. I must say that despite what others have said, I found the film to be quite boring, I must have been in a terrible mood that day. So, when I found the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart, I thought I'd give it a try. I was surprised to find that the story line was not as dry as I remembered, and that this film was about a young man who's life was going nowhere. I found it to be well shot and acted, and enjoyed the way the film was shot, it clearly shows a lot of talent. I must say that I liked the ending a lot better than I remembered. I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would. So, I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes a good story, or anyone who wants to see a good movie.

 I saw this film on TV recently and loved it. I found the movie to be very funny and clever. I was laughing all the way through it without having expected it to be funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is feeling down and could do with a laugh.

2.0 out of 5 stars A bit of a mind blower!! Format: DVD | Verified Purchase The premise of this movie is that it is an hour long one-act play taken from a novel by JG Ballard. The play has a strange structure and is filmed in a strange way. The cast is a strange mix of actors with some of them playing multiple roles. The plot is bizarre and it is hard to understand at first as to what is actually happening. At first I thought it was a kind of a surrealistic version of "Blow up" but then I realised that it was actually a homage to L'etat de Siege (the French film version of "L'etat de Siege")!! The man who is the main character (Dan) is a suicidal poet and he is trying to write a new novel about his life. The camera work is a bit shaky and it is hard to follow the plot because you don
 I just love this movie. It is not just a simple love story or a film about a single event in the life of two people. It has a lot more to it. The story is not only about love, but also about the relationship between the two people. The two main characters were both very strong personalities. They had their own way of thinking and therefore, their own way of handling the situation. The story was very well told and the main characters were just perfect for their roles. The film was very well shot and photographed. Especially the scenes at the wedding were particularly good. The music and the sound was good too. I loved this film and I would even say that it is worth watching just to see the wedding scene.

 "The Last Detail" is a story about Naval officers. They are assigned to a ship and sail to the coast of Vietnam. One of them (Daly) has to pick up a drunk and stoned sailor (Harrelson) and take him back to the ship. They take him around to a few of the military bases, but no one will help the young sailor, so they finally decide to take him back to the ship that he came from. The two of them get along fairly well and have a few laughs on the way. The trip is not as fun for the older man, as his own son is in Vietnam and is fighting for freedom. The film is made very well and is a very entertaining movie. Richard Dreyfuss and Jack Nicholson are also great in this movie.

 I have been a fan of the first two seasons of "The Shield" so I was eager to watch this third season with many of the same actors. I will say that I enjoyed this season more than the first two. The first two were really good but this one was more realistic and had more depth. I am a big fan of the fact that the show was based on a true story and that most of the characters were real life people. That is a rare thing to find in a TV show. It was interesting to see how the characters evolved during the third season. I found the season to be more dramatic and the acting was strong. I really enjoyed the scenes where the characters really were going through real life problems. The actors have matured and we have become more aware of the real world that they are living in. I also think that the writers have learned from the first two seasons and have refined the story line. There are many twists and turns in this season and I especially liked the scenes in the jail. I have been a fan of this show from the beginning and I am looking forward to the fourth season.

I rate this show a 10.

 I bought this movie for my husband who is a big fan of Louis Prima. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great musical comedy. The movie is set in the late 1940's, the decade of the big band era. Louis Prima is at the top of his career. He is a great musician, singer, dancer and entertainer. He is also a ladies man. The movie is a musical comedy which takes place in a restaurant where the band is playing and Louis is singing and dancing. The movie is fast-paced and very funny. You will have a lot of fun watching it. It is a great movie for all ages. I think it would be a fun movie to watch if you were throwing a party and wanted something different.

 I just finished watching this movie again, and I don't understand why it wasn't a bigger hit. What I loved about it was how the movie played out. A lot of movies today have their story all mapped out in advance, and this movie didn't have that problem. The characters were interesting and unique. My favorite character was definitely Frank. I could relate to him and his love for his daughter so much. This is why I love movies, they make you feel something it's always a good thing. I also enjoyed seeing the father/daughter relationship grow and change. I was crying before the movie even ended, it was so good. This movie is definitely worth watching, the acting, the story, and the directing were all exceptional. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good drama.

 I first saw this film when I was a teenager in the 70s, and the memories of that time are very strong. I saw it again a few years ago, and the memories came flooding back. I believe this was the first film that really made an impact on me, and the first that really got me thinking about the subjects it was covering. I also think that it is a very good film, and well worth seeing if you can find it. The characters are well drawn, and the story is a good one. The atmosphere of the film is very strong, and the story is a compelling one. The performances are very good, and the direction is very good. I thought that the music was very good, and that the scenes of the kids playing football and playing pranks on each other were great. I also liked the way the film ended. It was very atmospheric, and well done. There are some very strong themes in the film, and it has some very strong social messages. This is a very good film, and well worth seeing.

 This is a charming film, for sure. The performances are first-rate, particularly from John Cusack and John Mahoney, who are absolutely hilarious. But what really makes this film work is the subtle way in which it's shot. It's a very, very artful film, and it really shows with the way it's shot. It's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and the way it's edited is amazing. It's one of the most underrated films of the 90s.

 There are many times when I feel duped by the people who have created the "A" list, but I have to admit that this time I was very impressed. The A list people did a great job at portraying a real life event in a way that gives it a sense of familiarity and reality. The acting was very realistic, and the story was very gripping. The movie made me feel like I was watching the events of the actual event unfold for real. I mean, it's obvious that the movie was not meant to be anything but a fictional portrayal of a real event, but it was still very entertaining. I think that the movie should be studied by film schools in order to inspire future directors. This is a great movie and should be watched by anyone who wants a good movie to watch.

 I don't know why this movie's rating is so low. I've seen it several times and all I can say is that it's a very good, well-made movie that is largely forgotten. I think people have forgotten it because they are so used to the other, less interesting movies that have gained more popularity. I don't know if it's because the ending wasn't happy, but it was a good and intriguing movie. I think it's a must-see.

I first saw this movie when I was a child of six or seven. I was home alone and I don't know why but I just watched it and I really liked it. It was so different from the usual children's movies that were made at that time. It's about a girl who is about to lose her family's restaurant. She has to find a way to save it and the family. This story is told in flashback. The girl remembers how the story started and what happened. She doesn't think she can do it, but she hears a voice that tells her that she is gonna make it. And she does. I think it's a good thing that this movie was made because books are really boring and have such a good storyline.
 I think this is a very fine film with an interesting story. Why is it that some people can see such things as angels in a tree and a large shadowy figure in an attic, while others can't? It depends on the person's state of mind. I liked the way the story unfolded, and it was very well done. I was very surprised when the little girl died, and even more surprised by the way her mother acted at the end. I had no idea that she would take the police and the social workers so seriously. It was a very sad way for her to die. I also liked the way the little girl's father reacted to the death. He seemed to be happy that the little girl was gone, and he didn't seem to blame himself for the death. This was a good mystery, and I thought the ending was very satisfying. I will recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I believe that this film is going to be re-released on video, and so I hope that the story will be expanded on in a sequel.

The ending:

I do not know if this will be explained in a sequel, or if it is explained in the film, but the little girl's

 I enjoyed this film. It was not overly predictable, as some other films are that are based on true events. It didn't have the stereotypical 'hero' that most other films do. The characters were well developed and the plot was believable. I actually thought the movie was going to be about a kidnapping but it was about a murder and the police investigation. The only thing I wished was that I could have been in the film and watched it. I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall during the investigation and the trial. I do think the movie was a little long. I would have liked to have seen more of the investigation and less of the trial. I did think it was an interesting story and it kept my interest the whole way through. I think the kids should enjoy it and I'm sure they will.

 A man must struggle with an enormous debt and an even more enormous fear. It is a solid film with a great cast. The music is terrific and the mood throughout is well managed. There is a great deal of humor and the drama is well done. I have seen the film twice and plan to see it again.

I was dissappointed by the lack of sex. I was expecting a Woody Allen inspired romantic comedy, but it was extremely clean. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a well ended drama.

 This movie is a true classic. It is one of those films that you can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It has a wonderful cast, wonderful acting, and a wonderful story. The acting is by far the best part of this movie. The acting is so interesting and believable. I also loved the story. It is so good and so interesting. I could watch this movie over and over again. I also loved the setting. It is so good and so interesting. I love to watch movies in the middle of the night. One of the best uses of a movie is seeing it at night. The movie is so good that you do not want to miss a second of it. The only thing that I did not like about the movie was that it was not a little bit longer. Some movies that are only about an hour and a half are not good enough to watch over and over. This movie is very good, and I suggest that you watch it. It is one of the best movies ever.

 A very impressive, if not exactly original, film. The plot is a very simple one, but is undeniably effective. The film follows the rise of a young man from the slums to the heights of the fashion world. It has a very clear message about how hard work and ambition can overcome everything, and what sacrifices you have to make in order to achieve any goal. It's a very uplifting message, and the film is a joy to watch. The cast is excellent too. It has a very diverse range of roles, and all of the actors seem to be enjoying themselves. The film is very stylish and modern, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The music is also very stylish, and the soundtrack is a great collection of songs. It is a shame that the film has such a simple plot, since it does leave a lot to be desired. However, the film has a great message, and is highly recommended for anyone looking for a film with a great message.

'The Empire Strikes Back' is one of the best of the Star Wars saga. It's not as good as the first (the original) but it is still very good. This is the first of the trilogy and it's set up brilliantly. The plot is great, with the Jedi and the dark lord fighting for control of the galaxy. The acting is great. Mark Hamill does a very good job, as does Ian McDiarmid. The plot is good but not as good as the first. There are a few plot holes but this is a minor problem. The special effects are great, especially the battle. The set design, costumes, and special effects make this movie look great. The pace is good
 This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's not a typical movie where you can predict everything that's going to happen. You live with the characters and the story line and you just have to go with the flow. It's a brilliant idea for a movie and I can't wait for its sequel. I think this is a movie that has to be experienced. Even though there's no nudity in the movie, the premise of a woman coming to terms with her sexuality is a subject that should not be left out. It's a great movie to see with your girlfriend, your parents, your friends or your significant other. It's a movie that you should see and I hope that you do.

 I enjoyed this movie and I wasn't expecting much. I thought this movie was an average love story until the very end. It's a light romantic comedy that has a great cast and some funny moments. I can't really say anything bad about it, unless you really hate the main characters. The main characters are very annoying but the movie's funny moments along with the cast and the story will make you want to watch it again.

I'm a big fan of that type of movies, light romantic comedies, as I'm sure you are too. I really recommend this movie to everybody. It has a great cast and a funny ending.

8/10

7 out of 10

So let's say it's a solid 8.

I give it a 7.5/10

How about you?

See it on the big screen if you can. It's so funny and the 3D is actually quite good.

See it in 3D if you can. It looks pretty good.

If you're already a fan of the movie, you might want to see it in 2D. It might be a bit boring to see it again.

 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I think it is a very funny satire of the fashion industry and the business behind fashion. I think it is also a very clever movie because of the way it shows how people are so attached to what they wear and buy. The movie is very clever and funny and I would recommend it to anyone who is a lover of fashion and just loves good quality satire.

4.0 out of 5 stars funny and fast paced Format: DVD | Verified Purchase It's a fun film, a bit like Office Space, but with a more black humour, and a different twist. The film is also very fast paced, and very funny in parts. However, the plots are a bit weak, and some parts of the film seem a bit too far fetched (especially the ending).

It's not a film that you can sit down and watch very easily, and it's not a film I would recommend to everybody. But if you are looking for a fun movie with a good message, this is probably the film for you.

 How can a film be so bad and still be so enjoyable? Well, occasionally it can if it's a spoof like "The Naked Gun" or "The Naked Gun 2". This film is a dark comedy with some dark themes in it. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, but for the most part it is funny. It's got low-brow humor and dark humor. What makes it worth watching is the plot and the characters. The plot is a basic heist structure and it doesn't get any more complex than that. The characters are the usual characters you see in heist movies and they are all pretty funny. The only character who doesn't really have any funny scenes is the lead character, who is a little too serious. Of course he has to be serious to make the comedy work, but this is one of those films where you can't help but get a kick out of it. I will say that I didn't really like this film, but I really liked it overall. The only reason I didn't give it an 8 is because I didn't really like the ending.

 I grew up in a town (South Bend, IN) where this is a famous film, but I never saw it. I watched it now and was surprised it was so good. I am a fan of the genre of zombie films and I would say this is one of the best. Its funny, and the story is great. I recommend this to everyone who is a fan of this genre.

 The end of the world is not the end of the film, as the title suggests. <br /><br />First of all, the film looks great. The colors are nice and bright, the colors and the settings look very pleasingly realistic. The special effects are actually pretty good, nothing too scary but still nice. I thought the special effects were realistic and pretty good. The acting is good, the main characters (Jennifer, Alex, and John) have great performances. Jennifer is played by a very attractive and attractive, attractive woman and she does a great job in this role. Alex is played by a very handsome man and he does a great job portraying a man going through a very difficult time in his life. The character John is played by a very good looking guy and he does a great job in this role. The acting is good, the character acting is good. <br /><br />The story is good, a man, his wife and his daughter go out to dinner, they get in an accident and the wife and daughter are killed. This is a very sad and depressing movie, but at the same time it is very realistic and very disturbing. The acting is good, the storyline is good and the acting is
 Fans of the book will be pleased to see it was well represented here. The problem is this is not a movie for everyone. In terms of the plot, the book is much more detailed, and the movie is a little sanitized. However, the acting is terrific and there are plenty of dark and mysterious moments that are quite exciting. The character of the killer is a bit different from the book, but it is still quite creepy. Overall, I would recommend this movie.

Why? Because it doesn't follow the book at all. The movie was way too short. I think they could have done a lot more to flesh out the characters, and make it much more interesting than it was. Maybe if they had done a full-length version of the movie, it would have been a lot better. But as it is, I just don't get it. If you're a fan of the book, you may want to give
 This film is superb. It is everything I wanted it to be. I never have seen a film dealing with this subject matter, and I have seen a lot. This film is more of a drama than a thriller, which I like. It is quite slow, but its still action packed. It's got the right touch of suspense and drama that makes it a great film. The acting is fantastic, and the script is just great. I love the soundtrack, too. This film says everything I've been thinking about for a long time now. It's about how people are treated for having drug addictions and what happens when a person tries to get clean. It tells the story of how drugs and alcohol can ruin a persons life. I think this film is very important for people to see because it shows a lot about addiction and how it affects people. I think it's a great film to see because it shows the story from a person who is struggling with addiction and that it's not always hopeless. It shows a lot of people and the consequences they have to face. All in all, this film is fantastic.

 I saw the trailer for this film and I was intrigued to find out more. It looks like a really interesting movie, but I wasn't sure I wanted to get my hopes up too much. I was pleasantly surprised to find it's a lot more than I expected.<br /><br />Set in a small Bavarian town, it's the story of a young girl who witnesses a murder. The murderer is a man who has a long history of beating women and killing them. The townspeople are afraid to talk about it, but this young girl is persistent, and she sets out to find out what she can about the murderer. Some of the things she finds out are shocking, but she believes she will be safe if she keeps her mouth shut about it. She's not exactly sure that the murderer is the guy who killed her mother. She finds out things that challenge her logic and make her question her beliefs. But, she's determined to solve it, and she thinks she will be safe if she stays quiet. When the local policeman tries to stop her, he ends up getting killed. Now, she's out to kill the murderer, but she doesn't know who to trust.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this
 I really enjoyed this movie. It was a very interesting, well done and well written psychological thriller. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of movie. I think it is very clever how they reveal the story at the end. I think it is also a good example of how to do a good psychological thriller. I think that Cameron Diaz, who plays the main character in this movie is very good looking and interesting. She plays a rather large role in this movie. I think she does a good job in this role. I also think that most of the people who have seen this movie have enjoyed it. I think that the movie is very well made and the story is very interesting. I also think that the movie is great for anyone who likes this genre of movie. I also think that the movie is a very good one. I think that this movie is good because it is not predictable and it is also very interesting. So if you want to see a good psychological thriller, then I would highly recommend this movie.

I also think that this movie is a good example of how to do a good psychological thriller
 I am a fan of the 80's action flicks and this one might be the best of the best. It starts off frighteningly with a slow panning scene of the Philippine jungle and then comes the awesome music. The music is so awesome that I started dancing in the living room when "Balls to the Wall" started playing. The story is a bit corny at times but it's fun and hilarious. The best scene is the scene where the bad guys use the ladies of the village as a shield by running over them with their jeeps. This movie is a must see for any action fan and it's so cheap that you'll love it.

A review of a movie that was released in the late 80's. I saw this movie when it first came out and I remember nothing about it. I don't think I've ever seen it on TV and I don't know how to find it on DVD. I just picked it up at the video store today on a whim because of the title. You've heard of it, right? The opening scene is the best action scene of all time. The music is awesome and the action is just fantastic. I
 Orson Welles gave us one of the best films ever made in "Touch of Evil" by directing and acting. Even though it is not as great as "Chimes at Midnight", it is still very good and is certainly a great movie. There are several good things about this film. First of all, the acting is superb, and there is a very good cast. Everyone is great in their roles, and I mean everyone. It includes John Huston, Janet Leigh, Charlton Heston, Orson Welles, Agnes Moorehead, and Marlene Dietrich. The story is excellent, and the special effects are great.<br /><br />"Touch of Evil" is a great film and is certainly one of the best. It is very suspenseful, and the acting is great. If you like suspenseful movies, you will love this movie.

8/10

Watch this movie if you have time to spare.

"Touch of Evil" (1958)

 During the first half of this film, I was very confused. I kept wondering what the point of the film was. I felt there were two different stories being told in this film. The first half seemed to be a story of a young girl who is trapped in a box and someone else (a woman) who comes in and opens the box to let her out. The second half of the film focused on another story, a dark story of death and madness. The two stories were very disjointed and I found myself shedding tears both times I watched this film. This film is definitely not for everyone and I would not recommend it to most viewers. I will say that the ending of this film is quite beautiful and I think it's worth seeing for that alone.

 i've been meaning to write this review for long, but those who already reviewed it gave the movie too much credit. the movie is not only disturbing, it's stupid. the gaping holes in the plot, the actors' unnatural delivery, the cheesy dialogue, the cruel themes... it's all pure kitsch. the content of the movie is what makes it so good, but to call it "good" is a bit much. it's good to see how the suburbs are depicted. but the movie has no point.<br /><br />this is a great movie if you have no other reason to watch it. it makes you think about life, about what people expect from each other, about the differences in values, about the lack of love, about the absence of the word "love" in our vocabulary, about the horror of what's living in our minds, about the fact that people don't grow up, about the fact that we're all hypocrites, about the fact that the world is filled with hypocrites, about the fact that the world sees us as it wants to see us, about the fact that we try to make everything into what we expect it to be.

 This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I love the suspense and the fact that it all happens on a sound stage. The acting is great and the story line is interesting. I'll have to admit that I totally love this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great mystery.

 A movie with a message, and a story to boot. The ending is a little off, but it is still an interesting and thought provoking film. I was very surprised when the movie turned out to be so good. I am a huge fan of both Gerard Depardieu and Jean-Paul Belmondo and I was really happy to see them together in a movie like this. If you are a fan of the French New Wave, this is a must see. It's a classic.

I give it 9 out of 10.

The movie is about a shy and lonely school boy who wants to help his teacher at his old school.

It is about loving someone, but not being able to admit it.

In a class with a bunch of kids who are the same age as him, he starts to fall in love with his teacher, but his attempts to tell him fall flat.

After the school is closed, he travels to the village where he grew up. He is much happier to be at home, but he meets some of the locals who offer him a home.

 This movie is a good adventure movie. I won't spoil it for you, but I will tell you that you won't be disappointed. The movie is full of action, but has a good story. I liked the characters, especially the young kid who is put in the middle of all of this. He is a kid who is not afraid to stand up for himself, but he gets hurt in the process. This movie is worth watching.

I thought this movie was okay. The acting was not so good, but the story line was okay. I thought the movie was really cute, and I thought the story line was okay. My one problem was that I thought the acting was not so good. But, I gave it an okay rating because I did like the story line. This movie is good for kids and younger people. It's a fun movie, but it could be better.

 This is a great movie. To me, it's not just a film, it's a journey. The actors are phenomenal, and their performances are so amazing that it's almost like watching a play. Not sure what else to say, except that I always love to see movies that make me think, and this one does exactly that.<br /><br />The performances are so great that you really feel like you're getting to know the characters. The way the characters change and then change again is amazing. I never want to forget about these characters, and I also never want to forget the impact that it has on all of the characters involved. This is definitely a movie that will stay with you.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing this movie again and again.

Review of "My Father's Boat"

<br /><br
 I really cannot say that this movie is a masterpiece or a classic. It is a good film though, and it is a very funny and entertaining movie. I also think that this is one of the funniest movies that I have seen. The opening scene of the movie is one of the funniest that I have seen. The movie is about a man who wakes up into a situation that he does not recognize. It seems that he is the only one who is not in the same position of the rest of the people in the whole town. The other people wake up and all look like they are in identical positions. "I am the only one who is not in the same position as everybody else". This is a very funny scene. The movie is about a man who is a very strong and stupid man. He is a very good character. He does not know anything about the town. He does not know anything about the future. The movie is hilarious, and I think that this is one of the funniest movies that I have seen. The movie is about a man who wakes up and he finds himself in a completely different world. He is the only one who is not in the same position of the rest of the people in the whole
 This is an interesting documentary about the beginnings of the modern day extreme sports movement. A lot of the footage is of guys that you have never heard of but I think it is amazing that some of the guys that are interviewed are still active in this new sport. There are some interesting shots of the Olympics of old and I think the story of the early days of the Olympics was well told. I was a little disappointed in the lack of footage of other sports like skateboarding and surfing that were in the Olympics. I can understand why they didn't put in too much footage of the early Olympics because there isn't that much footage of the early events. But I thought that there should have been more footage of other sports. I think they could have put more footage of action sports in the Olympics.

The one thing that I really didn't like about this documentary was the fact that a lot of the footage was of the same guys. Maybe I'm just picky because I like variety but I felt like it was a little boring to watch the same footage over and over again. I think that the guys are just talking about things that most people who have worked in the entertainment industry or sports have experienced or heard about. I mean there aren't
 This is the first movie I ever saw that was shot in the Philippines. It showed the poverty and beauty of the country. The people were so happy and lively. The children played and laughed, the street vendors sold their goods and the women and children worked. The movie was very well made. The director made sure that the story was told the way it was. The actors seemed to be chosen for their talent and not their looks. I thought the film was very thrilling and well done. The movie had many good scenes with a lot of action. I think it was a very good film.

<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/adventure and good music. I would also recommend it to anyone who has never been to the Philippines.

<br /><br />The movie is set in the Philippines in the 16th century. It is about a Spanish priest who is captured by the Chinese and forced to build a bridge across the river.

<br /><br />I rate this movie 8 out of 10. I would give it a 10/10 if I wasn't a little disappointed that it wasn't filmed in the Philippines.

<br /><br
 A very well done, very mature, very disturbing, very good movie. It's a warning to all of us to not give up on those who seem to need more time and attention than we can give them and what we may be asking is too much. I think we all can relate to the main character and are somehow connected to her.<br /><br />The movie is about a young girl in college named Emily who is about to graduate from college. Her father has died and her mother is about to retire from teaching at the college she has taught at for over 30 years. Emily feels that she has lived her life as her mother's daughter, doing all the things her mother wanted her to do, not really being her own person. She's tired of living in her mother's shadow, tired of living in her mother's shadow, tired of living in her mother's shadow.<br /><br />Emily is in a relationship with a young man named Tim and she is about to graduate. Tim wants to get married and start a family. Emily is too young to be married and she feels that. She's not ready for that. She's not ready for that.<br /><br />At this point in the movie,
 This is a great movie. I always knew it was good, but in the last few years I have watched it a few times and it still amazes me. The acting is excellent, but I don't think I have ever seen better acting than the way the boys play the piano. The piano is a very difficult instrument to play, yet they do it so well. What a great part for the actors. The piano is also understated and is not allowed to take over the movie. I love the ending, it is so sad, but it is so well done. Like I said, I love this movie.

 Not a great film, but a good, solid, dumb comedy. The plot is thin and, at times, so is the acting. The characters are obvious stereotypes, but they are played to the hilt. I can't think of 'high brow' films that are as far from 'high brow' as this one. A lot of the humor is based on the fact that it is a remake of an old `B' movie. That's what it is, a remake. But it doesn't suck. The ending is a bit too predictable, but it's still entertaining. There are, however, several scenes that are a bit too over the top, but not offensive. It's not Shakespeare, but it's fun.

The movie is a riff on the `Abbott and Costello' films, with the `B' movie 'The Longest Yard' as the base for the new film. The `longest yard' part is played for laughs, but it's treated seriously enough to be worth the joke. The movie is pretty decent, but it does draw on what worked in the `B' movie. The original `B' movie, `The Longest Yard', had the same `B' movie
 I just finished watching this film for the first time and I was amazed! I'd seen this film before and had it in my video library, but I'd never watched it all the way through. I had heard so much about it, but it always seemed to be a little bit of a snooze. I'm really glad I finally sat down to watch it. This is a beautiful film that has a lot of depth and insight. It portrays the amazing journey of a small child to adulthood in a very small town in Alaska. The amazing thing is that it is set in the 70's and 80's; it really shows how much things have changed since then. The film is a little bit slow, but the emotion and depth just make up for it. The acting is wonderful and the script is wonderful. I highly recommend this film and I hope you watch it soon.

 A great movie that holds up really well today. Great cast, great story and great direction. A great cast includes some very recognizable names including Donald Sutherland, Denholm Elliott, Victor French, and of course, the great Peter O'Toole. The story is about a London banker (O'Toole) who is a very successful and proven business man. He has money, a beautiful wife (O'Toole), a home, and a lot of friends. But he is bored and unhappy. He wants to break out of the mold and be something different. He becomes involved with a group of people that have just come from a mental institution and has a lot in common with them. He begins to hear voices and see things that are not there. He falls in love with one of them (French) and he begins to lose control of his mind. The film is very well done and a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.

4 out of 5 (Very Good)

 This is a great movie. I was entranced by it when I first saw it, and every time i see it I still am. The acting is terrific, and the writing is great.

 This is a powerful film about the fact that when it comes to people's lives, we are powerless. In this case, the life of a quiet, fussy, 'old fashioned' man is taken away. This is a powerful film and it is important that we pay attention to what is happening because we all have to deal with death in some way.

I was impressed with the acting of the main character. The film was unpretentious and real. It didn't try to sensationalize death and it didn't try to be clever by using all the usual tricks of film making, it just told the story and was an honest portrayal of 'death'. The story was believable and the characters were real. It was sad and it made me think.

I can't believe that I haven't seen this film before. It is a great film and I will always remember it. I think that everyone should see this film.

 This is an amazing movie, if you haven't seen it, you should. It's got great acting, great script, great story and great everything. I don't have any idea why this movie isn't better known. The main thing is that it's good, it's just not out there, it's possible you haven't heard of it.<br /><br />The story is about a man who is the father of a boy, and is a drug addict. They are to meet at a train station, but the boy has been abducted by some drug dealers. The man takes his son to the train station, trying to find him. This is a good movie, with a good story and good acting. The acting is great and the story is great. It's just a shame it isn't out there. I haven't seen it in the UK, I've seen it in the US, but I'm sure it's been released in the UK.<br /><br />It's just a shame, it's got a great story and great acting, so it deserves to be better known.<br /><br />10/10

He does this by killing the man who murdered his father.<br /><br />Some of the best acting and cinematography of this type of movie I have ever seen, and the story is quite interesting. <br /><br />I really really enjoyed this movie.

A fine example of a film director at the top of his game.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This film, in my humble opinion, is one of the best examples of film making that I have ever seen. The cinematography and acting are just perfect. I would even dare to say that the cinematography is better than that of some films that I have seen. The acting is just flawless, and the feel of the film is just right. The acting is so believable that I actually forgot that I was watching a film. The story is so well done, and so interesting, that I found
 The movie is very good. The story is well developed and the cast is excellent. The main character is pretty straight forward and it is easy to relate to him. The film is also full of "real" moments, not just Hollywood fast-paced action. The music is also very good. The only thing I regret is that the director did not use the music more effectively. The story could have been developed more and the movie would have been even more engaging. I think the director was aware of this and he was trying to make a movie for home viewing. He did a good job. The movie is worth watching.

A very good movie!

This movie is a very good movie. The story is very good and the cast is excellent. The director did a very good job making this movie. The actors are so natural and they look like they are actually talking to the audience and not just playing a role. I can't believe I am saying this but this is a very entertaining movie. I had to watch the movie twice because I was so engrossed. The story is very believable and
 This is a Gifford's film, one of the best of them. I have seen most of them and this one is worth watching. I really enjoyed the story. A young girl is forced to marry a black man in the South. She is a devout Catholic and she does not want to do it. The film is about the struggle for the soul of the black man and his desire to save the soul of the young girl in the most difficult situation. The acting is excellent and the message is powerful. I think it is important for every person to see this film and to understand the situation of the black man in the South. The story is true but it is difficult to comprehend. I don't know how the film was made. I don't know if the young girl was real or not. But the story is real and it is a must to see it.

 I really did enjoy this movie. It is not a movie that I have seen before. I saw a few of the previews for it and I thought it might be a good movie to watch. I am happy that it was. I really enjoyed the plot, the suspense, and the plot twists. I really didn't expect the ending. The ending really surprised me and I was a little sad at the end.<br /><br />I would give this movie a 10/10

 I just have to say that this movie is the best Action movie I have seen in a long time. The best Action is when you watch it and you can't tell that it is a movie. If you have read the book or seen the movie with Mel Gibson, the book is better. I think that most people would agree that the movie with Mel Gibson is a good movie but the book is better. This is a very well done movie. I think that the people who made it did a very good job with it. I think that it is very close to the book and that is why I like it so much. I think that it is a very good movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Action movies. I think that there is no one I would not recommend it to. I think that it is very good.

I just saw this movie the other night and I thought it was okay. I didn't like the ending of the movie though. I think that it was a good movie, but it wasn't as good as the book. I think that the main problem that the movie had was that they didn't do the part where they climb out of the cave
 This is a remarkable film. It is not just a documentary, it is a movie. It has all the qualities of a great movie. It is a story about a person who creates a cult and is responsible for the death of some people. It shows the events that led up to the death of the people, but it tells about the people, who were not involved in the death.<br /><br />I think this movie is a great example of how you should tell a story. It is realistic, but it isn't a documentary. It is a story about real people that was made into a movie.<br /><br />The scene when the dead bodies are being carried out by the firefighters is the climax of the movie, but it is not the only interesting part of the movie. There are many scenes in the movie that are very interesting.

I'd give it 9 if I could. The movie is entertaining, but I think it was over-hyped by the media. For one thing, it shows how the media can sell a story that doesn't really exist. If a story is not true, you should not report it.

I especially
 A very solid action/adventure flick with a somewhat predictable but nonetheless enjoyable script and a few genuinely memorable scenes. A great cast of characters, each with his/her own set of strengths, weaknesses, and personalities. A surprisingly good soundtrack. A good balance between action and drama. A good cast of supporting actors, including the always reliable and charismatic Fred Ward, the always solid and dependable Dirk Bogarde, the always dependable Peter Boyle, the always dependable John Rhys-Davies, the always dependable and talented David Warner, the always dependable and talented Telly Savalas, the always dependable and talented Curd Jürgens, and the always dependable and talented John Saxon. A solid script, although with a few predictable plot developments. In short, a fun action/adventure flick with a few genuinely memorable moments.

The Spy Who Loved Me is a great movie. It was the last Bond movie that was directed by the great Lewis Gilbert. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being disappointed that the gadgets were not as cool as in the previous movie. But I'm
 This movie is a must for all horror fans because it has every gene of a horror movie. It has great special effects, a good plot, suspense, characters and it's a lot of fun to watch. The only bad thing is that the movie is almost 2 hours long. If you don't have time to watch it all in one sitting, watch it the night before and the next morning. The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it is in English and it is not subtitled. This movie is a horror classic and it is not to be missed. I hope it comes out on DVD soon.

Grimmjow's Fangirl (2003) Grimmjow's Fangirl is a great movie. I think you should all watch it and explore the world of Grimmjow. 2 July 2003 - 2 out of 5 users found this review helpful. First of all, Grimmjow is a great bad-ass character. He is a vampire and he always has something to do. He is very violent, he is very strong and he is very hot.

 **spoilers**<br /><br />This movie was great, the most enjoyable of the series so far. I had a gut feeling that this movie would be really good and I was right. The whole time I was watching this movie I was just thinking how good it was. The humor was great and there was a real feeling of suspense throughout the whole movie. I could relate to the characters, as I am almost exactly how they were portrayed. It was just so funny and so touching, that it was even better than the previous movies.<br /><br />The whole movie was very realistic and most of the problems that the main characters were facing were very believable. I liked how the main characters were all so different, but how they all had so much in common. It makes the movie more interesting and it makes the characters seem more real.<br /><br />I loved the way the movie ended and I was so glad that it didn't end in a cliffhanger. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who like the previous movies, as it was just as good. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us in the next movie.

<br /><br />Grade
 This is the second time I've seen this movie, the first viewing being when I was only fourteen years old. I was reminded of the movie when I saw the extraordinary performance by Penelope Cruz as the young woman who falls in love with a man who is not human. I had forgotten how good the actors were in this movie, both the main actors and the smaller supporting characters. It was a nice change to see a movie that was not just about vampires, or werewolves, or any of the other creatures that Hollywood seems so eager to feed us. The movie is not perfect. It does not have the depth of other movies from the same director - but it is a great start to a new direction that seems to be what's next for Mr. Guarnier. The movie is full of romance, but it is not just a love story. It is a story of what love can do and what love can do to you; and it is a story about running away from the ones you love. It is a movie about being different. And it is a story about the people who are different and how they are treated.

There is one sequence in the movie that is over-the-top and laughable, but somehow it
 This is a great movie - very entertaining and entertainingly funny. I like the way it's told and the way the actors are chosen. It's the kind of movie that has so many aspects to it that it keeps you interested. I like the way the movie is told. The comedy is very, very good, and the drama is also very good and even touching. I like the way the movie is told. A great movie to watch with friends or family.

 I watched the film twice, and both times I found myself laughing uncontrollably. This is a great piece of humour, especially if you're into Animal House. One of the best comedies I've ever seen.

I saw the original film in a theatre on my eighteenth birthday, and I have to say that even though I considered it a good film, this one is far better. The cast have been changed around, but I didn't think it was too bad. I actually found myself liking the new team, which I was surprised by. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much at a film. I'm not going to say anything too much about the plot, because the trailer is painfully obvious, but I will say that the film is pretty impressive. It's very funny and I thought it was executed brilliantly.

The trailer is misleading and does not give the film justice. I didn't think the film was too long at all, and I had a good time watching it. The only thing I can say that I didn't like was the film's ending. I thought it was a bit rushed, but that's just me being picky.

Well done to the cast and crew of this film
 Loved this movie. I thought it was worth seeing. It was creepy and funny, and the plot was different in a good way. I was hooked from the beginning and didn't want to leave. I hope to see more from this director in the future. Also, I would recommend this for someone who enjoys a good horror movie with a good story to go along with it. I would also recommend this movie to someone who is looking for a different type of horror movie. I would also recommend this movie to someone who loves a good comedy.

 Unfortunately, I can't find a single review of this movie, so I'll add my own. I was hoping it would be something along the lines of "Fahrenheit 9/11" but I was disappointed. I'm not a fan of the "reality" thing. I've seen too much of it lately. I just want to be entertained by a good story. This one was OK but not great. I would have liked to have seen more of the characters and their backgrounds. I'm not one for the reality-style documentaries (i.e. "Inside Job") but I do appreciate the insight. This movie did not do that. I just felt like I was sitting through a 20 minute infomercial for some product that I did not want. I'd rather watch a good movie and forget the rest of the day than sit through a "reality" documentary.

What I most enjoyed was the music. I've been a fan of Michael Jackson since the "Thriller" video came out. He was a great performer and one of the few musical geniuses I've seen in my lifetime. I love his music and this movie did not disappoint.

I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
 In this film, the absurd is forever a-la-mode, and it's pretty entertaining. This is one of those films that I've seen so many times that it's hard to go see it again, but I just can't get enough of it. Troma films are always funny, but this one is a masterpiece. It makes fun of everything, and it's all so funny. As a reviewer, I can't believe that I've never seen it before. I had to rethink the whole film, which is pretty cool. It's just a terrific film to watch. I love it.

There's a lot of great stuff in this film. They really get some nice characters, and you can see that the characters in the films aren't acting, they're really like that. They have a lot of nice characters, and you can see that they're all having a great time. The whole film is just a lot of fun, and I love it.

 Well made documentary about the battle of the sexes. We all know the story. A man's best friend is a dog. A woman's best friend is her husband. The main point, though, is the juxtaposition of the two. This is a film about a woman and a dog. The woman is played by Helen Hunt. The dog is played by her husband and love of her life, Albert Hall. The film follows the two on a journey after the death of Helen's husband. What I liked most about the film was the juxtaposition of the two leading characters. It creates a nice contrast between the two people. Albert is a very funny guy. He's a little bit on the quirky side. He can be a little bit of a bad boy. Helen is much more straight laced and a little bit of a prude. She's a little bit of a mom. The film also shows a man, Albert's best friend, who sets a very good example for all of us. The film is filled with great stories by Albert and great stories by Helen. You can tell that they love each other. The film also shows Albert and Helen's relationship with their children. It's a lot of fun to see these two people find
 The character and the plot are both very interesting, but the cast and the sets are realy memorable. This film is one of those great American films that is sometimes forgotten. Maybe it's the lack of special effects, which is not a problem, but the sound and the video quality is not great. That's the main problem of the film, and it's disturbing. The only good solution is to see it in a good theatre.

(The original title is The Last Picture Show. I prefer to keep the original title, because the last picture show is a very good phrase to describe it.)

 Key & Peele are back and this time the duo are in a movie about the iconic duo of Rodney Dangerfield and Joan Rivers. They used to make jokes about Jewish people, black people and etc, but now they are playing themselves, but this movie is different from the TV show. It's not a cartoon but a serious movie. It's not a comedy, but the typical romantic comedy. It's not a movie about two enemies, but two best friends. The leads are so great and they are just perfect. It's funny, cute and romantic. It's not a big deal to me, but I've seen a lot of people watching it and enjoying it. It's also a good movie to watch with your family, or a date. I don't know what else to tell. It's great, nice, funny and it has a good message.

 This is the best movie I have ever seen. It is so powerful that you get sucked in instantly. I couldn't stop watching it. The acting, directing, acting, acting, acting, acting, acting. It is truly a masterpiece. I can't count how many times I've seen this movie. I've seen it at least a hundred times. I know it well. I think I could quote most of the movie's dialogue. I love the movie so much that I'm actually thinking of making it a project. I'm going to read every article I can find on this movie and make a paper on it. It's a movie that I will never forget. It's a movie about identity, about self-discovery, about love, about life. It's the best movie EVER!!!!!!

 The Last American Virgin is a brilliant, sometimes hilarious, look at the world of high school sex and its effects on the main character. This is one of those films where the performances are so good (especially by the young cast) that some of the material seems contrived. The film is a bit dated in terms of its treatment of the issue, but the message is still relevant to today's teenagers. The film is not without its flaws. It is awfully long, and the final few scenes are a bit too hokey. The film is also very explicit, with many scenes of fairly graphic sex.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully acted film and the performances are really what make it for me. The cast is extremely good, and the chemistry between the leads is amazing. "Virgin" is played by Allison Moorer, who is absolutely incredible. The rest of the cast is equally good. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who was the original choice for the role, was too old. She would have been able to play the character much better. I can't say enough good things about the performances in this film. The story is also quite compelling. The final scene of the film is quite a shocker.<br /><br
 I wasn't sure going into this film that I cared for it at all. The story felt like a wasted opportunity. The film was written by the author of KID & the best selling book by the same name. The book was supposed to be a sequel to the film, but wasn't. At the time the film was made, I didn't think that the book was very good, but since the film was made, I've found it to be very entertaining. So even though the film didn't quite live up to its potential, I still enjoyed it. I wouldn't say that this was a great film, but it was good enough to keep me entertained. I think the film would've been better with a better story, and one that flowed better. I don't know if a sequel is in the works, but I'd like to know if it is. I know a sequel might not be in the works, but it doesn't hurt to ask. This film has some great moments and is worth watching. The film is done so well, that you can watch it over and over again, and not get tired of it. This is the kind of film that you can watch with your friends, or take the kids to see
 I rented this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it. It was very different from the other movies I've seen of the same genre. It was cute and made me smile. The characters were interesting and the story was interesting. I like that it was different from the others. I would highly recommend this movie. I have seen movies that have been taken from this movie and done poorly, but this is a good movie. It was not perfect, but is a good movie. I give it 8 out of 10.

I hope you enjoy the movie!

4 out of 5 for me.

I'm not a reviewer. I just like watching movies.

I'm not big into movie reviews, but I do like to watch movies.

 I just finished watching the movie "The Ghost and the Darkness" and I must say that I was impressed by it. I had seen some of the most recent Hollywood movies, but this one is a movie that you can watch over and over again.<br /><br />I had seen some of the most recent movies such as "The Kingdom" and "The Sum of All Fears", but I must say that I was more impressed by "The Ghost and the Darkness".<br /><br />The movie is about a British soldier and his American counterpart with a past that they have to work out. The movie has many twists and turns, and I think that everyone will be surprised by the ending. I think the movie is the best out of all of the recent action-adventure movies.

10/10

4.0 out of 5 stars The Ghost and the Darkness: Great movie! Just not for everybody. Format: DVD This movie is great. The acting is excellent. The story is original and well written. I felt compelled to watch the movie when I first saw it, I just could not stop. Even though this movie is not for everybody, it still is a great movie to watch. The story
 In this episode, we find the Doctor and Rose where we last left them, in the TARDIS. The Doctor is obviously in a state of shock over Jack's death, as it was in front of him, and Rose is trying to comfort him. The Doctor begins to tell her that he's going to go in search of his other selves, but Rose badgers him into remembering what he said to Jack just before he blew himself up.<br /><br />It's a very different episode to what we're used to seeing. Like "Voyage of the Damned," it's all about the Doctor, his emotions and his relationship with Rose. The Doctor is clearly very upset and is blaming himself for Jack's death. He tells Rose that it was his fault and that he should have saved him. He breaks down and cries and Rose holds him, but you can tell she's angry. She's angry because she thinks he's blaming himself for Jack's death, when he's actually saying that he should have saved him. The Doctor says that if he'd saved Jack, it would have been the biggest mistake of his life. This is clearly another loss for the Doctor, and it's very touching and emotional to see him breaking
 Everyone knows that The Little Rascals is a classic. But how many people actually know that the movie is based on a true story? The film is about a group of orphan children who form a gang of juvenile delinquents and form a gang of juvenile delinquents. They are constantly getting in trouble at school, at home, and on the streets. The leader of the gang is Alfalfa (Buster Keaton), a kid who is the king of all he surveys. He is the bravest, toughest, and most intelligent kid. He is the one who handles all the things that the gang of kids do. He is the one who gets them out of trouble, and does all the things that the gang does. The kids that make up the gang are: Milo (Gabby Glass), a moronic kid who constantly falls asleep in class and avoids doing his homework; Darla (Virginia Davis), a tough girl who is the ringleader of the gang; Buckwheat (Charley Chase), a kid with a big mouth and bad manners, who is always getting into trouble; Slats (Gene Wilder), a kid that has a stutter; Alfalfa's sister (Marilyn Miller), who is a
 The film was amazing and worked wonders in showing a side of the depression that one never sees in a film, and at the same time it created an atmosphere that was as if we were in the depression. It also showed the problems that people had in that time, and how they tried to deal with them. I loved it, and I recommend it to anyone.

 I saw this movie back in the late 90s and it is still one of my favorites. It's not a comedy, but it's a serious movie. The film is based on a true story, but the movie adds a lot of humor. It's very touching and it shows how people treat each other in different cultures. It's a very good movie. I recommend it for everyone.

4.0 out of 5 stars A classic! Format: DVD One of the best movies ever made about the plight of immigrant workers in the early 1900's. This is a true story, and it shows the hardships their lives were like. It's not funny or lighthearted, but a real look at the lives of these people. It's very touching and is worth a watch.

4.0 out of 5 stars Love It! Format: DVD I saw this movie at a young age and I am 35 years old and I still love it. I had to read the book first and it was a great story that came to life on screen. I did not find it funny at all but I found it sad. I now tell everyone to see the movie on DVD because it deserves more exposure. I am glad I saw it when
 I was very impressed by this movie. The way it was filmed and the story line just makes this movie a great one. I actually thought it was going to be a bad one but let me tell you it was a great one. There is def. a lot of nudity in the movie and a lot of strong language but that doesn't bother me at all. I was very pleased with the way the characters were developed and how the story line unfolded. I have to admit the beginning was kind of slow and I wasn't sure about the characters at first but it all worked out for the best. The ending I thought was good and I actually loved the way it ended. I think this movie is a good one to watch especially if you are a fan of the horror/thriller genre.

****SPOILERS!****

The first person that is killed is killed by a person who is supposed to be dead. I never liked that one little thing about the movie. I think the movie would have been better if that had been left in there. That was a bit of a let down I thought. The part where the woman goes to her husband
 "The Day of the Jackal" sets the standard for film-making on the small screen. Unlike many of the -thriller" films that run around at the moment (which often seem to be a sort of "Scarlett O'Hara" meets "And God Created Woman" making-of-a-thriller lite) this one is actually a good thriller. The fact that it is based on a real life case makes this even more impressive. <br /><br />There are no real stars in this film, but it has a good supporting cast, especially the great David Warner, and the confident direction of Fred Zinnemann, who has made many great films, including "The Day of the Jackal". <br /><br />"The Day of the Jackal" is one of the best films made for TV. It is not a "television movie", it is a feature film. It has the kind of pace and tension that movie viewers will appreciate. <br /><br />It is interesting that the "day of the Jackal" killer, and the real life killer, were both British.

 I am a fan of The Addams Family and was very excited when I heard about the movie being made. The cast was great. I can't say enough about this movie. It was so good. I think that the cast did an excellent job with the characters. I will see the film again when it comes on T.V.

My family did not like the movie at first but by the end of the movie they were cheering for the characters with me. They all agreed that this movie was better than the original. I think that the story was a little bit longer and the characters a little more developed. I think that this is a great movie.

Geraldine McNeil as Wednesday Addams was excellent as always. Her character was very interesting and well thought out.

Malcolm McDowell as Gomez Addams was great. I think that he did a wonderful job with the character.

Michael Gough as Uncle Fester is the best. He is the best in the business. His character was very interesting and very funny.

I think that a lot of other people would agree with me. I thought that this movie was great. It was a lot better than the original. I think that
 I went in to this movie with very low expectations. I hate horror movies and they usually come off as being silly and pointless. In my opinion, the only horror movie I've seen that was worth watching was "The Shining." Other than that, I've never seen a horror movie that I could recommend to anybody. However, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is a very different story. It gives the viewer a behind the scenes look at the whole thing. It's very hard for me to say what I liked about this movie, because it was really hard for me to watch it. I mean, it is pretty gruesome at some parts. But overall, it was a very good movie. <br /><br />I really didn't want to see this movie, but I couldn't turn it off. It was really disturbing to watch, but I think the acting was actually very good. I mean, if I were the one in that situation, I would probably act the way she did. I felt bad for her, but I also felt like I had to watch everything to see how it all played out. I was continually amazed at the things that were done to her body. I also felt like I was watching a
 This is a remake of the French classic La Ronde (1966) and does not do nearly as well as the original. The story is told as a series of vignettes featuring individuals in a small town and the various ways they deal with the death of their best friend and the subsequent revelation of being a serial killer. The cast is a who's who of Europe's glamourous young actors of the day. Ricci, Cruise, De Sica, White and others appear in roles that are well written and depicted, yet they don't stand out quite as much as their French counterparts did in the original version.<br /><br />The film is not without its moments of humor, but it is often too slow and the musical score is forgettable.<br /><br />Good cast, good story, good acting, but not a masterpiece.

Rating of

3/4 stars

The first reviews of this movie were quite negative, but I thought it was a great movie, great cast, a little slow, but that's all.

One of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time. It is all about the people and there is a lot of romance and mystery in it.
 This film is a very interesting glimpse into a small part of the way life used to be in pre-civil war America.<br /><br />The plot follows a group of young men who leave their farm to go to the city in search of work. They are about six weeks into their trip when a young man named Hobson unexpectedly shows up at their camp. He has been sent by his father, the owner of a large farm, to find out if the farm has been sold and who bought it. Hobson can't avoid telling them the bad news, but he won't tell them why.<br /><br />The next day they take a wagon load of supplies they have saved to the town and sell them to buy more food. They have been going on foot because they are afraid to go into town because they are afraid of being robbed. They have been walking for days and have no idea how much farther they have to go. When they figure out how much farther they have to go they decide to ride the horses to town. Hobson falls and breaks his leg. The rest of the boys try to carry him but can't. Hobson's friend, Clyde, rides his horse into town to get help. A doctor
 This is a classic. The best of the lot. The originality and depth of the characters is apparent from the first scene to the last. The actors are brilliant and realistic. The script is very clever and the direction is excellent. It's hard to believe that this is over 35 years old. It is one of the best films ever made.

If you have not seen it, you haven't really lived. It's a treasure.

All the President's Men (1976) A splendid
 I had a chance to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival at the beginning of October, and I must tell you that it is an excellent piece of work. I really enjoyed it - a quiet, thoughtful examination of the Canadian experience during the First World War with a subtle and detailed look at the war itself and its effects on the people involved. The film was based on a book by the same name by Stephen Leacock, and it was originally made in 1939. It's a great example of the way that silent films could be used to tell a story - the film is remarkably silent, with very few sound effects and very little in the way of music. The film is desaturated in colour, as if it is based on black and white photographs, and it is shot in a very simple, documentary-style way. The story is told predominantly through a series of interviews with the people involved in the war - the men and women who were there, the nurses, the soldiers - and the movie is based on the book in which these people discuss the war and their experiences in it. The result is a very interesting look at what life was like for them during the war, and how that affected them afterwards. It's an excellent piece
 Someone posted a rather harsh review of this film on the IMDb site. I felt compelled to post a more positive review. After all, I watched the entire movie over the course of the last week, and to me, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's not an easy film to watch, and it's not a movie for everyone. But it IS a great film. The film is about the impact that one person can have on the world, and the fact that there is a huge and very unfair injustice in the world. The story is tragic, and I was so moved by it that I was in tears many times. I love this film, and I urge you to rent or buy it. I'm going to include the IMDb link here in case anyone else wants to read a more positive review.

7/10.

 I don't see how anybody could see this film and not like it. It's an incredibly funny movie. The acting is all right, except for the very end where it gets a bit over-the-top. The plot is simple and well done, the writing is funny and the acting pretty good. I especially liked how the characters all acted. They were all very believable in their roles. The plot was a little predictable, but I can't say I was too surprised. If you want to see a funny movie, this is the one to see.

I give it a 9 out of 10.

 I don't think many people have seen this film, but if you have, you know what I'm talking about. It's not just the story that is great, but the cast is amazing. I like the fact that this is a very different kind of 'romance'. It's not just another movie about a guy and a girl. It's a story about two different people, and watching them grow and change each other is what makes it so engaging. I love watching it again and again, and I'm sure other people do too. It's a great movie for the whole family.

3.0 out of 5 stars I loved it but it's not the same as 'The Fugitive' Format: DVD I've seen this movie a few times and I really love it. The first time I saw it I thought it was great, but last night I thought it was just another romantic movie. I think that's probably why I loved it the first time (I'm a romantic). Maybe if you didn't like the first one, it won't change your opinion of this one.

 I saw this film in the theaters when it first came out. I wasn't a fan of Sandy Dennis but the movie is so funny, so clever and so inventive that it makes you laugh in spite of yourself. I saw it again a few years ago and it was even better. The most brilliant thing about this movie is that there is no real plot. It's a series of short vignettes that are linked together by the title. The characters are so quirky and the situations so funny that you just sit back and laugh. Dennis is brilliant in this film. She is so funny and so sure of herself that you can't help but enjoy her. I love this movie and look forward to seeing it again.

 I feel like I've been waiting for this movie for my whole life. I loved The Room and am a huge Tommy Wiseau fan. As a result, I was very excited to see this film. I found it to be very entertaining and hilarious. Watching the lead actress and her "friends" get completely wasted and completely fall apart is priceless. I'm still laughing about these scenes months later! I also enjoyed the scenes with the two main character's parents, who were amazing and hilarious. The movie is quite silly, but I found it to be an entertaining watch. I thought it was great that they included all the ridiculous and excessive things that happened in the original film. I have to say, though, that the ending was a disappointment to me. I had such high hopes and was hoping for something very different, but it turned out to be the same old Tommy Wiseau. I think this movie is great, but I wish it had been more diverse and original. I still recommend it to anyone who is a fan of The Room or Tommy Wiseau.

 "The Caine Mutiny" is one of the best courtroom dramas ever made. It's a story about loyalty, integrity and the consequences of a crew's actions. There is no doubt that this is one of the best courtroom dramas ever made. It is based on the true story of the court-martial of Lieutenant Fred C. Smith and the events that followed. It is a story of a battle between the officers and the crew of the USS Caine, a World War II Navy destroyer. The crew of the Caine mutinied with the intent to take over the ship. The officers on the ship, who did not want to go to the Pacific, but had no choice, were trapped and found themselves in a court-martial. They had to prove that they did not want to go to the Pacific. The court-martial was watched by the entire Navy, and it is a story of loyalty and integrity. It is a great story. This movie was released in 1954, and it holds up very well. The acting is excellent, and the cast is top-notch. Humphrey Bogart, as Lt. Cmdr. John Aubrey, is very convincing as a Navy officer. He is one
 This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The plot is well developed and the actors are excellent. The movie is a little slow, but it is well worth the wait. The only downside is that it is not exactly what it seems. It keeps you guessing until the end. This is the kind of movie that you want to be able to discuss over a drink or a meal. I highly recommend it. It is a must see!

I must say that I was skeptical about this movie, but I loved it. It was a very good movie, not too explicit and not too slow. The story kept you guessing, but I found it interesting. I think that the actors in this movie were great. The only thing is that I did not like the ending, I think it was a little too obvious and the way the movie ended was a little unexpected. All in all it was a great movie though and I would love to see a sequel.<br /><br />

 I've been a fan of the original "Battlestar Galactica" since the day it aired. My brother and I watched it every night when we were kids. I thought that the mini series was a travesty and a disgrace to the original. I even wrote a letter to the producers asking them to remake the original series. <br /><br />This new series is just as good as the original. I loved the way that it went back to the roots of the original. And the fact that it does not have the political correctness that is found in the original. <br /><br />The fact that it is on Sci Fi channel is just a bonus. Watch it. You will love it. <br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br />

One of the best shows on TV.

Kinda like the original show, but more modern.

All the original actors return and it is all that it was before.

It could have been better, but it was still great.

 I was a bit reluctant to watch this movie, but it's worth the time. This movie looks like a typical Japanese movie, but in the end it was a great movie with a great storyline. The characters are typical, but the movie has the same style I enjoy. It's not a masterpiece, but you don't really have to be a critic to enjoy it. I really liked it and can recommend it to anyone.

A family of four loses their jobs and has to move out of their house. They are supposed to move to a small farm, but the house is haunted by a ghost. The ghost kills them, so they have to find a way to get rid of him. I watched this movie to relax, but it's not a bad movie. It's a bit creepy, but I like it. I would recommend this movie, but the storyline is a bit simplistic. I enjoyed it and can recommend it to anyone.

 This is an interesting documentary about the history of the rise of fascism, and the attempts to bring fascism back to power. The rise of fascism was a response to the failure of the liberal democratic society to manage the economies of Europe in the late 19th century, and the failure of the liberal democratic societies to manage the wars that were being fought. Fascism tried to be the way forward, but it proved to be too much for social democracy to handle. The result was the rise of the anti-fascist movement, and the attempt by the communists to fight the fascists in a way that was not only more effective than the liberal democracies, but more successful in bringing the fascists to heel. The result was the defeat of fascism in Europe and the defeat of the fascists in the world. The rise of the anti-fascist movement was a major reason why the Nazis were never able to take over the leadership of the Third Reich. The result of the defeat of the Third Reich was the defeat of fascism in the world.

The documentary is well produced, and the story it tells is interesting. It is well worth a view if you are interested in the history of the rise of fascism.

 This is one of my favorite movies. It is simple and funny, but also very deep and intelligent. I also like the fact that it is not "preachy" but self-consciously moralistic. I think it is the best movie I have ever seen about the subject of rape. I like that it does not use the "R" word, but it does not shy away from the fact that the main character is a rapist. I have seen this movie four times and I have never been less than moved by it. I think it is a rare movie that can be both funny and dramatic, with some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies.

*****

I've never been so moved by a movie. I've been told that this is a very important fim about rape, but I didn't realise just how much I would take from this movie until I had seen it. I think it is a very intelligent movie, even though it was totally new to me. I think it is important to remember that every person has their own unique life, and that not all people suffer the same things.
 You can tell that this was the first feature film that Francis Coppola had directed. I love the way he seems to have a real eye for poetic imagery, with these very long, flowing scenes that start off seeming to be a little boring but lead to a great payoff. The dialogue is also excellent and my favorite is the conversation that takes place between the two main characters, in which they have a lot of real, heartfelt things to say to each other.<br /><br />The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography and was nominated for Best Original Score, but it lost to "The Godfather, Part II." It's also interesting to note that the film had a lot of trouble getting through the MPAA, as it was given an X rating, which was later changed to an R rating.

 Whether you take the movie on its own merits or with the knowledge of the source material it's only a slight difference. The movie is fast paced, funny, and full of good looking women. The main character is a decent guy and his friends are assholes who he's willing to do anything for. All the ladies in the movie are beautiful, and most of them are in a scene or two. I was surprised that all of the sex scenes weren't longer, but I guess if you're just looking for a quick flick you can try this one out. The movie also has a fairly good plot, but it isn't very deep. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's not a great movie either. I think all of the people who would like to see this movie are fans of the TV show, and if you're not, you might be left a bit confused and unsatisfied.

 I love the movie, it is an ordinary family, who get in a lot of trouble, but then there is a twist, something extraordinary happens and the mom gets involved. It has a great cast, among them, Martin Sheen, and an amazing supporting cast. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I have shared it with many people, and they all enjoy it, it is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again. It is a new movie, it came out in February, and I have seen it twice, and I am now going to see it again, soon. I have also watched the clip, and it is a great clip, I will be buying the DVD soon

 One of the most underrated of the late-night talk shows, the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is, in my opinion, the best of the lot. The show has a quirky sense of humor and is more in-depth than the other competing talk shows. The host is obviously a fan of comedy, and his guests are often absurd, imaginative and very funny, and the show is shot in a vein of surrealism. Ferguson's guests range from Jerry Seinfeld and William Shatner to the cast of Spinal Tap and many other celebrities who are in the news. He is also one of the few late-night talk show hosts that does not seem to be trying too hard. I have only seen about three shows of his. I am a fan of pretty much everything on television so I watch a lot of late night and Craig Ferguson is one of my favorites.

 I saw this movie at the local art house and I liked it very much. The acting is first-rate and the music is excellent. I often find that movies about artists are not accurate, but this is a true story about a very talented man.I highly recommend it.

The movie was very well cast and did a good job of portraying the early days of the "Beat Generation" in San Francisco. The movie shows the difficulties of being a struggling artist in the very early days of the 20th century. The acting is superb, especially by the young star of the movie, Anthony Perkins. He is very believable as a troubled young man from the South who has had a hard life. Plenty of good music, photography, and art. The movie has themes that are relevant today, as well.

I saw this movie in a theater in New York City. The movie was very good. It was not a very elaborate movie, but it was very well done. The scenery was beautiful and it was interesting to see the influence of the San Francisco beatniks on the rest of the country. It is a story about a very talented artist, Jack Kerouac. The movie was very well
 This film is wonderful. It's a musical comedy, and since I'm a musical comedy buff, it was a treat.<br /><br />The story revolves around a village which has a few people who are left with no purpose in life. It's a story about a family with a young son, who has just lost his mother, who is trying to find his own identity.<br /><br />The songs are great, and they are all sung in English, so there's no chance of that terrible Disney-like language.<br /><br />If you love musicals, you'll love this.

 The final moments of the film are the best, but the movie itself is an excellent classic, and has all the elements of a great movie - great acting, great music, good cinematography, some violent scenes, good message, etc.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch as usual. The lead actor is good, and of course the supporting actors, who have not been mentioned before, are also excellent. I especially liked the little kid who played the mule. He was just perfect for the part, and that's quite an achievement in a movie like this, where kids are usually pretty much used as props.<br /><br />The story of the movie is not new, but it is still very good. It's not realistic, but it's also not exaggerated. It's a story of courage and heroism. You get the feeling that the main character is really trying to save his son, and that what he is doing is really worthwhile. The fact that he is killed in the end is tragic, but it's not really unexpected, and the way that it happens is not really a surprise, since the main character always had a pretty dark side.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie
 The first "Star Trek" movie was one of the best films ever made. It was not one of the most popular, but it was one of the best films ever made. Into Darkness is no exception to that rule. It took everything that made the first film great, and improved upon it. It's still a very entertaining film, and I'm happy that I saw it in the theater.<br /><br />I was expecting this film to be filled with action and adventure, but what I got was a film that was more about character development. The film takes place a few years after the events of the first film, and brings back the crew of the Enterprise, but with a few key changes. The crew is older, and more seasoned. They are more focused and more serious about their jobs. This adds a nice level of depth to the film. The script is solid, and the acting is great.<br /><br />The special effects are well done. The space battles are spectacular, and the effects are well done. The visual effects are extremely well done, and the photography is beautiful. The space scenes are well done, and the scenes on Earth are also well done.<br /><br />Overall, I was
 I first saw this movie in a cinema broadcasted in France in 1954. I was at school and I was struck by the images and the music. When I got home I put it on my disc recorder and I put it on every day until I was able to get a copy of it.<br /><br />I saw it again in a cinema in the UK in 1971, I was pleased to see the original version without any edits or cuts, and still I was impressed by the images and the music. When I got home I put it on my disc recorder and I put it on every day until I was able to get a copy of it.<br /><br />I saw it again in 1982 in a cinema in the UK and I was very disappointed to see it cut and edited, I saw the original version but it was not the same. So I have been looking for it for a while and I finally found it in 1992 in a UK supermarket. I was so happy to find it, I put it on my disc recorder and I put it on every day until I was able to get a copy of it.<br /><br />I saw it again in 1999 in a cinema in the UK and I was very pleased
 Spoilers. - if you have not seen the movie, and don't want to know what happens, please stop reading. You have been warned.<br /><br />The movie, in my opinion, was brilliant. Perhaps it was not 100% true to the book, but it was close enough that I wasn't bothered. The movie was very faithful to the book in many ways, even down to the names of the characters and the names of the places and the time period. The actors were very good, and did an excellent job portraying the characters. Some of the actors were better than others, but I thought the whole cast did a great job. The music was also very good. I thought there were really no mistakes with the music, it fit the mood of the movie perfectly. I also thought the director did a great job of directing the whole thing. I had never seen a movie that was so well directed.

<br /><br />It is a very good movie. It is a great movie. If you don't like it, that's your problem, not mine. I am recommending it to everyone. I think it's a great movie for anyone. I think it's a great movie for

I didn't know that this was a movie based on a book. The costumes are great and the story is very exciting. The effects are good and appealing. I really like the opening scene when the king and queen are talking about the play and Robin Hood. I like the scenes when Robin Hood is talking to the king and the queen. They were very interesting and fun to watch. The story is very interesting and very exciting.

The acting is good and the story is very exciting and very interesting. The sets are great and the story is very interesting. I love the part when Robin Hood comes back to the forest, and Renee Zellweger is the one who says who he is. The story is great and very interesting and very exciting. I really like when Robin Hood is explaining who he is and that he is the best archer in the world. I like the part where Robin Hood

The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old and in the mood for a story about a good guy and a bad guy, a good guy and a bad guy, a good guy and a bad guy. The second time I saw it, I was a 19 year old college student who was in the mood for a story about good guys, bad guys, and stupid people. I still like the movie, but it's not what I was expecting, and I think that's OK. I would have been perfectly happy with a good story about good guys doing good things, but I wasn't expecting that, and it was a fun surprise. <br /><br />I like the movie, but I have to say that the first time I saw it, all I could think was "WTF is going on with this movie?" There's no coherent plot, the characters are all completely flat, the world is completely incomprehensible, and the only thing I can really remember is a couple of scenes where I was thinking, "Hey, this is pretty cute," and then subsequently rolling my eyes at the utterly juvenile dialogue. I don't
 I grew up in a very small town where no matter what your occupation was, if you were working class you were always looked down upon by the local wealthy elite. One of the worst things that could happen to you was to be caught in a bad mood, even when you didn't mean to be. This film doesn't tell you this. The film shows you. It shows you the lives of those who are always working but never seem to have time to enjoy life. They work to support their families, their children, their elderly parents, and neighbors. A turning point in their lives occurs when a child of a friend of theirs is caught in a snowstorm and dies. The community is torn between blaming the police officers who they feel should have been able to save the child and the parents who are convinced that they wanted to send their child out into that storm. The truth is that no one knows, and this film shows you the truth. It is not a happy film, but it does show the truth and it does show how we all have the same problems, toil for what we have, and can lose it all in an instant. In the end, the film shows that lost children are forever, and it shows how we should
 I saw this movie in the theatre, and I must say that I truly enjoyed this movie. It is a well put together movie, which is well executed. The cast is great. The cinematography is beautiful. There are some great scenes with the music. The soundtrack is well done, and it adds a great effect to the movie. The movie is very well done. It is a great movie. The acting was great, and the actors made the movie. The movie is great, and it is worth seeing. This movie is a great movie.

 I saw this movie and was so moved by the story and the acting. The story goes on to show the real life of a true hero. The movie is an interesting and well put together story. I have not seen a movie like this one in a long time. I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you have a lot of time to kill, this movie will help you pass the time and keep your attention. I will be watching it again. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

*Spoiler* I think the only thing it lacked was the ending. I hope they don't ruin the ending. I want to see the real life story. I want to know what really happened. I want to see the truth.

 Some people may be put off by the fact that this film is in black and white, but I was not. The film was shot in black and white because it was made in 1935, when colour film was still extremely expensive. The film takes place in the 1920's and the clothes are also black and white, and this also helps to set the mood.<br /><br />The film is set in the West, and it's the story of a town called "Beaver Dam" in the state of Wyoming, where a group of young men are preparing to ride through the area. The film opens with one of the young men getting his horse ready for the ride. He is seen brushing down his horse, checking the girth and saddle, and putting on his riding equipment. He then replaces the saddle on the horse, and checks that it is secure. He then rides away, leading his horse.<br /><br />The second shot is of one of the young men from the movie. He is seen in his room, and he is looking out of the window at the view. He is then seen adjusting the blind, and then walks to the window again, still looking out at the view. He then goes to the small
 The buzz word is "auteur". In other words, the director is the driving force behind the film. In the case of "The Tall Target", the director is the writer/producer/director/editor/star, John Woo.<br /><br />Woo is perhaps the most beguiling and versatile director in Hong Kong cinema. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of martial arts (and maybe every other form of combat), and an instinctive sense of how a fight should be staged. He can make a relatively cheap action film look and feel like an epic. He can use a single shot to make the audience feel like they're watching a movie.<br /><br />In "The Tall Target", he takes a big risk. He's not only directing himself, he's also starring in the film. And he's doing so while still working on his next film. That's a lot of pressure to be under. More than any other director, John Woo is the one who makes it all look so easy.<br /><br />The plot of "The Tall Target" is a bit convoluted, but it does give Woo the opportunity to show us more of his expertise. The film is set in
